F. Carvalho, Dulee H. S. Silva, Vanderlan S. Bolzani, and Maysa Furlan\n\nInstituto de Quimica, Universidade Estadual Paulista, CP 355, CEP14801-900, Araraquara, SP, Brazil\n\n(phone: + 5516-201-6661; fax: + 55-16-222-7932; e-mail: maysafe@iq.unesp.br)\n\n###### Abstract\n\nA new quinonemethide triterpene named as salacin, has been isolated from the root bark of _Salacia campestris_ in addition to the known pristrimerin, maytenin, 20_a_-hydroxymyatenin, and netzahualcoyene. Salacin was identified on the basis of NMR-spectral and mass spectrometric analysis. The free-radical scavenging activities of the quinonemethide triterpenes salacin (**1**), pristrimerin (**2**), maytenin (**3**), 20_a_-hydroxymytenin (**4**), and netzahualcoyene (**5**) towards DPPH have been evaluated and showed absorbance variation (D_A_) of 19, 20, 39, 28, 55, and 10%, respectively, having rutin (74% at 50 um) and BHT (7% at 50 um) as standard compounds.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nQuinone methide triterpenes are natural products of occurrence restricted to Hippocrateaceae and Celastraceae families. Several representatives of this class are claimed to be medicinally useful [1][2], as antimicrobial [3-5], anticancer [4][6][7], antimalarial [8], and spermicidal compounds [9]. Some _Salacia_ species, _e.g._, _S. reticulata_, _S. oblonga_, and _S. chinesis_, have long been used in India, Sri-Lanka, and China, respectively, as traditional medicines for treating rheumatism and skin diseases, and for their anti-inflammatory properties as well. Recent investigations have confirmed the hepatoprotective and antioxidant properties of _S. reticulata_, and disclosed the presence of catechins as the active principle [10] and aldose reductase inhibition by tingenin B, a quinonemethide from _S. chinensis_[11].\n\nThe antioxidant activity of organic compounds is dependent of few structural features that include, in most cases, the presence of phenolic OH-groups. Thus, flavonoids, lignans, phenylpropanoids, and other aromatic compounds have been the focus of a large number of publications dealing with antioxidant properties [12]. Antioxidant terpenes are rare, and the best known examples include rosamanol and carnosic acid derivatives, abietane diterpenes from sage (_Salvia officinalis_) and rosemary (_Rosmarinus officinalis_), in which the phenolic moiety has been produced during their biosynthesis [13][14]. The antioxidant activities of the quinonemethide triterpenes celastrol, pristrimerin, and acetylcholinesterase have been previously assessed through demonstration of their lipid-peroxidation-inhibition effect in rat liver mitochondria [15]. On the other hand, no data are available on the free-radical scavenging activity of quinonemethide triterpenes. Useful information regarding the antioxidant activity of synthetic and natural products can be obtained from the measurement of their free-radical-scavenging properties, _e.g._, in dilution assays on the reduction of the stable free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) [16].\n\nIn the course of our studies on biosynthesis and bioactive compounds from Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae species [12][17], we describe herein the occurrence\n\n## Page 2\n\nof several quinonemethide triterpenes in _S. campestris_ (Hippocrateaceae) root barks, including the new salacin (**1**), which had its structure determined through MS and NMR analysis, along with the known pristimerin (**2**), maytenin (**3**), 20_a_-hydroxymatenin (**4**), and netzahualcoyene (**5**). In addition, the free-radical scavenging activities of the isolated quinonemethide triterpenes towards DPPH were measured and compared to those of the pentacyclic triterpene friedelin, which co-occurs with the quinoneme-thides in _S. campestris_, and to standard antioxidants BHT and rutin. The variation in the free-radical-scavenging activities due to structural features of the isolates is also discussed.\n\n## 2. Results and Discussion\n\nA CH2Cl2 extract of _Salacia campestris_ root bark was subjected to silica-gel column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the quinonemethide triterpenes **1** - **5**.\n\nSalacin (**1**) was shown to have the molecular formula C28H38O4 by analysis of its ESI mass spectrum and elemental analysis. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3490, 1725, and 1655 cm-1 characteristic of OH, ester C=O, and conjugated C=O groups, respectively. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (_Table_) of **1** showed signals assignable to quinonemethide moiety at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 6.30 (_d_, _J_(7,6) = 7.0, H-C(7)), a _doublet_ at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 6.47 (_J_(1,6) = 1.0, H-C(1)), and a _doublet_ of _doublets_ at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 6.96 (_J_(6,7) = 7.0, _J_(6,1) = 1.0, H-C(6)). The assignments of quinonemethide moiety were confirmed by interpretation of a DQCOSY spectrum, which showed mutual correlation between such H-atoms. The presence of one deshielded Me _singlet_ at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 2.20, assigned to Me(23), associated to a Me _doublet_ at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 0.89 (_J_ = 7.0), confirmed a norquinonemethide skeleton.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe presence of two OH groups was confirmed by signals at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 3.81 (_dd_, _J_(21,20) = 3.5, _J_(21,22) = 2.0, 1 H) and 3.70 (_d_, _J_(22,21) = 2.0, 1 H), attributed to H\\(-\\)C(21) and H\\(-\\)C(22), respectively. The assignments of these two hydroxymethine H-atoms were corroborated by interpretation of the DQCOSY spectrum. The spin system derived from H\\({}_{a}-\\)C(21) and H\\({}_{a}-\\)C(22) was readily recognized by starting with the 1 H _doublet_ of _doublets_ at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 3.81 assigned to H\\({}_{a}-\\)C(21), which showed a cross-peak with the 1 H _doublet_ at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 3.70 assigned to H\\({}_{a}-\\)C(22). The relative configuration of H\\({}_{\\beta}-\\)C(21) and H\\({}_{a}-\\)C(22) was deduced from \\(J\\) values between H\\({}_{\\beta}-\\)C(21) and H\\({}_{\\beta}-\\)C(20) (3.5 Hz), and H\\({}_{\\beta}-\\)C(21) and H\\({}_{a}-\\)C(22) (2.0 Hz), which corroborated the axial - equatorial orientation of H\\(-\\)C(20) and H\\(-\\)C(21), and the equatorial orientation of H\\(-\\)C(22) (_Fig. 1_).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Position & \\({}^{13}\\)C & \\({}^{1}\\)H \\\\\n1 & 120.5 & 6.47 (_d_, _J_(1,6) = 1.2) \\\\\n2 &\n\n## Page 4\n\nThe \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR data were in agreement with the quinonemethide skeleton due to the signals related to conjugated C = C bonds in rings A and B at d(C) 170.4, 146.5, 133.9, 127.5, and 120.5, assigned to C(8), C(3), C(6), C(5), and C(1), respectively. The signals at d(C) 74.0 and 72.2 were attributed to two hydroxymethine C-atoms. The \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR signal at d(C) 18.2 attributed to Me(29) group corroborated a 30-nor-skeleton once quinonemethides with C(29)-nor-skeleton (with d-orientation of the Me group at C(20)) shows the shielded signal for C(30) around d(C) 10.6 - 11.5 [1b]. The positions of these groups were unambiguously assigned by interpretation of the gHMDC spectra (_Fig. 1_). The signal at d(C) 74.0 assigned to C(21) showed correlation with the signal at d(H) 0.89 (H - C(29)); and the signal at d(C) 72.2, assigned to C(22), showed correlation with the signal d(H) 1.14 (H - C(28)). The analysis of gHMDC data was used to assign the signals for all H-bearing C-atoms and allowed the structural determination of the new quinonemethide triterpene salacin (**1**).\n\nPristimerin (**2**) has been previously isolated from _Salacia beddomei_[18] and from _S. kraussii_[19]. Maytenin (**3**) has been described from _S. crassifolia_[4] and _S. macrosperma_[20]. 20_a_-Hydroxymaytenin (**4**) has been reported from _S. macrosperma_[20] and netzahualcoyene (**5**) from _S. reticulata_[21]. Analysis of NMR data of compounds **2** - **5** and comparison with those reported in the literature allowed the identification of these quinonemethide triterpenes.\n\nThe radical-scavenging activity of compounds **1** - **6** has been evaluated towards the stable free radical DPPH, which exhibits an absorption maximum at 517 nm. The free-radical-scavenging activity of the quinonemethide triterpenes is due to the dienone-phenol moiety, which displays great stability to the quinonemethide radical as soon as it has been formed, after hydrogen radical donation to DPPH. Netzahualcoyene (**5**, D_A_ = 55 +- 3% at 50 mm) was more effective than quinonemethides **1** - **4** (D_A_ = 19 +- 2, 20 +- 1, 39 +- 2, and 28 +- 3%, resp., at 50 mm) (_Fig. 2_). Such behavior seems to be associated with the more extended conjugation, which, in the case of compound **5**, is spread through rings A - D and should, therefore, stabilize the netzahualcoyene radical more effectively than the radicals of compounds **1** - **4**, in which the conjugated system is restricted to rings A and B. Conversely, friedelin (**6**, D_A_ = 10 +- 2% at 50 mm), which lacks the dienone-phenol system, was not effective in promoting DPPH reduction and,\n\nFig. 1: _Selected HMDC correlations and \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR coupling constants for salacin_ (**1**)\n\n## Page 5\n\ntherefore, appears as a poor radical scavenger. Structural variations at ring E do not apparently interfere with the free-radical-scavenging activity, although the presence of free hydroxyls and/or carboxyls on ring E might be important in biological systems due to interaction of these groups with cell membranes, affecting lipid peroxidation processes [15]. The comparison of quinonemethide triterpenes and standard compound rutin (D_A_ = 74 +- 4% at 50 mm) evidences the reported major roles of some structural features of flavonoids as the catechol moiety present in ring B of rutin and the C(2) = C(3) bond for the enhancement of the free-radical-scavenging activity [22]. On the other hand, the synthetic antioxidant BHT (D_A_ = 7 +- 1% at 50 mm) exhibited the weakest antiradicalar activity as expected due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH [23]. The use of _Salacia_ and other Hippocrateaceae or Celastraceae species as folk medicines for purposes that include the treatment of gastric ulcer might be related to their content in antiradicalar compounds as flavonoids, which have been described elsewhere (_e.g._, from _Maytenus aquifolium_[12] and _Salacia reticulata_[10]) and the quinonemethide triterpenes described in this work.\n\n### Experimental Part\n\n_General._ Silica gel (_Merck_; 230 - 400 Mesh) was used for column chromatography (CC) unless otherwise stated, and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a _Varian Unity-500_ spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, resp., with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference.

Pereira\n\n# Abstract\n\nTLC autographic assay revealed, in the EtoAc extract obtained from leaves and root bark of _Maytenus aquifolium_ (Celastracaee), the presence of five compounds exhibiting antioxidant properties towards _b_-carotene. They were isolated and identified as epigallocatechin(1), (+) ouratea-catechin (2), proanthocyanidin (3), kaempferol 3-_O-a_-L-mannopyranosyl (1~6)-_O-_b_-D-glucopyranosyl (1~3)-_O-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1~2)-_O-b_-D-glucopyranosyl (4) and quercetin 3-_O-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1~6)-_O-_b_-D-glucopyranosyl (1~3)-_O-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1~2)]-_O-b_-D-glucopyranosyl (5).

The infusion of _M. aquifolium_ leaves is one of the most popular antiulcer traditional drugs in Brazil (Carlini, 1988) and its effectiveness has been proved in ethanol and/or indomethacin-induced gastric lesion models (Bersani-Amado _et al._, 2000; Vilegas _et al._, 1999). Our previous studies on _M. aquifolium_ were carried out on its leaves and root barks and showed the presence of sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids, quinomenthide and friedelane triterpenes (Corsino _et al._, 1998a; 1998b; 2000). On the other hand, nothing has been reported on the antioxidant properties of the constituents of _M. aquifolium_.\n\nTLC analysis using _b_-carotene as a spray reagent (Pratt and Miller, 1984) revealed the presence of antioxidant compounds in the MeOH extract of the leaves and root bark of _M. aquifolium_. Their isolation and identification as catechins and flavonol glycosides were subsequently undertaken. Flavonoids are acknowledged as having interesting medicinal properties as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor activities and are by far the most comprehensively investigated natural products when considering anti-oxidative properties. They are widely distributed in food and could hence play a role in the defense of the organism against oxidative stress (Gordon, 1996; Pietta, 2000). Reactivity of flavonoids has been studied under many experimental conditions and towards several free radicals. These investigations have demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids is mainly due to radical scavenging properties (Cotelle _et al._, 1996; Nanjo _et al._, 1996). In addition, the antioxidant activity of a compound depends ultimately on its ease of oxidation and, for a variety of natural or synthetic compounds, good correlations have been observed between antioxidant activities and low oxidation potentials (Born _et al._, 1996; Chevion _et al._, 2000). The present work deals with the isolation and identification of flavonoids from _M. aquifolium_, which have inhibited the bleaching of _b_-carotene on TLC plates, and the evaluation of parameters related to the antioxidant activity by separately measuring their oxidation potentials through cyclic voltammetry and the free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl).\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### General experimental procedures.\n\nSilica gel (Merck, 230-400 and 70-230 Mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) were used for column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 or Varian INOVA 500 spectrometers at 200 or 500 MHz, respectively, for 1H NMR, and at 50 or 125 MHz, respectively, for 13C NMR, with TMS as internal standard and DMSO-_d_s or MeOH-_d_s as solvent. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. IR and UV spectra were\n\n## Page 2\n\nobtained on Nicolet and Lambda 14P Perkin Elmer spectrophotometers, respectively.\n\n**Plant Material.** Leaves and root bark of _Maytenus aquifolium_ Martius were collected from a private culture in Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo and identified by Dr Rita Maria de Carvalho. A voucher specimen (number HPM0268) is deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Ribeirao Preto (UNAERP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n**Extraction and isolation.** Dried and powdered leaves of _M. aquifolium_ (4.5 kg) were extracted with ethanol. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and concentrated _in vacuum_ to afford a green gum (896.7 g). The EtOHac soluble part of the EtOH extract (5.3 g) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (300.0 g), eluted with MeOH to give 30 fractions. Fraction 13 (0.234 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300.0 g) and eluted with CHCl3/MeOH gradient to give 10 fractions. Fractions 7 and 17 were identified as compounds **2** (0.089 g) and **3** (0.139 g), respectively. The methanol insoluble part of the EtOH extract (2.0 g) was submitted to Sephadex LH 20 column (100.0 g) eluted with MeOH to give 35 fractions. Fraction 10 was applied to a polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) column (6.0 g) eluted with MeOH to afford 15 fractions, yielding **4** (0.093 g) and **5** (0.034 g) as pure compounds. The dried and powdered root bark of _Maytenus aquifolium_ (925.2 g) was extracted with EtOH and concentrated to give a brown gum (17.4 g). The EtOHac soluble part of this extract (2.2 g) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (100.0 g) and eluted with MeOH to give 30 fractions. Fraction 14 was identified as compound **1** (0.017 g).\n\n**Bleaching experiments on b-carotene.** After developing and drying, TLC plates were sprayed with a 0.02% solution of b-carotene (Aldrich) in CH3Cl3. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background. The remaining yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances (Pratt and Miller, 1984).\n\n**Spectrophotometric assay on the reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical.** Reaction mixtures containing test samples (dissolved in MeOH) at several concentrations and 0.004% DPPH methanolic solutions were incubated at 25 degC for 30 min. Absorbanes of the resulting solutions were measured using a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer at 517 nm and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH treated control group (Cuendet _et al._, 1997).\n\n**Electrochemical assay.** The cyclic voltammograms were carried out with a Polarecord E-506 (Metrohm) potentiostat. A three electrode system (663 VA, Metrohm) with a working electrode of glassy carbon (GC), a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a carbon auxiliary electrode was used. DMF (Merck) was used as solvent and tetra-_n_-butyl ammonium tetrafluorate (Merck), as the supporting electrolyte. Rutin (Aldrich) was used as reference compound for its well known electron-reductive properties (Van Acker _et al._, 1996; Peyrat-Maillard _et al._, 2000). The working electrode was polished with aluminium oxide 0.3 u (Buehler) and special polishing cloth (Buehler) prior to each measurement, because formation of a polymeric film inactivated the electrode after each scan. The electrode was then washed thoroughly with water, dried and cycled several times in the range - 1.6 to + 0.6 V in order to reassure the absence of voltammetric signal due to the supporting electrolyte. Each compound was dissolved to concentrations of 10-20 mM in DMF and added to a 15 mL aliquot of the supporting electrolyte. The solutions were then deoxygenated with nitrogen for 10 min and the cyclic voltammograms were carried out at scan rates of 50, 100 or 200 mV/s.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nDried leaves and root barks were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. TLC analysis of the crude extract using b-carotene solution as spray reagent (Pratt and Miller, 1984) revealed the presence of antioxidant compounds. Chromatographic fractionation of this extract guided by the antioxidant assay with b-carotene afforded flavon-3-ols **1-3** and flavonol gycosides **4** and **5** (Fig. 1). Their identification was based on spectrometric data, mainly MS, uni and bidimensional NMR techniques as well as comparison with literature data (Vilegas _et al._, 1999; Agrawal and Bansen, 1989). Specific information on the identity of sugar moieties, including stereochemical aspects, and their position of linkage to the aglycone and to other sugar units followed from extensive analyses of PND and DEPT 135degC NMR, HMBC spectra as well as from analyses of coupling constants of the another hydrogen signals on the 1H NMR spectra of compounds **4** and **5**.\n\nAntioxidative properties of flavonoids **1-5** were evaluated against b-carotene (Pratt and Miller, 1984). Compounds **1-3** and **5** (10 mg) appeared as yellow spots against the TLC plate white background whereas compound **4** (10 mg) appeared as a pale-yellow spot owing to its weaker antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of flavonoids is due to the presence of structural features as _ortho_-dihydroxy groups (usually on B ring), a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and a- and/or b-hydroxyketone groups, which are responsible for chelating properties or enhancement of the radical stabilization after the initial oxidation steps (Bors _et al._, 1990). The lack of a catechol moiety on B ring and a free hydroxy group at C-3 in flavonoid **4** may account for its low ability to protect b-carotene from bleaching and for the higher oxidation potential observed on its cyclic voltammogram when compared to compound **5** (Table 1). These structural features should also be predictive of the poor radical scavenging properties of flavonol **4**, when compared to flavon-3-ols **1-3** and to\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compound & E\\({}_{\\text{rev}}\\) \\\\\n**1** & +0.76 \\\\\n**2** & +0.82 \\\\\n**3** & +0.80 \\\\\n**4** & +0.49 \\\\\n**5** & +0.30 \\\\ Rutin & +0.31 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Oxidation potential from cyclic voltammograms for flavonoids 1-5 and reference compounds rutin and BHT in DMF\n\n## Page 3\n\nthe potent radical scavenging quercetin derivative **5** (Fig. 2).\n\nCatechins **1** and **2** and proanthocyanidin **3** exhibited comparable oxidation potentials owing to the catechol moiety (**2** and **3**) or the 4'-methylpyrogallol group (**1**), which are believed to be the major electrochemically active groups in these compounds. The absence of an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety conjugated to the B ring accounts for their higher oxidation potential when compared to compounds **4** and **5**. The presence of a 4-oxo function on flavonoid **4** gave rise to a b-hydroxy ketone group which probably enhances the ease of flavonoid oxidation, resulting in the oxidation peak at + 0.48 V on its cyclic voltammogram. These structural features, in addition to the catechol moiety on the B ring of flavonoid **5**, conferred the highest stabilization ability for this quercetin derivative, resulting in the lowest oxidation potential (+ 0.30V) among flavonoids **1-5**.\n\nThe association of antioxidant and antiulcer activities evidencing gastroprotective effect of antioxidants after stressor-induced oxidative damage on gastric mucosa has been demonstrated by several means: through induction of anti-lipoperoxidase processes, enhancement of free-radical scavenging and antioxidant enzymes (e.g. glutathione peroxidase: GSH-Px) activity and/or reduction of the main sources of oxygen radicals in such systems, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) (Osakabe _et al._, 1998; La Casa _et al._, 2000).\n\nAntioxidant-rich fractions (e.g. polyphenols) from plant extracts have been extensively used in experimental models to prove their inhibitory effect on induced ulceration. (Osakabe _et al._, 1998; Vilegas _et al._, 1999). Pure compounds have also been submitted to antiulcer activity evaluation. The protective effect of trutin, a widespread flavonoid glycoside, against ethanol-induced gastric lesions as well as the inhibition of gastric H', K'-ATPase by catechins have already been assessed (Murakami _et al._, 1992; La Casa _et al._, 2000). The quantification of flavonoids in _M. aquifolium_ has been recently performed and showed that flavonoids are the major compounds, representing ca 7.6% of the dry EtOH extract (Leite _et al._, 2001). The presence of significant amounts of antioxidant hydrosoluble flavonoids in the leaves of _Maytenus aquifolium_ may therefore consist evidence for the efficiency of its infusion as an antinulcer agent and legitimate its ethnopharmacological use.\n\n## References\n\n- This work was funded by grants of the State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) within the Biota-FAPESP\n- The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biotasp.org.br); Grants _missing_ 98/05074-0 and _missing_ 97/10184-7 awarded to VSB and MF, respectively.\n\nFigure 1: Flavonoids from _Maytenus aquifolium_.\n\nFigure 2: Radical scavenging properties of flavonoids **1–5** and standard compound trutin.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Agrawal PK, Bansal MC. 1989. _Carbon-13 NMR of Flavonoids_.

These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide _N_-[7-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_),4(_Z_)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of _Piper hispidum_ H.B.K. (Alecio et al., 1998).\n\nIn this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elucidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (_3Z_,_5Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptacionamide (**1**), (_S_Z_)-N_-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-D\\({}^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one (**2**) and also of eight known antifungal amides _N_-[3-(6'-methoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_)-propenoylpyrrolidine (**3**), piperamine (**4**), _N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-D\\({}^{3}\\) -pyridin-2-one (**5**), piperatine (**6**), piperine (**7**), D\\({}^{\\alpha,\\beta,}\\)-dihydropyiperine (**8**), 5,6-dihydropyiperlonguminine (**9**) and pellitorine (**10**). The amides isolated from stems of _Piper hispidum_ (**1**, **3** and **4**) and from seeds of _Piper tuberculatum_ (**2**, **5-10**) were active against the fungus _Cladosporium sphareospermum_ as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nA CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of _P. hispidum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by HPLC purification to afford the compounds **1, 3** and **4**.\n\nCompound **1**, has a molecular formula C\\({}_{18}\\)H\\({}_{23}\\)NO\\({}_{3}\\) as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) and of the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cm \\({}^{1}\\). Its \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at \\(d\\) 5.91 (2H, _s_), and four olefine protons which showed signals at \\(d\\) 5.45 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)3,4 = 12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)4,3 and 4,5 = 12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)5,4 and 5,6 = 12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, _dt_, \\(J\\)6,5 and 6,7 = 12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that both double bonds\n\n## Page 2\n\npossess the Z configuration (Alecio et al., 1998; Shah et al. 1986). The assignments of these olefinic protons were confirmed by analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylene protons H-8 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.62 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J_{8,7}\\) = 7.0 Hz) and H-7 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.46 (2H, m) were confirmed by the DQ-COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 5.94, 1H) could be also observed.\n\nThe presence of a isobutyl moiety was confirmed by the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.13 (2H, \\(dd\\), \\(J_{1^{\\prime},2^{\\prime}}\\) = 7.0 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 1.80 (1H, \\(m\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 0.92 (6H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{3^{\\prime},2^{\\prime}\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nexchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of **1** are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-field region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at \\(d\\) 166.5, ten olefinic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [d_C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at \\(d\\) 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (Alecio et al., 1998; Araujo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of **1** was determined as (3\\(Z\\),5_Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide.\n\nA CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of _P. tuberculatum_ was fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to afford compounds **2** and **5-10**.\n\nCompound **2**, was shown to have a molecular formula C17H19NO5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) and of 13C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cm 1 (asymmetric C-O-C stretching). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** revealed the presence of methoxyphenyl groups by the signals at \\(d\\) 3.84 (6H, _s_), \\(d\\) 3.85 (3H, _s_), one aromatic proton signal at \\(d\\) 6.76 (2H, _s_) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four olefinic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spectrum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at \\(d\\) 6.48 assigned to H-8 (_J_8,9 = 12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at \\(d\\) 6.71 assigned to H-9 (_J_9,8 = 12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the \\(Z\\) configuration. The attribution of this configuration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the \\(Z\\) isomer when compared with the \\(E\\) isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at \\(d\\) 5.98 (_J_3,4 and 3,5 = 9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at \\(d\\) 6.89 (_J_4,3 and 4,5 = 9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at \\(d\\) 5.98 (_J_3,4 and 3,5 = 9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at \\(d\\) 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at \\(d\\) 3.97 (_J_6,5 = 7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-field region of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four olefinic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at \\(d\\) 165.7 and 168.1. The assignments\n\n## Page 4\n\nof the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at \\(d\\) 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at \\(d\\) 6.48 (H-8) and \\(d\\) 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at \\(d\\) 165.7 was assigned to C-2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at \\(d\\) 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-field region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [_d_c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at \\(d\\) 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide **2** was defined as 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-D3-pyridin-2-one.\n\n_N_- (12, 13, 14- Trimethoxyphenylhydrocinnamoyl)-D3 -pyridin -2- one (**5**), D_a_b_- dihydropyiperine (**8**) and 5,6-dihydropyiperlonguminine (**9**) have the molecular formula C17H21NO5, C17H21NO3 and C16H21NO3, respectively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from _Piper rugosum_ (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), _Piper guineense_ (Parmar et al., 1997) and _P. tuberculatum_ (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the first time.\n\n_N_-[3-(6'-methoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenyl]pyrrolidine (**3**) was previously isolated from _Piper pequloides_ (Shah et al., 1986) and _P. hispidum_ (Alecio et al., 1998). Piperamine (**4**) was previously obtained from _Piper nigrum_ (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and _P. hispidum_ (Alecio et al., 1998). Piplartine (**6**) was previously described from _Piper aborescens_ (Duh et al., 1990) and _P. tuberculatum_ (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (**7**) was previously described from _P. aborescens_ and _P. tuberculatum_ (Araujo-Junior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (**10**) had been reported from _Cissampelos glaberrina_ (Rosario et al., 1996).\n\nThe antifungal activity of amides **1-10** was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds **1-10** are shown in Table 3 and were performed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of _C. sphaerospermum_ growth at that level were considered inactive.\n\nThe minimum quantity of compounds **1-4**, **6**, **8-10** necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for **7** and **5** the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively. The values for **7** and **5** were comparable to those observed for the reference compounds miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg).\n\n_P. hispidum_ and _P. tuberculatum_ have accumulated amides with _cis_ geometry in their side chain, which is a structural feature quite rare in nature (Alecio et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1986).\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and sol\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline Carbons & **5** & **8** & **9** \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 165.4 (s) & 43.0 (t) & 166.0 (s) \\\\\n3 & 125.8 (d) & 25.5 (t) & 120.8 (d) \\\\\n4 & 145.2 (d) & 24.6 (t) & 142.6 (d) \\\\\n5 & 24.6 (t) & 26.7 (t) & 33.8 (t) \\\\\n6 & 41.0 (t) & 46.8 (t) & 34.1 (t) \\\\\n\n## Page 5\n\nvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reverse phase column (Waters Nova Pack, C18; 3.9 x 150 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (3:2), flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 260 nm. Elemental analysis were performed on a Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Piper hispidum_ H.B.K. stems were collected in Parque Estadual do Morro do Diabo, Teodoro Sampaio, SP and identified by Dr. Waldir Mantovani (Instituto de Biociencias -- USP). _P. tuberculatum_ Jacq. seeds were collected in the Campus do INPA (Manaus) and identified by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias -- USP, Sao Paulo.\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\nThe microorganism used in the antifungal assay _C.phaerospermum_ (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay -- 10 ul of solutions corresponding to 100 ug of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 ug of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of _C. spharoospermum_ in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25degC. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the minimal amount of **1-10** required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 ug) and miconazole (0.5 ug) were used as positive controls.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nThe dried and powdered stems of _P. hispidum_ (28.0 g) were extracted with CH2Cl2 (3x150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give **1** (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give **3** (0.004 g). Frs containing **4** were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of _P. tuberculatum_ (24.3 g) were extracted CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 x 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromatographic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **2** (0.024 g) and **6** (0.003 g). Fraction 20 (0.146 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **5** (0.005 g). Fraction 19 (0.083 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions] to yield **7** (0.012 g) and **8** (0.007 g). Frs. 8 and 13 yielded **10** (0.079 g) and **9** (0.018 g), respectively.\n\n### (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxy-phenyl)-heptadienamide (1)\n\nFound: C, 71.54; H, 7.56; N, 4.45; O, 16.43%.

The compounds were separated by recycling-HPLC, and their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. CD measurements were used to establish the absolute configuration of the anthrone and oxanthrone.

Further investigations afforded, in minor quantities, two new _C,O_-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picraminoside F (**1**), and an anthrone, mayoside C (**2**), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**3**) and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of compounds **1** and **2**, and the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe EtOAc extract from the bark of _P. taepensis_ afforded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds **1**-**4**, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shimadzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones **3** and **4** were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992).\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-molecular ions at \\(m/z\\) 671 ([M+1]\\({}^{+}\\)), 693 ([M+Na]\\({}^{+}\\)) and 709 ([M+K]\\({}^{+}\\)), with the base peak at \\(m/z\\) 509 ([M+1-C6H10O5]\\({}^{+}\\)). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAll of the spectroscopic characteristics of **1** were coincident with those of anthrones which we have previously reported (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at _l_max 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)), ester carbonyl (1735 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) groups. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at \\(d\\) 7.4-7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of _meta_-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at \\(d\\) 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at \\(d\\) 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at \\(d\\) 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at \\(d\\) 3.40-3.95, indicating sugar moieties.\n\nThe presence of 33 carbons was evident from the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at \\(d\\) 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at \\(d\\) 95.8 and \\(d\\) 105.4. Signals in the region of \\(d\\) 62-81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D-E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agreement with lyxose (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on Solis et al. (1995) which identified the sugar of picramniosides A-C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-_O_ were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments confirmed only one CH\\({}_{2}\\) signal at \\(d\\) 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit.\n\nComplete assignment of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In particular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between the ester carbonyl (_d_ 164.7) and H-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\), H-2\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) and H-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\), indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) (_d_ 81.4), confirming the position of the aglycone at C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a \\({}^{3}J\\) correlation of the anomeric\n\n## Page 3\n\nproton of the glucose unit (H-1, \\(d\\) 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the _O_-glucose unit at C-8.\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between H-5' and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. The configuration of the lysrose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (Solis et al., 1995; Hernandez-Medel et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-1' and H-2' (_J_ = 0 Hz) suggesting an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. Likewise, the \\(J\\) value of H-5'' (12 Hz) indicated an _ax_-_ax_ conformation for H-5'' and H-4'' in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety.\n\nFurther observations helped to establish the configuration at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of **1** (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picraminoside E (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the following expected differences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to _O_-glucosylation at C-8.\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of **2** gave pseudo-molecular ions at _m_/_z_ 709 ([M + Na]+) and 725 ([M + K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]-), which was consistent with the molecular formula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS-MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (_m_/_z_ 563), lysose (_m_/_z_ 432), CH2OH (_m_/_z_ 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corresponding to emodin (269).\n\nAs observed previously for the mayosides (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed the same pattern described for **1**, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of **2** had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). _O_-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound **2** at ring A.\n\nAsignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with published data (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not afford all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1'' with C-1 (_d_ 162) helped to confirm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1''.\n\nCircular dichroism confirmed the absolute configuration at C-10 of **1** and **2** as \\(S\\) and \\(R\\), respectively.

(1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds **3** and **4** presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in _Sesamm indicum_. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nMp: uncorr.; IR: BOMEM-FT-IR; UV: Hewlett Packard 8452A; 1H NMR, COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HSQC, HMBC and 13C NMR, in methanol-_d__a_, containing TMS as int. standard: Bruker DRX-400; ESIMS: Micromass Quattro LC, HRMS: Autospec-Micromass EBE.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe bark of _P. taepensis_ was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San Jose de la Montana, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica.\n\n### Isolation of constituents\n\nDried and powdered bark of _P. taepensis_ (615 g) was macerated with EtOH-H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then _n_-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC.

Inacio, Geraldo H. Silva, Helder L. Teles, Henrique C. Trevisan, Alberto J. Cavalheiro, Vanderlan da S. Bolzani, Maria C.M. Young, Ludwig H. Pfenning, Angela R. Araujo\n\n# Abstract\n\n## 1 Subject and source\n\nIn the course of our continuous search for bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi living in plants from Cerrado and Atlantic Forest (Cafeu et al., 2005; Teles et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005), healthy leaves of _Cryptocarya manlioccana_ were submitted to isolation of endophytes and 15 strains were isolated. Among them _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (Penz) Penz & Sacc., was selected for chemical and biological investigation because of the strong antifungal activity of the crude EtOAc extract against the phytopathogenic fungi _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _Cladosporium sphareospermum_.\n\n_C. gloeosporioides_ was identified by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited in the fungal herbarium of the Universidade Federal de Lavras (CML 737).\n\n## 2 Previous work\n\n_Colletotrichum_ spp. have been reported as endophytes of some plants. Aspergillus Aspergillusiformisamins B (Ballio et al., 1969), aspergillomarasmine A (Bousquet et al., 1971), gloeosporone (Meyer et al., 1987), ferricocin (Ohra et al., 1995), diketopiperazines (Trigos et al., 1997), polysaccharides (Park et al., 2001) and colletotrich acid, 3B,5a,6b-trihydroxyergosta-7,22-diene, uracil and lumin chrome (Zou et al., 2000) have been isolated from _C. gloeosporioides_.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 3 Present study\n\n_C. gloeosporioides_ was subcultured in Petri plates containing PDA and incubated for seven days. After this period, it was inoculated at 25\\(-\\)28 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in 20 \\(\\times\\) 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 200 mL of Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB). The cultures were incubated at 25 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C and aerated by agitation on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 28 days. The filtered fermentation broth (ca. 4.0 L) was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 1.5 L); the organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and concentrated to yield 195.3 mg of crude extract.\n\nThe crude extract was cleaned-up in reversed-phase silica gel (C-18) using MeOH as eluent and subsequently purified by reversed-phase preparation HPLC [C-18 column - Phenomenex-Luna (210 x 21.2 mm), \\(\\lambda = 254\\) nm, 10.0 mL/min, H2O:MeOH (75:25) to MeOH (100%) over 120 min], affording (-) _cis_-4-hydroxy-6-deoxyscytalone (**1**) [22.8 mg, \\(I_{\\text{R}} = 25\\) min, \\(\\alpha_{\\text{O}}^{25} - 133\\) (ca. 0.024, CHCl3)] and (4_R_)-4,8-dihydroxy-a-tetradone (**2**) [10.1 mg, \\(t_{\\text{R}} = 60\\) min, \\(\\alpha_{\\text{O}}^{25} - 17.7\\) (ca. 0.018, CHCl3)]. The chemical structure of these compounds was elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectral data and by comparison with those reported in the literature (Venkatasubbaiah and Chilton, 1992; Krohn et al., 2002; Aldridge et al., 1974; Kokubun et al., 2003; Machida et al., 2005).\n\nThe antifungal activity of **1** and **2** was evaluated by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Rahalison et al., 1991). The detection limit of these compounds required to inhibit growth of the phytopathogenic fungi _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ was 5.0 mg, comparable with the positive control nystatin.\n\n## 4 Ecological significance\n\nThe strong antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungi _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ of the compounds **1** and **2** suggests that the endophytic fungi _C. gloeosporioides_ in _C. mandioccana_ could protect the host by producing metabolites, which may be toxic or even lethal to phytopathogens, and highlights the potential of endo-phytic fungi in producing bioactive metabolites.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of _C. gloeosporioides_ as an endophytic fungus inhabiting plants from Brazilian Atlantic Forest and _C. mandioccana_.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was funded by grants from the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) within the Biot-FAPESP - The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br); Grant # 03/02176-7 awarded to Dr. Bolzani, principal investigator.

The recovery of compounds **1-6** was determined by comparison with LC-atmosphere pressure chemical ionization MS/MS data: 662.52, 93.1%, 102.5%, 301.2%, 59.0% and 84.9%, respectively. Compound **3** showed IC50 of 23.6 mM against _Plasmodium falciparum_ and 15.6 mM against _Tympanosoma brucei rhodesines_ and was not toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 mM).\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nand _T. brucei rhodesiense_ [8]. These promising results have stimulated us to test some 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid derivatives for activity against these parasites. Preliminary assay was performed on methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), which showed activity against both _P. falciparum_ and _T. brucei rhodesiense_. However, compound **3** has been isolated from _Horia oreadia_ taprots in small amount, and then the MICs were not determined. Compounds **1-3** (Fig. 1) were isolated from _H. oreadia_ taprots [3,4].\n\nFurthermore, if it is assumed that it is possible to modify the chemical structure of compounds in order to improve activity and selectivity on the above assays, phytochemical studies of other organs of _H. oreadia_ deserve more attention. Thus, we have now examined the leaves of _H. oreadia_ since they have never been investigated before. The leaves afforded the known limonol guyanin (**1**), the alkaloids rutaeacripin (**2**) and dicramine (**6**), the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**), together with the new _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**) (Fig. 1).\n\nGenerally, the conventional methods including silica gel, polyamide and reversed-phase liquid chromatography are often used to isolate pure products from _H. oreadia_, but they are tedious, time consuming and usually require multiple chromatographic steps [9-11]. Counter-current chromatography (CCC), a liquid-liquid partition chromatography method, has a track record of being a powerful tool in the preliminary stages of crude extract fractionation [12-15]. With the ability to attain high resolution, modern CCC and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) instrumentation, such as HSCC and fast-centrifugal partition chromatography (FCP), have significant potential to develop new approaches in natural product drug discovery, specifically towards reducing the expensive and time-consuming steps to isolate active constituents. Due to the lack of a solid stationary phase, CCC has no irreversible adsorption and, therefore, provides loss-less fractionation [16]. Since samples are simply partitioned between different solvents phases, there is 100% theoretical sample recovery. In crude plant extract fractionation this is particularly valuable because it minimizes the chances of losing the activity during fractionation. This benefit of CCC allows researchers to address the issues of synergy between compounds to explain biological activity in plants, without the need to address potential irreversible adsorption of active constituents to the solid stationary phase during fractionation [14,17]. Therefore, HSCC was used for separation and purification of compounds **1-6** from dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. oreadia_.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Apparatus\n\nThe HSCC instrument employed in the present study was manufactured by P.C. Inc., Potomac, MD 20854, USA. It contained a quadruple multilayer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The \\(b\\) value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (_b_ = _r_/_R_, where \\(r\\) is the distance from the coil to the holder, and \\(R\\), the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis and the central shaft). The sample injection loop volume was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus was regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The flow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, NY, USA) constant-flow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector (Eyela, DC-1200); Liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS/MS) data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography equipped with a PDA2996 photodiode array detection (DAD) system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a _Z_-Spray API ion source and a megaflow electrospray probe; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): on a Bruker DXB 400 and 100 MHz with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard; infrared (IR): Bomen-FT-IR; ultraviolet (UV): Varian 500 Scan UV-Vis (visible)-NIR (near infrared); gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS): low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument. For low-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (APCI-MS), a Micromass Quattro LC instrument was used, equipped with a \"Z-spray\" ion source.\n\n### Reagents\n\nAll organic solvents used for HSCC were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and for LC-APCI-MS/MS were HPLC grade purchased from J.T. Baker (Ecatepec, Mexico).Water purified (18 M<OMEGA>) by a reverse osmosis Milli\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structures of compounds from _H. oreadia_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nQ system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for all solutions and dilutions.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe leaves of _H. oreadia_ were collected in January 2001 in Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. The identification was carried out by Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, Sao Paulo University and vouchers are deposited in the Herbarium of the same department.\n\n### Preparation of crude sample\n\nThe leaves (3.2 kg) of _H. oreadia_ were dried carefully by forced air at 40 degC and reduced to powder. The powdered dried leaves were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH at room temperature three times. After the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (93.0 g), dichloromethane (161.0 g) and methanol (42.0 g).\n\n### Selection of two-phase solvent system\n\nSmall amounts of dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. oreadia_ were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the compounds allowed to partition between the two phases [18,19]. The distribution of the components between both phases of each the 5 solvents systems were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using 20 cm x 20 cm silica gel plates with a thickness of 0.20 mm (silica gel 60 F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), on which the crude extract was horizontally spotted. The solvent system used for the development of the TLC plates was hexane-ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v). The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with a solution of vanillin reagent (5 g of vanillin in 9 mL of methanol, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 and 3 drops of acetic acid) followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of compounds into each phase. The partition coefficients were determined by GC-MS only for the best solvent system as follows: 0.5 mg of dichloromethane extract was added to a test tube, to which 5 mL of each phase of the two-phase solvent system was added. The test tube was shaken as above, and then the upper and lower phases were analyzed by GC-MS. The partition coefficients of three compounds in sample were determined according to the peak areas.\n\n### Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution\n\nThe two-phase solvent system composed of hexane-ethanol-acetonitrile-water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separatory funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The upper phase and the lower phase were separated and degassed by sonication for 20 min shortly before use.\n\nSample solutions were prepared by dissolving the dichloromethane extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v).\n\n### GC-MS analysis\n\nThe partition coefficient and HSCCC fractions were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph fitted with a fused silica DB-5 (30 m x 0.32 mm LD, 0.25 mm film thickness) capillary column with helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. The temperature was programmed initially at 100 degC for 1 min, and then increased with a rate of 10 degC min-1 to 250 degC, the latter maintained for 30 min. The injection (1 mL) was split and its temperature was 280 degC. The interface temperature was 250 degC. The chromatograph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass-selective detector at 70 eV.\n\n### HSCCC separation\n\nThe upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elution mode. First, the coiled column was entirely filled with the stationary phase (lower phase). Then the apparatus was rotated forward at 800 rpm, while the mobile phase (upper phase) was pumped into the column in a tail to head direction at a flow rate of 3.0 mL min-1. The retention of stationary phase (_SF_) was 85% (_SF_ = 0.85). After the mobile phase front emerged and the hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution containing 2.5 g of the dichloromethane extract was injected through the injection module at a flow rate of 3.0 mL min-1. A total of 34 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an automated fraction collector. However, with 24 fractions all compounds obtained have already eluted.\n\n### TLC analysis of fractions obtained by HSCCC\n\nAll HSCCC fractions collected were monitored by TLC (20 cm x 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254) with hexane-ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v) as the developing solvent. Based on the TLC plates monitoring, all HSCC fractions were combined into 8 analytically distinct fractions. Fractions 1-2 afforded 5.8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**, 0.240 g), fraction 3 furnished _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**, 0.045 g) and fraction 5 yielded methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), (0.148 g). Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with _n_-hexane-Me2CO (8:2) affording guyanin (**1**, 0.04 g). Fraction 6 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:4) to give rutaceargin (**2**, 0.11 g). Fractions 7-8 were purified as fraction 6 to yield dictannine (**6**, 0.088 g).\n\n### LC-APCI-MS/MS\n\nLC-APCI-MS/MS data were acquired using a 3.0 mm x 30 mm, 3.5 mm XTerra-MS C-18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively, each one supplemented with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, TFA): 20% line B at the beginning then goes to 30% B and 30% C in 9 min; the column was then washed with 20% line B and 80% line C for 4 min and re-conditioned with 20% line B for 3 min; a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1 was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210-500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post UV-detector splitter was used to send only 0.3 mL min-1 to the ion source; nitrogen was used for nebulization (200 L h-1) and desolvation (785 L h-1); the corona discharge was set at 3.27 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 27 and 4 V respectively; argon (Ar) was used for the fragmentation experiments and the parent ions were accelerated using a collision energy ramp of 1-25 eV. For SRM experiments, the cone voltage was maintained using tune parameters previously optimized for all compounds at 27 V, and two transitions were selected for each compound (Fig. 2): for **1**, _m/z_ 499 - 397 (monitoring) and _m/z_ 499 - 343 (quantification), using a collision energy (CE) of 20 eV; for compound \\(2\\), _m/z_ 288 - 244 (quantification) and _m/z_ 288 - 169 (monitoring) (CE 25 eV); for compound **3**_m/z_ 307 - 203 (monitoring) and _m/z_ 307 - 233 (quantification) (CE = 25 eV); for compound **4**_m/z_ 293 - 201 (monitoring) and _m/z_ 293 - 233 (quantification) (CE = 25 eV); for compound **5**_m/z_\n\n## Page 4\n\n313 \\(\\to\\) 251, 313 \\(\\to\\) 176, 313 \\(\\to\\) 151 (monitoring) and \\(m/z\\) 313 \\(\\to\\) 297 (quantification) (CE = 25 eV); for compound **6** \\(m/z\\) 200 \\(\\to\\) 129 (monitoring) and \\(m/z\\) 200 \\(\\to\\) 185 (quantification) (CE = 20 eV). The dwell time was 0.08 s, and the interscan delay was 0.1 s. The collision gas pressure (argon) was set at 1.35e\\(-\\)3 mbar for all experiments.\n\n#### Software\n\nAll MS data were acquired and processed using MassJynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, UK).\n\n#### Calibration standard and analytical curves\n\nStock solutions (1000 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\)) of compounds **1-6** were prepared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, HPLC grade, Eatepec, Mexico). Working solutions were prepared at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) by diluting stock solutions. Calibration standards curves were obtained in triplicates. For each point of the analytical curves, the worst value in comparison with the average was discarded. Calibration curves were obtained plotting concentration (\\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\)) in axis \\(x\\) per area below SRM peaks (arbitrary units) in axis \\(y\\) (average of three runs).\n\n#### Sample preparation\n\nThe dichloromethane extract (30 mg) was re-suspended in 3.0 mL of HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) in centrifuge tubes by vortex agitation (Phoenix AP56, Araraquara, SP Brazil) for 30 s at the maximum possible speed. The obtained solution was filtered (PTFE Millipore, 53a Paulo, Brazil, d. 25.0 mm and p. 0.20 \\(\\mu\\)m), and then diluted appropriately and used for quantification of compounds **1-6** by LC-APCI-MS/MS.\n\n### Biological assays\n\nStock solutions of the compounds, plus control drugs, were prepared at a concentration of 20 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, UK), and diluted to appropriate concentration prior to assays. IC50 values were calculated with MSXLFT (IDBS, UK).\n\n#### P. falciparum\n\nChloroquine-sensitive _P. falciparum_ strain 3D7 was maintained in human A+ erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, UK) supplemented with Albumax II at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. _P. falciparum_ intraerythrocytic cultures were set up as above, with 1% ring stage parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit, in triplicate in 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of medium in 96 well, flat-bottomed Microtest III tissue plates. Drugs were added in threefold dilution series and cultures incubated for a total of 48 h at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. After 24 h, (3H) hypoxanthine (0.2 mCi) was added to each well. At the end of the assay, plates were rapidly freezetwahed, harvested using a Tomtec Mach III cell harvested (Tomtec, CT) onto a 96-well format filtermat and Meltilex solid scintillant (both Wallac, Finland) added prior to reading in a Microbeta 1450 scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland) at 1 min per well.\n\n#### T. brucei rhodiesense\n\n_T. brucei rhodiesense_ STIB900 blood stream form trypanastigotes were maintained in HMI-18 medium, with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HarlanSeralLab, UK) at 37degC in 5% CO2-air mixture. Prior to drugging, trypanastigotes were washed and re-suspended in fresh medium at a concentration 2 x 105 mL\\({}^{- 1}\\), and 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of this suspension was added to the drug dilutions. The top concentration for the test compounds was 30 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\). Pentamidine was included as the standard drug. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4-5 h on Gemini fluorescent plate reader (Sofimax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a filter cut-off at 550 nm.\n\n#### Cytotoxicity assays\n\n96-well plates were seeded with KB cells at a concentration of 2 x 104 mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) (100 \\(\\mu\\)L per well). Drugs at 300, 30, 3 and 0.3 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) were added in fresh overlay after 24 h, in triplicate at each concentration. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4-5 h on Gemini fluorescent plate reader (Sofimax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a filter cut-off at 550 nm. IC50 values were calculated against the blanks\n\nFig. 2: Second-generation ion product spectra obtained under CID-MS/MS: Compounds **1** (20 eV); **2** (25 eV); **3** (25 eV); **4** (25 eV); **5** (25 eV); **6** (250 eV).

The content of compounds in the crude extracts is important to determine their recovery in HSCC analyses. The mobile phase was determined after testing different compositions of solvents. A good chromatographic resolution was achieved using a 9 min gradient, beginning with 20% acetonitrile then going to 30% acetonitrile and 30% methanol. This mobile phase provided both excellent separation between all six compounds and good ionization levels under the APCI ion source. The SRM transitions were chosen on the basis of the stability of products obtained under collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS. The second-generation product ion spectra of compounds **1-6** showed intense protonated molecules ([M + H+]) at _m/z_ 499, 288, 307, 293, 313 (_m/z_ 313 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the protonated molecular ion _m/z_ 359), and 200 respectively. The product ions chosen to form the transitions in SRM mode during the development and application of the method provided an excellent specificity to the method, as shown by the SRM chromatograms (Fig. 3) and second-generation ion product spectra obtained under CID-MS/MS (Fig. 2). Regression analysis of the least-square line for data acquired from the external standard calibration curves showed good linearity at a 0.01-1.0 mg mL-1 concentration range of six compounds, with a correlation coefficient above 0.997 for all curves. The content of guyanin (**1**), rutaeacrpin (**2**), methyl 5.7-dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), 5.8-dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**), _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**), and dictamarine (**6**) in the crude extract were 2.42%, 4.80%, 5.78%, 9.82%, 1.80%, 4.15%, respectively, and showed RSD ranging from 0.03 to 2.11%, as determined by HPLC-APCI-MS/MS (Table 1).\n\n### CCC solvent system\n\nThe essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvents. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. However, this is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent. For efficient separation, it is important that the partition coefficient (_K_) of the target compounds should lie in the range 0.5 < \\(K\\) < 2.0, and the separation factor between any two components (\\(\\alpha = k2/k1\\), \\(k\\)2 > \\(k\\)1) should be greater than 1.5. A smaller \\(K\\) value results in a loss of peak resolution, while a larger value produces excessive band broadening. To ensure a satisfactory retention of the stationary phase, the settling time of the solvent system should be shorter than 30 s. In order to avoid wastage of solvent, it is recommended that the two-phase system under consideration produces similar volumes of each phase [20]. It is also essential to consult solvent systems used in countercurrent chromatography that can be found in the specialised literature, e.g. [18,21,22,23].\n\nVarious techniques can be used for analysis of the best solvent system. Thin-layer chromatography is a very rapid way of guiding method development. A small amount of the sample is thoroughly mixed in a vial with equal volumes of the upper and lower phases of the chosen solvent system. The same volume of each phase is applied to a TLC plate which is then allowed to migrate in the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Compounds & Content in the crude extract (\\%) & Yielded by HSCC (g) & HSCC recovery (\\%) \\\\ LC–APCI-MS/MS & & & \\\\\n1 & 2.42 ± 0.03 & 0.040 & 66.2 \\\\\n2 & 4.80 ± 2.11 & 0.110 & 93.1 \\\\\n3 & 5.78 ± 0.05 & 0.148 & 102.5 \\\\\n4 & 9.82 ± 1.42 & 0.240 & 101.2 \\\\\n5 & 1.80 ± 0.18 & 0.045 & 99.0 \\\\\n6 & 4.15 ± 0.53 & 0.088 & 84.9 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Concentration of compounds **1–6** quantified simultaneously by LC–APCI-MS/MS in dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. orendica_.\n\nFigure 3: SRM chromatograms obtained during the quantification of compounds **1–6** on dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. orendica_.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\norganic phase of the two-phase solvent system. An optimal system gives an equal distribution between the two phases and Rf values of the sample components between 0.2 and 0.5. If the sample is found almost exclusively in one phase, the solvent system is obviously of no use. It should be noted that the Rf value gives only an approximate indication of the appropriateness of a particular solvent because TLC involves both partition and adsorption mechanisms, whereas CCC is based on purely liquid-liquid partition phenomena [20].\n\nThe following polar two-phase solvent systems were tested: chloroform-methanol-water (5:4:3, v/v), dichloromethane-methanol-water (4:5:3, v/v), hexane-ethanol-acetonitrile-water (10:8:1:1, v/v), hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (3:7:5:5, v/v), hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:1:1, v/v), hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (5:5:4:5, v/v), hexane-ethanol-methanol-water (10:7:10:8, v/v), hexane-ethanol-methanol-water (10:10:9:11, v/v), and hexane-chloroform-methanol-water (3:6:3:2, v/v). Out of the 9 candidate biphasic solvent systems, 4 were rejected, as the settling times were either too long, emulsions were formed when extract was added, or suitable partitioning did not occur. The remaining 5 solvent systems gave reasonable separation on TLC, however, only hexane-ethanol-acetonitrile-water (10:8:1:1, v/v) showed similar distribution among the two phases with the Rf values approximately 0.3 between the components, and therefore it was used for the CCC separation. The partition coefficients determined by GC-MS with this solvent system for compounds **3-5** obtained in one-step separation were 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1, respectively. 5.8-Dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**) was obtained in a pure form at tubes 1-11, _E_-3-4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**) at tubes 12-14, and methyl 5.7-dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propionate (**3**) at tubes 20-22. The GC-MS of these compounds was shown in Fig. 4. The recovery of compounds **3-5** of 2.5 g of crude extract in a one-step separation were 102.5%, 101.2%, 99.0% (Table 1), respectively, which were determined by comparison with HPLC-APCI-MS/MS data. Guyanin (**1**) was obtained after column chromatography on silica gel, rutae-carpin (**2**) and dictamine (**6**) on Sephadex LH-20, however, their recoveries were also excellent 66.2%, 93.1% and 84.9% (Table 1), respectively.\n\n### The structural identification of the compounds\n\nThe structures of isolated compounds were identified on the basis of spectral data, particularly 1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, and APCI-MS/MS, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those from the literature. Compounds **1** and **2** have previously been isolated from _Hortica regia_ [24], **3** and **4** from _H. colombiana_ [25] and dictamine (**6**) from _H. longifolia_ [26] (Fig. 1).\n\nThe new compound _E_-3.4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbo methoxyphenyl) cinnamic acid was identified as **5** (Fig. 1) on the basis of the following data: Amorphous white solid. UV _l_max/nm (CHCl3) 215, 200, 24; IR _v_max/cm-1 (lio, film) 3019, 2927, 2854 (CH), 1734 (carboxyl group), 1738 (ester), 1626; 1518, 1464, 1441, 1379, 1262, 1215, 756, 669. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 722 (1H, \\(d\\), _H_-2, _J_=2.0 Hz)\n\n## Page 7\n\nacid with the selective action on the parasites, and **3** was not toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 mM). The 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acids represent a novel class of compounds tested for the first time as antimalarial and trypanediol agents. Unfortunately, the other compounds showed no appreciable activity against _P. falciparum_ and _T. brucei_ rhodesines (IC50 > 100 mM). Activity appears to be associated with a methyl ester function, since _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid **5** and 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid **4** were inactive against both protozoan. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, derivatives **4** and **5** will be converted in methyl ester and assayed again.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCompounds 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**). _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbonate hoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**) and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**) were obtained in one-step HSCCC separation. The one-step separation was more rapid (1 h and 20 min) and less solvents consuming, while conventional methods of CC for separation of guyanin (**1**), rutacargin (**2**) and dictamine (**6**) from HSCCC fraction 4, 6 and 7-8 (respectively) were rather time consuming. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel and compound **1** was obtained with more working time (12 h). Fractions 6 and 7-8 were applied to Sephadex LH-20 ant took less working time (4 h). The present LC-APCII-MS/MS method was successfully applied to the quantification of all six compounds from the crude extracts, and permitted to determine the recovery of compounds **1-6** in HSCCC analyses, which were excellent. The present study proved that HSCCC is a powerful technique for the isolation in one-step of compounds **3-5** from plant crude extracts for bioactivity studies.\n\nThe biological result indicated that the compound tested was active at concentrations in the micromolar range, while the controls chloroquine (IC50 3.0 nM, _P. falciparum_) and pentamidine (IC50 35 nM, _T. brucei_) were active in the nanomolar range under the same test conditions. However, if it is assumed that the IC50 required for continued investigation is <30 mM, the IC50 of compound **3** is meaningful.\n\nChemical transformation of the limonoid guyanin (**1**, 40 mg) and alkaloid rutacargin (**2**, 110 mg) is in progress and perhaps could improve their antibacterial activity against _X. fastidiosa_.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES), for the financial support.\n\n## References\n\n* (1) P.G.

The gingerols purification was carried out in HPLC system using a Luna-C18 and the best mobile phase evaluated was MeOH/H2O (75:25, v/v). This new methodology for the gingerols isolation was very effective, since considerable amounts (in the range of milligrams) with a good purity degree (~98%) were achieved in 30 min of chromatographic run. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol purified by this methodology inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of \\(666.2\\pm 134.6\\) uM, \\(135.6\\pm 22.6\\) uM and \\(12.1\\pm 0.3\\) uM, respectively. These substances also inhibited human fibroblasts (HF) cell proliferation, however in concentrations starting from 500 uM. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an optimization of gingerols isolation and their specific anti-proliferative activities against tumor cells, suggesting their use as important models for drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSeveral population-based studies indicate that people in Asian countries have a much lower risk of different cancer types such as colon, gastrointestinal, prostate and breast, when compared to their Western counterparts. It is widely claimed that constituents of their diet such as ginger, garlic, soy, curcumin, onion, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, chillies, and green tea contribute to that lower incidence [1]. Therefore, there is increasing interest in naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive agents.\n\nGinger (_Zingiber officinale_foccinekosce) is widely used worldwide as a food, space and herb [2], Together with [6]-gingerol, [8]- and [10]-gingerol are the major pungent constituents in the ginger oleoresin from fresh rhizome, being [6]-gingerol the most abundant. Gingerols comprise a series of homologue substances differentiated by the length of their alkyl chains with [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol having 10, 12 and 14 carbons in their unbranched alkyl chains, respectively [3].\n\nRegarding [6]-gingerol a variety of pharmacological characteristics was already described, including analgesic, antipyretic, cardiotonic, hypothermia inducing and cancer preventing effects [4, 5, 6]. However, the effects on tumor cell proliferation for [8]- and [10]-gingerol are still scarce.\n\nBreast cancer is the third most frequent cancer in the world and one of the most common malignant diseases in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the second highest cause of death in women after cervical cancer [7]. To treat breast and many other cancer types, chemotherapy is one of the most extensively studied methods. However, its efficacy and safety remain a primary concern as well as its toxicity and other side effects [8, 9]. Another reason for concern regarding this method is the development of chemotherapy resistance, which is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of many tumor types, including breast cancer [8]. Tumor cells are found to adopt multiple mechanisms to resist drugs, such as decreased uptake, and/or enhanced efflux and altered drug \n\n## Page 2\n\nmetabolism. Alteration in drug targets, activation of detoxification systems, enhanced DNA repair ability, and inhibition of apoptosis are also cancer cell strategies to resist against chemotherapy drugs [10].\n\nMany anticancer therapies can temporarily stop tumor growth; it means that, in most cases, the effect is not permanent. In this way, there is a significant need for new agents with low susceptibility to common drug resistance mechanisms in order to improve response rates and potentially prolong patient's survival. Approximately 30% of the women diagnosed with early-stage disease progress to metastatic breast cancer. To these women, therapeutic options are still limited. Current recommendations for first-line chemotherapy include anthracycline-based and taxanes treatments (paclitaxel and docetaxel) [8]. Taxanes - which are taxol derivatives that were first described as microtubule stabilizing agents [11] and then had their antineoplastic effects confirmed [12,13] - are the first example of natural product derivatives used in antitumor therapy. Therefore, the search for new natural products that may be used as an additional alternative to the chemotherapy in an attempt to develop more effective drugs with fewer side effects is of great interest [14]. Based on this assumption it is important to develop an effective method for the isolation of these compounds.\n\nThe aim of this work was to search a faster, efficient and productive procedure for isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol by reverse phase HPLC operating under overloading conditions and to test their anti-proliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumor line and normal human fibroblasts (HF), a non tumor cell line. The results presented in this study showed a more specific anti-proliferative activity for [8]- and [10]-gingerol against breast cancer compared to HF and suggest their use as important models for anti-cancer therapy in an attempt to develop new drugs with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Chemicals\n\n[6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol were isolated from the ethanol extract of the ginger rhizome (purchased locally) by liquid chromatography. The structures were elucidated by 1H NMR using a Bruker DRX200 instrument (Bruker, USA), operating at 200 MHz for 1H spectra, with TMS as internal standard, GC-MS on a Shimadzu QP 5000 and comparison with literature data. The purity was determined by elemental analysis on an EA 1108, CHMS-O (Fisons). HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from JTBaker Company (Netherland). Water was deionised. All other analytical grade reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n### [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation\n\nThe fresh ginger rhizome was thin sliced, dried at 40 degC and ground to powder. The powder was extracted with ethanol for 72 h, three times. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 degC. The extraction of ginger (0.4 kg dry weight) yielded 21.2 g of crude extract (5.3%). The extract was stored at -4 degC for the later fractionation.\n\nIn order to isolate [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, dry ginger rhizome crude ethanol extract was chromatographed on SiO2 (70-230 mesh) column with bed height 20 cm (20 cm x 8 cm i.d.), using initially _n_-hexane (1 L), to eliminate the lipids. After, _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate 50:50 (v/v, 2.5 L) was used as eluent resulting in 5 fractions (A1-5), where the fractions A1, A2, A3 and A4 (68.8%, 14.6 g), rich in [6]- and [10]-gingerols, were joined resulting in the fraction A1-4. Part of this fraction (5.5 g) was re-chromatographed on SiO2 column (28 cm x 5 cm i.d.) using _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate 60:40 (v/v, 2.4 L). Forty eight fractions (50 mL each) were collected and combined after monitoring by TLC resulting in six sub-fractions with the following volumes: 250 mL (B1), 400 mL(B2), 150 mL(B3), 800 mL(B4), 200 mL(B5) and 600 mL (B6). The gingerols were the main constituent on the fraction B4 (800 mL, 2.8 g, yellow oil).\n\nAnalytical and semi-preparative HPLC were carried out using a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP system with an SPD-10AVP UV-vis detector with a flow cell analytical or flow cell preparative, according with the HPLC mode (analytical or semi-preparative), and a Shimadzu LC-6AD pump. The isolation optimization was carried out on a Lura-C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., 10 mm, homemade, UFSCar, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil) and the column was maintained at 25 degC, the detection wavelength was set at 282 nm and the flow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phases consisted of isocratic binary mixtures (v/v) of MeOH/H2O (80:20; 75:25; 70:30) and ACN/H2O (67:33). Forty microliters of methanol containing 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of B4 sample were injected. In the column scale-up reverse phase semi-preparative, a Luna-C18 column (300 mm x 10 mm i.d., 10 mm, homemade, UFSCar, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil) was used. This column was maintained at 25 degC, the detection wavelength was set at 254 nm (lower absorbance wavelength for the gingerols) and the flow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The best mobile phase was MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v) and the scale-up factor was calculated using Eq. (1) below, where \\(S\\), \\(R\\), \\(L\\), \\(P\\), \\(A\\) are scale-up factor, column radius, column length, semi-preparative and analytical columns, respectively. The maximum amount of fraction B4 injected in the semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg diluted to final volume of 400 mL.\n\n\\[S = \\frac{R_{\\text{P}}^{2}\\text{xL}_{\\text{H}}}{R_{\\text{A}}^{2}\\text{xL}_{\\text{H}}}\\]\n\n### Cell line and culture\n\nMDA-MB-231 human breast tumor and HF cell lines, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), were maintained at 37 degC in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cutilab - Campinas; SP, Brazil) containing 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum), penicillin (100 UI/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and L-glutamine (2 mM). Cell cultures and experiments were conducted in a humidified environment with 5% CO2 at 37 degC.\n\n### Proliferation assays\n\nCell lines were prepared at a concentration of 5 x 104 cells/200 mL, in appropriate medium with 10% of FBS, and plated on sterile 96-well plates for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14-18 h at 37 degC and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, known as starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation, the culture medium was removed from the wells and a new one, supplemented with 10% of FBS, containing different concentrations of the tested compounds was added to the wells. The cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h under the same conditions as described above. Cell proliferation assay was performed in comparison to the wells where the vehicle compound (2.5% DMSO) was added instead of the tested compounds. After incubation, the culture medium of each well was removed and a solution containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added (100 mL/well). The plates were then kept at 37 degC for 4 h and the formed crystals were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. The absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 595 nm. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control for inhibition of cell proliferation [15].\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nEach experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and a standard error mean was calculated. Shapiro-Wilk's \\(W\\) test was used to verify data normality. As normal distribution was present, the results were compared statistically with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Since the ANOVA tests showed significant differences (acceptable \\(P\\) level < 0.05). Bonferroni's significant difference _post_ hoc analyses were performed to determine differences between simple and grouped main-effect means, respectively. The data were analyzed by using Statistica software (version 8.0; Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, USA) and IC50 calculations were made using Hill's equation in the Origin software (version 8.5; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA).\n\n## Results\n\n### [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation\n\nFour different conditions were carried out on analytical C18 column HPLC to achieve the best separation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol. The best separation condition was achieved using MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v), where a good separation of three gingerols in a single run of 30 min was obtained (Fig. 1).\n\nThe injection volume (400 mL) was larger than the usual size of an injection volume and also it was not the one that was calculated by the scale up formula. This occurred because of the sample viscosity, which would be very high if 170.1 mg were diluted in 230 mL (calculated volume) that would impair the chromatographic separation. For column overloading with the sample, increasing amounts of fraction B4 (0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg diluted to final volume 40 mL) were injected in a C18 analytical column. Using the detector at 282 nm electronic saturation was observed when 5 mg of sample was injected, although the peaks were still visible for isolation of gingerols until 15 mg. With the injection of 30 mg of sample, the electronic saturation hindered the visualization of peaks closer to peak 1 (Fig. 2). To solve this problem, on the semi-preparative mode, the detector was set at 254 nm and in this condition it was possible to identify the three gingerols present in the fraction.\n\nUsing Eq. (1) for the determination of scale-up factor, the value 5.67 was obtained, consequently the maximum amount of B4 fraction that could be injected in a semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg (Fig. 3). However, to make the adjustment of the flow rate easier we decided to use 6.0 mL/min instead of 5.67 mL/min, and by working in this condition the results obtained were satisfactory.\n\nThe mass of each gingerol obtained from 170.1 mg of fraction B4 was: 94 mg ([6]-gingerol), 22 mg ([8]-gingerol) and 17 mg ([10]-gingerol). The purity of gingerols was calculated based on the elemental analysis of each gingerol. The purification yields based on the fresh ginger weight were 1027, 241 and 187 ppm for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. The purity obtained was 94.4, 99 and 97.3% for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively.\n\nFig. 1: Chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]-gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d. 10 μm) column maintained at 25° C with MeOH/H2O 80:20; MeOH/H2O 75:25, ACh/H2O 67:23 and MeOH/H2O 70:30, UV detection at 282 nm and flow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 40 μM.\n\nFig. 2: Overload chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]-gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C58 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d. 10 μm) column maintained at 25° C with MeOH/H2O 75:25, UV detection at 282 nm and flow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injected masses were 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. The injection volume was 40 μM.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n### Identification of [6], [8] and [10]-gingerol\n\nThe gingerols were identified based on the 1H NMR and MS spectra data compared with literature [16,17].\n\n#### 3.2.1 [6]-Gingerol\n\nVellow oil; C17H26O4.

The same pattern was observed after 48 h of [10]-gingerol incubation; there was a cell proliferation inhibition of about 90% (Fig. 4A).\n\nHF were used in order to compare the effects of both [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in a non tumor cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). No significant differences in MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation using 1, 10, 50 and 100 \\(\\mu\\)M for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in 24 or 48 h of incubation were verified.

These compounds were more effective in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (MDA-MB-231) when compared to normal cell proliferation (HF). The IC50 values for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation were calculated. The results showed that these compounds inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 \\(\\pm\\) 134.6 \\(\\mu\\)M; 135.6 \\(\\pm\\) 22.6 \\(\\mu\\)M and 12.1 \\(\\pm\\) 0.3 \\(\\mu\\)M, respectively. These substances also inhibit HF cell proliferation, nevertheless, we were not able to calculate the IC50 values for this cell line, since the initial concentration that had an effect was 500 \\(\\mu\\)M for [6]-, [8] and [10]-gingerol.\n\n## Discussion\n\nStudies of isolation and purification of gingerols are scarce in the literature. Considering the interesting biological activities and the potential of these compounds to the medical area it is imperative to develop new methodologies to achieve an optimization of gingerol separation and purification. The isolation of gingerols ([6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol) described in this work was achieved satisfactorily, once it was possible to obtain relatively high mass and a good degree of gingerols purity. To our knowledge, only one work about isolation of gingerols using HPLC system was published [18]. In this work, the authors isolated the major gingerols from the crude dichloromethane extract of ginger rhizome by normal phase HPLC. A low purity degree (calculated by the percentage of peak area) for both, [8]-gingerol (86%) and [10]-gingerol (84%) was achieved, while for the [6]-gingerol the purity was 99%. The purity degree obtained for each gingerol does not represent the real one, because HPLC system using UV detection does not guarantee the absence of other components in the sample. In a recent work, the isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol was carried out using counter-current chromatography (CCC). In this study gingerols were obtained with high purity degree (99%), however the time of chromatographic run was very length (240 min) [19]. In another work regarding isolation of gingerols from crude extract of ginger rhizome using CCC the time of chromatographic run was again very extensive, and the purity was about 98% [20].\n\nElectronic saturation is a factor that considerable limits the increasing of injected mass in the semi-preparative scale. In our work, this factor had limited injections of samples with higher masses, even at a wavelength of low absorption of gingerols (254 nm) (Fig. 3). However, the gingerols were isolated in significant quantities and with a good purity degree. To avoid the electronic saturation we could use either a less sensitive flow cell or make the adjustment of the wavelength well off the lambda max. We have not tried a less sensitive cell, however all the experiment conditions were tested in the lower absorption wavelength for the gingerols, and we still obtained electronic saturation. It may be possible to use other detectors even though we have only used UV.\n\nThe effects of [6]-gingerol on tumor cell proliferation are already well documented [5, 21, 22, 23], however, the effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on tumor cells are still scarce. In fact, among all the ginger constituents, much more attention has been given to [6]-gingerol in order to explore its pharmacological properties and action mechanisms. In this sense, besides [6]-gingerol effects, those of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on _in vitro_ tumor cell proliferation using MDA-MB-231 and HF cell lines were also investigated.\n\nThe overall results suggest that the higher the alkyl chain, the greater the effectiveness of gingerol in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, probably due to the manner in which these substances enter the cells through their plasma membrane. In general, with increasing alkyl chain lengths, there is an increase in lipophilic character (log _P_) of compounds, and this can be quantified by the partition coefficient (_P_) in an n-octanol/water system. It is also known that the higher the log \\(P\\) value, to a certain extent, the higher will be the permeation in biological membranes [24, 25]. This can be extended to compounds such as gingerols, which represent a homologous series of substances.\n\nSimilar effects of gingerols and other ginger-derived substances were already described in the literature. Tjendraputra et al. [26] demonstrated that the inhibition of COX-2 by ginger constituents and synthetic analogs was structure-dependent. The lipophilicity and the functional group substitution on the alkyl side chain, as well as the aromatic moiety were the main aspects influencing COX-2 inhibition. Similar correlations between the side-chain length of gingerols and their activities of apoptosis induction and neuronal cells protection from b-amyloid insult have already been demonstrated [27, 28].\n\nThe cytotoxic effect of [8]- and [10]-gingerol has been investigated by a few authors [27, 29]. Kim and coworkers [29] have tested the effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol in a variety of human tumor cells lines including A-549 (lung cancer), SK-OV-3 (ovarian cancer), SK-MEL-2 (skin cancer) and HCT15 (colon cancer). They found an IC50 ranging from approximately 4.52 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL (13 \\(\\mu\\)M) to 12.57 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL (40 \\(\\mu\\)M), with [10]-gingerol being more effective than [8]-gingerol in decreasing the viability of these tumor cell lines [29]. Wei and coworkers [27] found an IC50 of 87.9 \\(\\pm\\) 3.5 \\(\\mu\\)M and 56.5 \\(\\pm\\) 6.0 \\(\\mu\\)M for [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively, in the inhibition of HL-60 proliferation, a human leukemia tumor cell line. These data are in accordance with the findings in this work on MDA-MB-231 cells, revealing the same activity dependence on the chain length size pattern.\n\nKuo and collaborators [30] working with SW480 cells, a lineage of colorectal cancer, observed that [10]-gingerol caused a significant concentration-dependent and sustained [Ca\\({}^{2+}\\)]i rise, suggesting that this elevation can alter cellular functions, leading to cell death. They found a cytotoxic effect of [10]-gingerol 50, 75 and 100 \\(\\mu\\)M [30]. It is important to notice that the methodology in the present study was different, even though, similar effects were found in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line.\n\nOur findings demonstrate a specificity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on the inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation when compared to non tumor human fibroblast cell line. The findings of other authors corroborate with our results. Kazi et al. [31] described the effects of antibiotics derived from b-lactam, lactam 1 and 12 on normal and tumor cells. They show that lactam 1 selectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat T, but not in the non transformed, immortalized human natural killer cells. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that lactam 12 induces apoptosis selectively in Jurkat T and simian virus 40-transformed, but not in non transformed NK and parental normal fibroblast cells. The authors propose that these N-tholated b-lactams act by inducing DNA damage that leads to apoptosis preferentially in cancer and transformed over normal/non transformed cells. Another example includes pancratistatin, a natural compound isolated from the \n\n## Page 6\n\nspider lily, which is an efficient inducer of apoptosis in human lymphoma (Jurkat) cells, with minimal effect on normal nucleated blood cells. The authors discuss that this selective effect could be due to the expression of the Fas receptors, which are found to be greater in blood lymphoma cells than normal blood cells. Furthermore, in fast-dividing cancer cells, the plasma membrane tends to run short of lipids, perhaps changing the fluidity of the membrane [32]. Ovadje et al. [33] demonstrate that dandelion root extract is capable of inducing apoptosis at low concentrations specifically in cancer cells with no toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, Mathen et al. [34] working with extracts from _Calotropis gigamate_, the giant milkweed, traditionally used for the treatment of cancer and in Ayuravledi medicine and _Poecilocerus pictus_, an orthopteran insect, which feeds on _C. gigantea_, demonstrated that both the insect and the plant extracts induce concentration-dependent apoptosis and differentiate between human cancer cells and normal cells and exhibit species specificity.\n\nThe chemopreventive mechanisms of singereols are not well understood however, are thought to involve proapoptotic [27, 35, 36, 37], antioxidant [38], anti-inflammatory [6, 39, 40, 41], and anti-angiogenic [42] activities. Further investigation will be done in order to determine the mechanisms by which [8]- and [10]-gingerol act inhibiting with more specificity the MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this work presents a new methodology for the isolation of singereols, which proved to be effective, once considerable amounts with a good purity degree in a relatively short time of chromatographic run were achieved from these important bioactive compounds, mainly [8]-gingerol (99%) and [10]-gingerol (97.3%). This is the first report on the separation of these compounds with such a purity degree using HPLC semi-preparative scale. Optimizations in the separation process regarding column overloading can still be made so that the electron saturation be not reached, which can be achieved by using other less sensitive detectors. The singereols isolated through this methodology, demonstrate an anti-proliferative activity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol specifically on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells when compared to HF normal cells. As far as we know, this is the first report regarding a specific cell effect of ginger derivatives. The results also suggest the use of [8]- and [10]-gingerol as important models for anti-cancer therapy and drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## References\n\n* (1) T.

(Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a familiar Brazilian species popularly known as Taruma whose leaf tea has been used by population to treat kidney diseases. The aim of this research was to investigate the hydroalcoholic extract of leaves in order to isolate the active compounds. Hydroalcoholic extract of leaves was obtained by stirring the previous hexane and methanol extracted leaves residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing. The obtained extract was partitioned with _n_-butanol. The yielded fraction was subsequently submitted to several chromatographic procedures to lead to the isolation of _O_-glycosidicflavones orientin and isoorientin as well as _C_-glycosylflavones schafoside and carlinoside along with their isomers, known as potent anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antioxidant agents, then identified as the active constituents, justifying the folk use of the plant to combat and prevent kidney stone and inflammation.\n\nkeywords: _Vitex polygamma_; Verbenaceae; Lamiaceae; Kidney diseases; _C_-glycosylflavones; _O_-glycosylflavones +\nFootnote †: journal:\n\n## 1 Plant\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, according to Cantino et al., 1992; formerly Verbenaceae, in keeping with Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the States of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957). The plant was collected in July 2000, in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and authenticated by Dr. Fatima Regina Salimena-Pires, a taxonomic botanist from Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras da Universidade de Sao Paulo, _campus_ Ribeirao Preto (SPFR), Brazil, under the acquisition number 9968.\n\n## 2 Use in traditional medicine\n\nThe leaf tea is used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat and prevent kidney stone and inflammation (Rodrigues, 2001).\n\n## 3 Previously isolated classes of constituents\n\nIn preceding studies, _Vitex polygamma_ has been found to contain sesquiterpenes, fatty acids (Barbosa et al., 1995), 2''_O_-caffeoylorientin besides other common flavones simultaneously with some _O_-glycosylated derivatives, flavonols, phenolic acids (Leitao and Delle Monache, 1998), several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the essential oil (Leitao et al., 1999), phytosteroids, caffeoylesters from quinic acid (Santos, 2000), and ecdysteroids (Santos et al., 2001).\n\n## 4 Materials and methods\n\nThe powder of the air-dried leaves (423.0 g) was extracted successively with hexane and methanol (MeOH) through percolation process at room temperature. Hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing for 10 min (3\\(\\times\\) 300 mL).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nThe resulting filtrates were subsequently combined, evaporated _in vacuum_ (40 degC) and lyophilized. Afterward, the extract (31 g, 31%, w/w of the dry leaves weight (DLW)) was dissolved in distilled water and fractionated through liquid-liquid partition using ethyl acetate (EA) and _n_-BuOH (BU) (5\\(\\times\\) 300 mL each) to yield EA (2.2 g, 2.2%, w/w DLW) and BU (10.7 g, 10.7%, w/w DLW) fractions, respectively. BU fraction was subjected to CC using XAD7 (46.0 cm x 4.0 cm) and subsequent elution with 500 mL of water (WV), water/MeOH 1:1 (WMV) and 2 L of MeOH (MV). One gram of the dried fraction MV (6.75 g, 6.75%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (53.0 cm x 3.0 cm) using MeOH as eluent resulting in 41 fractions of 30 mL, which were pooled into seven fractions (MV1 to MV7). Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg, 1.13%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with MeOH. Twenty-three fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg, 0.39% w/w DLW) was further purified by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase MeOH, flow-rate 3 mL min\\({}^{-1}\\); \\(\\lambda\\) 330 nm) to yield compounds **1** and **2** (5.5 mg, 0.04%, w/w DLW), substances **3** and **4** (3.1 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) after three cycles of 54 min. Fraction 5 (MV5, 293.1 mg, 1.98%, w/w DLW) was submitted to the same R-HPLC system to yield compounds **5** and **6** (20.5 mg, 0.14%, w/w DLW) as mixture, and compounds **7** and **8** (3.0 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) also as mixture. Fraction WV, after recrystallization in 90% aqueous MeOH solution, afforded substance **9** (280.0 mg).\n\n## Results\n\nFrom _n_-BuOH partition of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves from _Vitex polygamma_ were isolated the compounds caffeoyl 6-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside (**1**), caffeoyl 6-_O_-a-d-d-glucopyranoside (**2**), schafoside (**3**), isoschafoside (**4**), orientin (**5**), isoorientin (**6**), carlinoside (**7**), isocarlinoside (**8**) and metacrylic acid (**9**) whose chemical structures (Fig. 1) were identified by means of \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR as well as HMBC, HSQC and negative ESI/MS spectra data which were in accordance with previously reported data (Kitagawa, 1984; Besson et al., 1985; Dayrit et al., 1987; Shimomura et al., 1988). Schafoside and its isomer is known for its efficacy as anti-inflammatory (Melo et al., 2005) and preventive effect against kidney stone in rats, as evaluated by urine output, excretion of Ca, citric acid, and creatinine analysis (Kubo et al., 1989). Moreover the _C_-glycosidic flavones **3**, **4**, **7** and **8** are being reported for the first time in the genus _Vitex_.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to ALCOA S.A. for facilitating the plant collection.\n\nFigure 1: Chemical structures of compounds isolated from _Vitex polygamma_ _n_-butanoic extract.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThis study has been supported by Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ).\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Barbosa, L.C.A., Demuner, A.J., Howarth, O.W., Pereira, N.S., Veloso, D.P., 1995.

Zanoni\n\nboldrinv@iq.unesp.br Instituto de Quimica-UNESP, Universidade Estadual Paulista, CP 355-CEP, 14801-970 Araraquara SP, Brazil\n\nReceived 11 December 2002; received in revised form 20 August 2003; accepted 29 September 2003\n\n###### Abstract\n\nThe electrochemical oxidation of caffeic, chlorogenic, sinapic, ferulic and _p_-coumaric acids was investigated by cyclic voltammetry on acetate buffer pH 5.6 on glassy carbon electrode and modified glassy carbon electrode. According to their voltammetric behavior, the antioxidant activity of these phenolic acids was evaluated and the results pointed to the following sequence: caffeic acid (\\(E_{\\text{a}}=+0.31\\,\\text{V}\\)) > chlorogenic acid (\\(+0.38\\,\\text{V}\\)) > sinapic acid (\\(+0.45\\,\\text{V}\\)) > ferulic acid (\\(+0.53\\,\\text{V}\\)) > _p_-coumaric acid (\\(+0.73\\,\\text{V}\\)). The results were confirmed by DPPH test, which evidenced the strongest antiradical activity for compounds possessing the cathecol moiety (caffeic and chlorogenic acids). Linear calibration graphs were obtained for their determination at concentrations from \\(1\\times 10^{-4}\\) to \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\). The method was applied to orange juice. Selectivity was illustrated by the analysis of caffeic and chlorogenic acids electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode previously modified by electrochemical activation in the presence of ascorbic acid.\n\nkeywords: Phenolic antioxidants; Voltammetric methods; Electrochemical oxidation; Orange juice +\nFootnote †: journal: Journal of Food Composition and Analysis\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nDietary recommendations for healthy eating include the consumption of fruit juices (Williams, 1995) whose beneficial health effects are mostly ascribed to natural antioxidants. Although the majority of the evidence emphasizes the roles of vitamin E, vitamin C and \\(\\beta\\)-carotene, recent studies have highlighted the importance of the phenolic antioxidants in the total antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nCitrus phenolics represent a varied and widely studied class of compounds (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The phenolic substances of importance in orange can be classified into two groups: phenolic acids and related compounds and flavonoids. The most important phenolic acid in orange juice is cinnamic acid and its derivatives: ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The relative contribution of phenolic derivatives to the antioxidant potential is associated with their effectiveness as hydrogen donors, which is dependent on the number and arrangement of the hydroxyl groups and the extent of structural conjugation, as well as the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring (Rice-Evans et al., 2000; Miller et al., 1993; Clegg and Morton, 1968). The antiradical ability of organic compounds may be assessed by measuring the ease of their reaction with the stable free radical diphenylpycrylhydrazyl (DPPH _l_max 517 nm), leading to its reduced form (DPPH-H). Good free radical scavengers react fast leaving small amounts of unreduced DPPH, which indicates the presence of an effective antioxidant (Bonded et al., 1997).\n\nIn addition to their antioxidant capacity, fruit phenolics have been the subject of increased interest in the last few years because their presence can contribute to the sensory quality of the fruit and juice through their effect on color, bitterness, astringency and flavor. Therefore, different analytical methods are required for their quantification (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Cordella et al., 2002). Phenolic substances have characteristic ultraviolet spectra, which have been used to detect adulteration in orange juice by spectrophotometric techniques (Escarpa and Gonzalez, 2001; Frenzel and Krekler, 1995). These procedures have been replaced by chromatographic procedures, which provide more detailed information on samples containing several organic compounds (Escarpa and Gonzalez, 2001; Bocchi et al., 1996). For example, analytical procedures for ferulic acid have been based on gas chromatography with flame ionization or electron-capture detection following derivatization. HPLC methods for these phenolic compounds in orange juice have been used involving derivatization and/or solid-phase extraction coupled with UV, photodiode-array and fluorescence detection (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Bocchi et al., 1996; Moskvin et al., 1999; Karovicova and Simko, 2000; Miller and Rice-Evans 1997; Christofersen and Cardwell, 1996). Alternatively, serial coulometric detection of phenolic compounds has been used to generate multivariate data for differentiation of juices (Peyrat-Maillard et al., 2000).\n\nThe use of cyclic voltammetry as an instrumental tool for the evaluation of the total antioxidant capacity of the low-molecular-weight antioxidants (LMWAs) in both fluids (Chevion et al., 2000) and edible plants (Chevion et al., 1999) is well known. A cyclic voltammogram provides information describing the integrated antioxidant capacity, which arises in large part from the ability of the compound to donate electrons around the potential of the anodic wave. Most of the LMWAs are reducing agents, which quench reactive oxygen species through electron donation (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1985). Therefore, evaluation of the overall reducing power by cyclic voltammetry reflects the antioxidant activity of pure compounds as well as that of mixture of compounds. Most of the studies involving LMWA reports ascorbic acid as a major component in the cyclic voltammetry response identified by measure of anodic peak around \\(+\\) 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl/Cl\\({}^{-}\\) (Yu et al., 1996).\n\nGlassy carbon is the electrode material used extensively in electrochemistry for analysis of electroactive substances and as the basis for surface-modified electrodes. The electrochemical properties of this material can be improved by surface treatment (Bard and Faulkner, 1980).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nElectrochemical activation of the glassy carbon electrode through oxidation and reduction of the electrode surface is a widely used method to change its characteristics. Many authors (Zhang et al., 1996; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Golabi and Zare, 1999; Moreno et al., 2000) have demonstrated that this procedure can improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the electroanalytical method application. For instance, the electrode can present a good performance for catalysis and/or applications as electrochemical detectors for significant types of analytes due to selective chemical or physical interaction between specific functional groups generated on its surface and selective species in solution.\n\nIn spite of the high sensitivity and selectivity of electroanalytical methods and the great importance of phenolic acids in orange juice, few studies have been conducted on the application of this technique for their determination. So, the aim of the present work was to investigate the electrochemical behavior of cinnamic acid and its derivatives (Fig. 1) on glassy carbon electrode. In addition, the possibility of using electroactivated glassy carbon electrode for oxidation of ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was studied for their selective determination in orange juice without interference of ascorbic acid. In order to confirm the effectiveness of these phenolic acids as free radical scavengers and to correlate this activity with the electrochemical behavior, a spectrophotometric test using DPPH as a substrate was also undertaken.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Apparatus and procedures\n\nThe electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Metrohm Polarecord E 506 linked to a compatible microcomputer through a Microquimica interface. The multimode electrode\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structures of (a) cinnamic acid, (b) caffeic acid (c) chlorogenic acid, (d) _p_-coumaric acid, (e) ferulic acid and (f) sinapic acid.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nMetrohm stand 663 VA was used and a glassy carbon disc (0.02 cm\\({}^{2}\\)) from Metrohm was used as the working electrode. A carbon auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl/Cl\\({}^{-}\\) (3.0 mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrode modification was based on the following procedure described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999). The glassy carbon electrode surface was polished with 0.05 um alumina suspension and rinsed with water. The electrode was immersed in 0.1 mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) sodium bicarbonate and submitted to continuous potential cycling from \\(-\\)1.3 to +1.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\) for 5 min. The activated electrodes were rinsed and placed in a solution containing 1 x 10\\({}^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) of the phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6. The deposition was carried out by dipping and by cycling the potential from 0.1 to +0.8 V at 50 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\) during a controlled time of 5 min. After both these processes, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with water and immersed in a solution containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The modified electrode exhibited a well-shaped cyclic voltammogram corresponding to the reversible oxidation of surface deposited only for caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid and stable current values were obtained only for the cycling method used for the deposition of diphenol compounds.\n\nSuprapur grade reagents supplied by Merck and demineralized water from a Milli-Q system (Milli-pore) were used in the preparation of all solutions. Acetate buffer used as a supporting electrolyte was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0.2 mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) acetic acid and sodium acetate solution. Ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic, chlorogenic and ascorbic acid stock solutions (1 x 10\\({}^{-2}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)) were prepared from the dry pure substances in water. An aliquot of the standard solution to be investigated was added by micropipette to 20 mL of deaerated acetate buffer pH 5.6, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAnalyses of caffeic acid and chlorogenic compounds in orange juice were carried out using three representative samples of natural juice commercialized in Brazil as Danone(r), Jussy(r) and Batavo(r). For comparison reasons, all samples examined were recently produced and stored at 10\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in obscurity and analyzed shortly after opening. An aliquot of 600 mL of the orange juice (without any previous dilution or extraction) was transferred directly into the voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The previous activated electrode was immersed in this solution and seven uninterrupted voltammetric curves were recorded between +0.1 and +0.8 V at 50 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\) when stable curves were obtained. Finally, the cyclic voltammograms were carried out after a step where the electrode was rinsed and placed in a voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The mean values of peak currents were obtained and the acids composition determined after standard addition method, when 1 x 10\\({}^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) of caffeic acid solution was added to the original sample and submitted to the deposition step, after which the voltammograms were recorded as shown above. All measurements were analyzed in triplicates.\n\n### Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH)\n\nThe free radical scavenging capacity of ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was also estimated from its ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 x 10\\({}^{-6}\\) to 1 x 10\\({}^{-4}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and _p_-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each \n\n## Page 5\n\nphenolic acid to reduce the absorbance of DPPH solution at 517 nm, followed on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer (Brand-Williams et al., 1995).\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\n### Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at a glassy carbon electrode\n\nCinnamic acid and its derivatives, ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic, contain reducible olefinic bond or oxidizible phenolic substituents on the aromatic ring that could provide the basis for their voltammetric determination. Nevertheless, only differential pulse voltammograms of 1 x 10-3 mol L-1 of cinnamic acid exhibit one cathodic peak in the pH range 3-7 at very negative potential (-1.5 V). The process is attributed to the reduction of the pre-protonated ethylene bond conjugated (H+[C6H5-CH]=CH-COOH) after two-electron transfer, as verified previously by polarographic studies (Ferreira et al., 1996). The inductive effects from _ortho_ and/or _para_ hydroxyl groups to the double bond, which is conjugated with the aromatic ring in the derivatives ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, make the molecule more difficult to reduce. Therefore, the cyclic voltammograms do not exhibit any voltammetric waves for reduction of phenolic derivatives on the useful potential range, and the methods do not demonstrate any analytical potentiality for their determination using the reduction of the olefinic bond in these compounds.\n\nOn the other hand, typical cyclic voltammograms obtained for all phenolic derivatives are shown in Fig. 2. Except cinnamic acid, which is not oxidized, all the derivatives present well-defined waves, and the shape and the peak potentials are characteristic of each compound.\n\nThe anodic oxidation of 1.0 x 10-3 mol L-1 caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have shown only one anodic peak at _E_pa = +0.36 V and _E_pa = +0.38 V, respectively. Linear plots of peak current (ipa) as a function of \\(v\\)1/2 were obtained indicating that both oxidation processes are diffusion controlled (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). For both compounds, a cathodic peak is observed on the reverse scan. Epc-Epa values obtained from the cyclic voltammograms (_v_ = 20 mV s-1) are around 30 mV suggesting a process involving two electrons (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The ratio of the anodic-to-cathodic peak heights (ipc/ipa) increases gradually from 0.8 to 1 with increasing potential sweep rate from 10 to 100 mV s-1 and the calculated current functions (ipa \\(\\cdot\\) _v_-1/2) diminish gradually with the potential scan rate, showing the classical behavior of an oxidation process coupled with a slow subsequent chemical reaction.\n\nIn order to establish their analytical potentiality, quantitative tests were developed for caffeic and chlorogenic acids using their anodic peaks by linear voltammetric scan. At pH 5.6, the analytical curves are linear from 1 x 10-4 to 1 x 10-3 mol L-1 and are described by the following regression lines: ip (mA) = 0.08138 + 2.1472 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.9993, \\(n\\) = 7) for caffeic acid and: ip (mA) = 0.05321 + 1.9571 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.995, \\(n\\) = 6 for chlorogenic acid. The reproducibility of the response was tested using a series of standard solutions of 5 x 10-4 mol L-1 caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Relative standard deviations of 2.4% and 2.8% were obtained, respectively.\n\nThe cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1.0 x 10-3 mol L-1 sinapic, ferulic and coumaric acids in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have also shown one anodic peak at _E_pa = +0.45 V, _E_pa = +0.53 V and \n\n## Page 6\n\n\\(E_{\\rm pa}=+0.73\\) V, respectively. The influence of scan rate on the cyclic voltammetric parameters was investigated from 0.01 to 3 V s\\({}^{-1}\\). The anodic peak appears to correspond to an irreversible process, as no current is observed in the reverse scan. The peak current is proportional to \\(v^{1/2}\\), indicating that the process is diffusion controlled. The current function decreased markedly up to a highest scan rate. These results suggest that the oxidation step is followed by an electron transfer coupled with a rapid chemical reaction (Bard and Faulkner, 1980).\n\nA linear relationship between peak current and sinapic acid and ferulic acid concentrations was obtained from \\(4\\times 10^{-4}\\) to \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) following the equation: ip (\\(\\mu\\)A) = \\(0.1302+0.602\\times 10^{3}\\) C (C = mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)); correlation coefficient 0.9089, \\(n=7\\) for sinapic acid and ip\n\nFigure 2: Cyclic voltammograms for the oxidation of \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) (buffer pH 5.6) of caffeic acid (a); sinapic acid (b); chlorogenic acid (c); ferulic acid (d); \\(p\\)-coumaric acid (e); and ascorbic acid (f) on glassy carbon electrode. Scan rate: 100 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n## Page 7\n\n(\\(\\mu\\)A) = 0.1034 + 0.837 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.9970, \\(n\\) = 7 for ferulic acid. A linear relationship was also obtained for coumaric acid from 4 x 10-5 to 1.2 x 10-3 mol L-1: ip (\\(\\mu\\)A) = 0.05705 + 1.0663 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.995, \\(n\\) = 7.\n\nIn agreement with the literature (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Baizer and Lund, 1972), the voltammetric behavior appears to agree with the global mechanism proposed for oxidation of phenol group in aromatic compounds (Baizer and Lund, 1972). The hydroxy groups are oxidized via two electrons transfer leading to the generation of a correspondent quinone after liberation of 2H+. The results have indicated that the higher the number of hydroxy substituents on the aromatic ring, the lower the electrochemical potential. Thus, _p_-coumaric acids (monophenols) have a higher potential than caffeic and chlorogenic acids (diphenyls). Such an order has already been defined by Peyrat-Maillard et al. (2000). In spite of the number of phenolic hydroxyls, the oxidation potential of caffeic and chlorogenic acids also presented a reversible redox couple that was not seen for the oxidation of the other phenolic compounds. The voltammetric behavior indicates that the oxidation process can involve the formation of a stable quinone which is reduced in the reverse scan, as observed in the oxidation of other phenolic compounds with the hydroxy group at the _ortho_ position (Baizer and Lund, 1972). In addition, the introduction of a quinic group on caffeic acid to give chlorogenic acid did not change the oxidation potential. However, the methoxylation of the phenolic groups (sinapic and ferulic acids) increases the peak potential and the rapid decomposition of the correspondent quinone makes the process appear to be an irreversible process since there is no reduction of quinone in the reverse scan.\n\nThe antioxidant activity of standard phenolic compounds is usually measured according to the method of Cuvelier et al. (1992) based on the accelerated autooxidation of methyl linoleate in anhydrous dodecane using strong oxidizing conditions or by spectrophotometric test measuring the antiradical capacity via reduction of the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (Brand-Williams et al., 1995) or by cyclic voltammetry (Chevion et al., 2000), in addition to several other available methods (Punchard, 1996).\n\nIn order to test the voltammetric results as a tool to evaluate the antioxidant capacity, the results were compared using the DPPH test (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and _p_-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each phenolic acid to reduce DPPH (see experimental section). Graphs of reduction of DDPH (%) as a function of different concentrations of phenolic compounds are shown in Fig. 3. The studied phenolic compounds showed free radical scavenging activity decreasing in the following sequence: caffeic acid > chlorogenic acid > sinapic acid > ferulic acid > coumaric acid. This behavior is attributed to the higher ability of diphenols to quench free radicals in solution by easier donation of hydrogen of hydroxy groups and to stabilize the respective radical forms due to electron delocalization.\n\nAs expected, the antioxidant or antiradical activity of most phenolic acids is inversely proportional to their oxidation potential. Diphenols (caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid) show high radical scavenging activities and low oxidation potentials when compared with other acids. Monophenols (_p_-coumaric acid) are less active and respond at a higher potential which is however smaller than those substituted by methoxy groups (sinapic and ferulic acids). In fact, the potential value is dependent upon the redox behavior of the compounds, reflecting their ability to lose electrons. The comparison is similar to that verified with DPPH measurement. Moreover, the \n\n## Page 8\n\nsignificant difference noticed for antioxidant activity for caffeic and chlorogenic acids is also confirmed by the shape of the voltammograms which indicates oxidation processes with reversible electron transfer.\n\nSo, the electrochemical oxidation could be used as a simple model to compare antioxidant activity based on the evaluation of the shape of the voltammogram and the oxidation potential.\n\n### Analysis of orange juice samples\n\nIn order to investigate the analytical potential of the electrochemical oxidation in determining phenolic derivatives in orange juice, cyclic voltammograms were recorded after a direct transfer of 100-3000 mL of natural orange juice samples to the voltammetric cell containing 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammogram, obtained as described in the experimental section, is shown in Fig. 4. A well-defined oxidation peak at \\(+\\) 0.38 V with 3.08 mA of anodic peak current (blank correction) is observed after transference of 600 mL of orange juice Danone(r), with peak heights proportional to the orange juice addition. Cyclic voltammograms recorded after standard addition of phenolic derivatives from \\(1\\times 10^{-4}\\) to \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) promote an extra peak at more positive values following the sequence: sinapic (70 mV), ferulic (150 mV) and _p_-coumaric (360 mV) acids indicating that they are probably not contributing significantly to the endogenous peak. Nevertheless, the standard addition of caffeic acid exhibited a concomitant increase in the peak current without any distortion of the peak potential. The same effect was observed with the standard addition of chlorogenic acid indicating that both contributions cannot be split.\n\nInterference of ascorbic acid was also tested under the same experimental conditions. Cyclic voltammograms obtained for \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) of ascorbic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 presents\n\nFig. 3: Free radical scavenging activity of phenolic acids towards DPPH after 30 min of chemical reaction: (a) caffeic acid, (b) chlorogenic acid, (c) sinapic acid, (d) ferulic acid and (e) _p_-coumaric acid. Measurements at \\(T=25^{\\circ}\\)C and \\(\\lambda=517\\) nm.\n\n\n\n## Page 9\n\nan irreversible oxidation peak at \\(\\,+\\,0.42\\,\\mathrm{V}\\), which was identified as potentially interfering in the analysis of phenolic compounds in orange juice, too. Similar results were obtained when the described method was applied to the determination of phenolic acids in commercial orange juice assigned as Batavo(r) and Jussy(r). The voltammograms obtained for \\(600\\,\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro L}\\) of orange juice in \\(10\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\) of acetate buffer pH 5.6 present oxidation peaks similar to those previously detected, with peak currents of \\(2.82\\pm 0.21\\) and \\(2.75\\pm 0.17\\,\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro A}\\) (values represent means of triplicate determinations), respectively. The peak height increases with standard addition of caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid or ascorbic acid, indicating value media of total phenolic compounds of \\(244.8\\pm 37\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) (\\(n=3\\)).\n\nSo, taking into consideration the fact that cyclic voltammetry could provide information about the total antioxidant capacity, without the specific determination of the contribution of each individual component, the method was tested using activated glassy carbon electrode.\n\n### Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at modified glassy carbon electrode\n\nAs described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997), glassy carbon electrode activated previously in bicarbonate solution can have its surface modified by active groups, where quinones, imidazoline groups and enzymes could be electrodeposited. Therefore, the analytical potentiality of the activated glassy carbon electrode obtained as described in the experimental section was investigated to determine phenolic compounds based on its interaction with the modified electrode.\n\nThe voltammetric response of glassy carbon electrode activated by continuous potential cycles from \\(-1.3\\) to \\(\\,+\\,1.6\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) at a sweep of \\(50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) (50 cycles) in sodium bicarbonate (\\(0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\)) solution does not exhibit any electroactive sites in the potential range from -0.4 to \\(\\,+\\,1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}\\). Two different deposition methods of phenolic compounds were employed. These methods involved dipping and cycling of the potential during the electrodeposition process.\n\n\n\n## Page 10\n\nIn the former method, the electrode was washed and transferred to a beaker containing \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6 solution. After carefully rinsing with water, the electrode was placed in a solution of \\(0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) acetate buffer previously purged with nitrogen. In the latter method, the activated electrode was rinsed and placed in a \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) solution of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6, where it was submitted to seven potential cyclings between \\(+\\,0.1\\) and \\(+\\,0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) (at \\(50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\)). The electrode was then removed to a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for both methods using caffeic acid were recorded at \\(100\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\). A redox couple of peaks at \\(+\\,0.33/+\\,0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) attributed to oxidation of phenol/quinone was observed for both methods, with characteristics close to those expected in a system involving surface process (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The voltammetric curves obtained using the cycling method present a higher peak intensity (Fig. 5). Successive scans (Curve n of Fig. 5) have shown constant values of current after the first scan indicating that the remaining material is quite persistent on the electrode surface. The results obtained using the dipping method have shown repetitive voltammograms with continuous decay during the continuous scanning of potential indicating that the material is released due to weak bound to the surface. So, the results obtained for both processes indicate that caffeic acid can be deposited on the electrode surface due to a weak interaction with the phenolic group (dipping) or strong interaction with quinone groups generated after successive oxidation (cycling). The most effective method was the electrodeposition of caffeic acid onto glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution using cycling potential and it was chosen as the best condition for analysis of the phenolic compounds.\n\nThe influence of cycling time from \\(+\\,0.1\\) to \\(+\\,0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) during accumulation of caffeic acid on the voltammetric response obtained for activated electrode was investigated immersing the previously\n\nFig. 5: Cyclic voltammograms obtained for oxidation of caffeic acid electrodeposited on glassy carbon modified electrode by electrochemical activation from \\(5\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) solution, rinsed and immersed in acetate buffer pH 5.6. \\(v=100\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\); (1) first scan, (n) multiple scan.\n\n\n\n## Page 11\n\nactivated electrode in \\(5\\times 10^{-4}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) caffeic acid and using cycling time from 50 s to 20 min. After a controlled time, the load electrode was removed to the voltammetric cell containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The current increased linearly up to 5 min of exposition, showing that the analyte is easily and rapidly accumulated on the electrode surface. At higher time, the current reaches a plateau indicating saturation of the electrode surface.\n\nIn order to assess the reproducibility of the electrode response, a series of 10 repetitive measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammograms (at 100 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\)) recorded for the activated electrode immersed in \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) caffeic acid solution and transported to a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The electrode response indicated a mean current peak value of \\(4.24\\pm 0.12\\) mA, where the coefficient of variation calculated was \\(4.3\\permille\\).\n\nUnder these experimental conditions, the calibration plots were tested immersing the coated electrode in caffeic acid solution containing \\(1\\times 10^{-4}-1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) using a controlled time of cycling of 5 min \n\n## Page 12\n\nacids. The cyclic voltammograms recorded after activated electrode transference to a voltammetric cell containing \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) of these phenolic compounds exhibit the expected behavior of that verified at bare electrode. But, when the electrode is rinsed and placed in a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6 there is no voltammetric signal, indicating that there is no remaining material on the activated electrode surface.\n\nThe electrodeposition mechanism of _o-_, _p_-quinones onto activated glassy carbon electrode has been described (Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997). The deposition of such compounds has been explained on the basis of a nucleophilic attack of quinones produced from the oxidation of phenolic compounds. When an activated glassy carbon electrode is used as a surface for electrooxidation of chlorogenic acid or caffeic acid, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the electrode act as nucleophiles against the _o_-quinone anodically formed. Such a process leads to bond formation and development of a stable modified electrode. The absence of _o_-hydroxyl substituents in the chemical structure or the irreversibility of the process observed during electrochemical oxidation, respectively, of _p_-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids, probably hinders this interaction or enhances the release rate from the surface and reduces the utility of activated glassy carbon electrode to pre-concentrate these phenolic compounds.\n\nSo, taking into consideration the selective interaction between activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic acid and/or chlorogenic compounds, without interference of ascorbic acid, the applicability of the method was tested in three different samples of orange juice. Quantification of the caffeic acid content in orange juice was accomplished by multiple standard additions of caffeic acid on activated glassy carbon electrode as described in the experimental section. Five milliliters of the orange juice was directly diluted in the voltammetric cell by adding it to \\(15\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\) of pH 5.6 acetate buffer. After 10 cycles between the potential of \\(+\\,0.1\\) and \\(+\\,0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}\\), the activated glassy carbon electrode was replaced in a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6 and characteristic cyclic voltammograms were obtained before and after the standard addition of caffeic acid. This method was also tested for aliquots of orange juice from 1.00 to \\(10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\) and the peak current increases up to a dilution limit of \\(50\\%\\) in juice:buffer. The peak rise at \\(+\\,0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) obtained in all voltammograms also increases with the amount of chlorogenic acid added as standard solution addition but has not shown any interference of _p_-coumaric, sinapic, ferulic or ascorbic acid, indicating that the modified electrode has shown high selectivity to caffeic acid or chlorogenic acid determination. The results obtained using the proposed method based on standard addition of caffeic acid are shown in Curves A and B of Fig. 7. The results obtained from the repetitions indicate that \\(2.42\\pm 0.28\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) of caffeic/chlorogenic acids are present in the Batavo orange juice samples. Danone(r) commercial orange juice presented \\(2.15\\pm 0.56\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) and Jussy(r), \\(1.85\\pm 0.39\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\), respectively. The results obtained using the proposed method are in agreement with the values provided by the literature (Robards and Antolovich, 1995) which indicate that caffeic and chlorogenic acids are the major cinnamic acid derivatives in orange juice and their usual concentrations are around \\(0.1\\)-\\(2\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) in commercial orange juices.\n\n## 4 Conclusions\n\nFrom these studies, it was concluded that cyclic voltammetry is a rapid, simple and efficient instrumental tool for evaluating the antioxidant capacity of phenolic derivatives: ferulic, _p_\n\n## Page 13\n\ncoumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acid present in orange juice. The selective interaction of activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic or chlorogenic acid offers a good method for the detection and determination of these phenolic antioxidants in complex matrices like orange juice with a high degree of sensitivity without any pre-extraction step or interference of ascorbic acid, _p_-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic or cinnamic acids since they are not deposited on modified electrode surface.\n\n## References\n\n* Baizer and Lund (1972) Baizer, M.M., Lund, H., 1972.

Their effect on the electron transport chain on thylakoids was analyzed. Alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** inhibited ATP synthesis, basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled electron transport acting as fill reaction inhibitors on spinach chloroplasts. Alkaloid **3** was not active. The inhibition and interaction site of alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** on the non-cyclic electron transport chain was studied by polarography and fluorescence of the chlorophyll \\(a\\) (Chl _a_). The results indicate that the target for **1** was localized on the donor and acceptor side of PS II. In addition alkaloids **2** and **5** affect the PS I electron acceptors on leaf discs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere has been a growing recognition that many synthetic herbicides display a variety of adverse effects. In addition, it is becoming very difficult to discover new leads structures solely by synthetic means [1]. Therefore, modern strategies for discovering new agrochemical, i.e. insecticides, herbicides, etc. are focused on natural products, because they often have a reduced environmental impact, are biodegradable and may have new sites of interaction and specificity. In a program oriented towards the discovery of novel photosynthetic inhibitors, we identified diverse secondary metabolites such as chromenes, benzofurans, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, lactones, and terpenes from selected Mexican plants [2]. Furoquinoline alkaloids have attracted much interest due to their broad range of biological activities including various physiological and pharmacological activities [3,4]. In a previous work bioactive constituents from _Swinglea glutinosa_ (Rutaceae) [4, 5, 6, 7], and from _Hortic supra_ (Rutacea) were isolated and characterized. Quinolone alkaloids, flinderinge, N-methyl-flinderinge and acridone alkaloids inhibit the light reactions of photosynthesis [8]. The acridone alkaloids that contain 2,3,5,6-dehydro-4-oxopiperidine nucleus were the most active. As a contribution on the research of the Rutaceae family, in this work we report the isolation of five furoquinoline alkaloids: evolitrine (**1**), kokusaginine (**2**), _g_-fagarine (**3**), skimmingaline (**4**) and maculosidine (**5**) (Fig. 1) from a Brazilian tree _Balfourodendron_ _riedelianum_. The plant is used in the Brazilian folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments [9]. In the search for natural product that may have herbicide activity, we studied five furoquinoline alkaloids and found that four of them act as photosynthetic inhibitors. We investigated the mechanism of action of furoquinoline alkaloids **1**-**5 on the light reaction of photosynthesis and their possible targets on the electron transport chain on thylakoids and leaves discs. Among the techniques suitable for assessing the electron transport flow in the light reactions of photosynthesis on plants subjected to chemical stress, polarography (measuring oxygen evolution and using appropriate electron acceptors, donors and inhibitors) and fluorescence induction curves of chlorophyll \\(a\\) of photosystem II (PS II) were employed in the present work. Chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence data were analyzed by the \"JIP-test analysis\" [10].\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Tested material\n\nThe natural furoquinoline alkaloids: evolitrine (**1**), kokusaginine (**2**), _g_-fagarin (**3**), skimmingaline (**4**) and maculosidine (**5**) (Fig. 1)\n\n## Page 2\n\nwere isolated from _Balfourodendron riedelianum_ (Rutaceae) as previously published [11] and were assayed on the light reaction of photosynthesis in order to evaluate their activity. Stock solutions of **1-5** were prepared using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as solvent and its maximum concentration in the medium was less than 0.5%. Log \\(P\\) Parameters and Molar volume of the alkaloids were determined for each compound by the program Chem stech from www.ACD labs.com.\n\n### Purification and Isolation of the furoquinoline alkaloids (**1-5**)\n\nThe dichloromethane extract (2.1 g) obtained from the stem barks of _B. riedelianum_ was subjected to a counter current chromatography, in the RLCC (Rotation Locular Counter Chromatography, RLCC-1000, Eyela ceramic bomb VSP-3050) apparatus using chloroform/methanol/isopropanol/water (45:60:2:40), as stationary phase in an automatic collector (Eyea fraction collector DC-120). The apparatus loop was 3.0 mL to give a group of 24 fractions in a chloroform solution stationary phase (0.3626 g), which was subjected to a column over Sephadex LH-20 (430 mm x 30 mm, 300 g) and the elution was carried out with methanol (100%) to give 7 fractions. From the fraction 3 (0.0902 g) the alkaloid 3 was obtained and from the fraction 6 (0.0137 g) **1 and 2** were isolated, and the compound **4** was isolated from the fraction 5 (0.0437 g). These metabolites were identified by spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, including 2D experiments (HSQC and HMBC), the data were compared with previous report [12, 13, 14]. A solution of methanol/H2O (25%) of the methanol extract (58.6 g) obtained from the stem bark of _Balfourodendrum riedelianum_ and then subjected to a liquid extraction to get n-hexane (5.5 g), dichloromethane (26.4 g) and ethyl acetate (2.8 g) fractions. The dichloromethane fraction was subjected to a chromatographic column (silica flash, 47.0 x 5.5 cm). The gradient elution was carried out with hexane to methanol, giving eleven fractions. The fraction 9 (1.45 g) gave rise to a new chromatographic column (silica flash + florisil (1:1), 70.0 x 2.5 cm) with gradient of elution (hexane to methanol) providing seven fractions (I-VII). The fraction IV (0.95 g) was subjected to another silica flash/Florisil (1:1) column (71.0 x 2.5 cm, eluted with gradient of hexane - ethyl acetate), giving five new fractions (A-E). The fraction E (0.06 g) was subjected to a preparative thin-layer chromatography (20 x 20 cm, 1 mm), eluted with dichloromethane (100%) to isolate maculosidine (**5**) (0.02 g). This compound was identified with spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, as previously reported [12, 13, 14].\n\n### Chloroplasts isolation and chlorophyll determination\n\nIntact chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves (_Spinacea oleracea_ L) obtained from a local market as previously described [15, 16]. Chloroplasts were isolated with a medium that contained: 400 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and buffered with 3 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, then they were re-suspended in the same medium and stored as a concentrated suspension in the dark for 1 h at 0 degC.\n\n### Measurement of ATP synthesis\n\nTo measure ATP synthesis, intact chloroplasts (20 mg/mL of chlorophyll) were broken by osmotic rupture in the following low-buffered solution: 100 mM sorbitol, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM KCN, 50 mM methylviologen (MV) (as electron acceptor at FX level), 1 mM K+-tricine (pH 8.0), and 1 mM ADP, pH adjusted to 8.0 with KOH. The ATP synthesis was determined titrimetrically using a microelectrode Orion model 8103 Ross connected to a Corning potentiometer model 12, with expanded scale as previously reported [15, 17]. The linear rate of alkalization in the light was calibrated by back-titration with saturated HCl, the ATP formed was calculated as mmol ATP mg Chl-1 h-1.\n\n### Measurement of non-cyclic electron transport rate\n\nThe Light-induced non-cyclic electron transport activity from water to MV was determined with an oxygen monitors YSI (Yellow Springs Instrument) model 5300 using a Clark type electrode as previously published [15, 18].\n\nChloroplasts (equivalent of 20 mg/mL of chlorophyll) were freshly lysed in 3 mL of the basal electron transport reaction medium: 100 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KCN, 30 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, and 50 mM MV and measured the basal electron flow by polarography. Phosphoriding non-cyclic electron transport from water to MV was measured as basal non-cyclic electron transport medium except that 1 mM ADP and 3 mM KH2. PO4 were added to the reaction medium. Uncoupled electron transport from water to MV was tested as the basal non-cyclic electron transport, and 6 mM NH4Cl was added as uncoupler to the medium. All reaction mixture was illuminated for 1 min with an actinic light of a projector lamp (GAF 2660) passed through a 5 cm filter of CuSO4 at 2% w/v.\n\nFigure 1: Structures of the isolated furoquinoline alkaloids (**1–5**)\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n### Uncoupled photosystem II (PS II) and Uncoupled photosystem I (PS I) electron flow determination\n\nUncoupled PS II from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) [19] was monitored polarographically. DCBQ accepts electrons at the D1 protein, and thus we measured the electron transport from water to Qb. The reaction medium for assaying PS II activity was the same used for basal electron transport, except that MV was omitted and 1 mM 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBMIB), 100 mM DCBQ and 6 mM NH4Cl were added. Partial reaction of PS II electron transport from water to sodium siliconyldydate (SiMo) was determined as in PS II with the same basal electron transport medium without MV, and 50 mM SiMo and 10 mM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were added [20]. These electron flow activities were monitored with a yellow spring instrument (YSI) oxygen monitor, model 5300 using a Clark type electrode.\n\nUncoupled PS I electron transport was determined using the basal electron transport medium, plus 10 mM DCMU (to inhibit PSII at Qb level), 100 mM of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) were reduced with 300 mM ascorbate and uncoupled with 6 mM NH4Cl [21]. The 150 value for each activity was extrapolated using the graph of percentage of activity versus concentration of compounds. 150 is the concentration producing 50% inhibition of the activity.\n\n### Chlorophyll a fluorescence of PS II measurements in thylakoids\n\nChlorophyll a fluorescence transients were measured with a Handy-PEA (Plant Efficent Analyzer, from Hansatech, King's Lynn, Norfolk, UK) as previously described [16]. The maximum fluorescence yield from the sample was generated by illumination for 2 s with continuous light (650 nm peak wavelength, intensity equivalent of 2830 mmol photons m-2 s-1 and gain of 0.7.) provided by an array of three light-emitting diodes. The reaction medium used was that employed in basal non-cyclic electron transport measurements with MV. To monitor Chl \\(a\\) fluorescence transients, aliquots of dark-adapted thylakoids for 5 min containing 60 mg of Chl were transferred to filter paper by gravity with a dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, United States) in order to ensure a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of thylakoids. The filter paper was dipped immediately in 3 mL of the medium with different concentrations of the tested compounds, and the control contained medium plus the amount DMSO employed for each compound at the different used concentrations.\n\nChloroplasts infiltrated with 10 mM DCMU and chloroplasts previously treated with 0.8 M Tris ((hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane) were used as positive control. Chloroplasts were incubated with slight agitation for 30 min at 4 degC with 0.8 M Tris at pH 8.0 [22].\n\nThe OIIP transients were analyzed according to the JIP test and the measured parameters were: fluorescence intensity level (_F_o) when plastolquinone electron acceptor pool (QA) is fully oxidized and fluorescence level when QA is transiently fully reduced (_F_M), \\(F\\)1 is the fluorescence intensity level at 0.05 ms, \\(F\\)2 at 0.1 ms, \\(F\\)3 at 0.3 ms, \\(F\\)4 of \\(F\\)3 at 2 ms, \\(F\\)5 at 30 ms. Area is the area over the curve for between _F_o and _F_M, and relates the pool size of PS II electron transport acceptors [23]. From these parameters other derived parameters were calculated (Table 1) with the program BioJZF HP3 (from Laboratory University of Geneva; available at [http://www.unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen](http://www.unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen)). The fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) transients were normalized using the equation \\(V_{t} = (F_{t} - F_{0})/F_{M} - F_{0}), and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients is called \"relative variable fluorescence\", if plotted versus time revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band near to 2 ms, is an indication of the \\(Q_{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\) concentration is increased [10]. \\(V\\)0 is the relative variable fluorescence between _F_o and \\(F\\)1 and is calculated as \\(V_{\\text{of}}(t) = \\text{FV}t/(F_{f} - F_{0}) = (F_{t} - F_{0})/(F_{f} - F_{0})\\) and plotted versus time. If a K-band appeared near to 0.3 ms indicate a damaged in the water splitting system on thylakoids [10].\n\n### Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements in spinach leaf discs\n\nChlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence on discs from dark-adapted spinach leaf was measured with the same equipment and conditions used for thylakoids. Fifteen spinach leaf discs (7 mm diameter) were placed in each Petri dishes with 10 mL of modified Krebs solution which contained: 115 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM Na2SO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 25 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4), then were incubated for 4 h at room temperature, after this time, different concentrations of compound was added to each Petri dish. The leaf discs were incubated for 4 h more in the presence of the compounds, then, they were dark adapted for 30 min and afterwards the fluorescence of the chlorophyll \\(a\\) was measured. The same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used for the samples treated with the analyzed compounds was added to the control samples for eliminating the solvent effect.\n\n### Plant material for in vivo assays\n\nThe seeds of _Physalis ioxocarpa_ and _Lolium perenne_, a weed species, were sown in 12 cm diameter pots and were watered daily in the greenhouse at 25-30 degC. After 15 and 18 days of emergence for _P. ioxocarpa_ and _L. perenne_, respectively, the plants were selected for similar size and were sprayed manually with the compounds **1** and **2** at concentrations of 150 and 300 mM. A stock of 20 mM of each compound was prepared in DMSO and an aliquot of this solution was taken to obtain the desired concentration in an aqueous suspension containing 0.05% w/v of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The control group was sprayed with distilled water containing the same amount of DMSO and Tween-20.\n\n### Chlorophyll a fluorescence determination in intact leaves in vivo\n\nThis was performed at room temperature with a portable Handy PEA apparatus [11] in the leaves of dark adapted-plants for 15 min both on the control and on the treated plants after 24, 40 and 72 h of being sprayed with the compounds.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Inhibition of ATP synthesis\n\nTo know the effect of the fluoroquinoline alkaloids **1**-**5** on photophosphorylation, they were assayed on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts. ATP synthesis was inhibited by **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The 150 values for this activity were 83.5 and 59.0 mM for **1** and **2**, respectively; **4** and **5** had the same value 50.5 mM and **3** was almost inactive and it was not further studied (Fig. 2).\n\n### Effect of the natural fluoroquinoline alkaloids on chloroplast electron transport rate\n\nThe light-dependent photophosphorylation is coupled to electron transport rate and can be inhibited by different ways: by blocking the electron transport, by direct inhibition of the H*-ATP-ase, or by uncoupling the ATP synthesis process from the electron transport [24]. To elucidate the mechanism of action of the fluoroquinoline alkaloids on photosynthesis, their effects on non- cyclic electron transport (basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled) from water to MV were investigated.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\nFuroquinoline alkaloids **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled electron transport as their concentrations increased up to 200 uM. The 150 values for uncoupled electron transport rate were 21.0, 18.6, 23.4 and 22.8 uM, respectively (Table 2). Compounds **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited the electron flow (in basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions) and ATP synthesis; therefore they act as Hill reaction inhibitors. Other natural products that act as Hill reaction inhibitors are the bifluoranoid isolated from _Seleginella leptohydylla_, robustflavone [25] or the furanoditerpene canophyllol isolated from _Celastrus vulcanicolo_) [16].\n\nLocalization of furoquinoline alkaloids interaction sites on the light reaction of photosystem PS II and photosystem PS I and partial reactions\n\nTo localize the inhibition site of the alkaloids on the thylakoid electron transport chain, their effects on PS II, PS I and photosystems partial reactions were tested using artificial electron donors and acceptors, as well as appropriate inhibitors [21]. Table 3 shows that **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited the uncoupled PS II electron flow from water to DCBQ; **1** inhibited PS II 100% at a concentration of 300 uM, however, alkaloids **2, 4** and **5** inhibited partially this activity (81%, 67% and 89%, respectively) at the same concentration (300 uM); therefore, **1** was the most active compound inhibiting the PS II electron transport. To further localize the inhibition site of the furoquinolines on the PS II electron transport chain, their effects were measured on the electron flow from water to SiOto (SiMo accepts electrons from phenophyrin, so in this way the electron flow measurements are from the water splitting enzyme to phenophyrin). The results indicate that **1, 2, 4** and **5** did not affect this partial reaction, since the rate of treated thylakoids were similar to the control (data not shown), therefore, all active fluoroquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electron transport chain beyond the phenophyrin site [20]. The polarographic measurements suggest that **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited electron transport between _Q_A and _Q_B of PS II, at the D1 protein by displacing _Q_B, similar to how DCMU herbicide acts. The mechanism action of **1, 2, 4** and **5** is similar to other natural products like trachydiban-19-oic acid [26], flindersine [4].\n\nUncoupled PS I electron transport rate was measured by polarography from reduced DCIPIP to MV by using increasing concentrations of the alkaloids tested, in order to find if they affect this photosystem. The results of these studies showed that the rate for control and treated samples were similar, therefore the furoquinoline alkaloids do not interact with PS I electron transport chain (data not shown).\n\nMeasurements of the Chl a fluorescence transient in thylakoids in the presence of the furoquinoline alkaloids\n\nTo corroborate the polarography results about the interaction site of the furoquinoline alkaloids at PS II, fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) were measured on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts incubated for 5 min in the dark at room temperature. Control chloroplast contained the amount of DMSO used for each treatment, the treated chloroplasts contained various concentrations of the compounds (each concentration was measured three times): chloroplasts incubated with Tris and 10 uM DCMU were used as positive control (Fig. 3). Chlorophyll \\(a\\) induction curves of thylakoids control (Fig. 3) showed an OJIP sequence similar to that previously described for plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria [27] except that phase IP was in part suppressed due to the effect of MV [28]. The chloroplasts infiltrated with DCMU and the control samples showed almost identical _F_M level (Table 4). However, the _F_M level of treated chloroplasts decreased respect to the control, while the _F_o was not been affected by almost all the compounds tested; only **1** increased lightly the _F_o level. The fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) transients were normalized, and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band (Fig. 4A). The fluorescence rise to the J-band provides information\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Fluorescence parameters derived from the extracted data \\\\ _M_\\({}_{\\bullet} \\times (F_{{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}_{{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}}}-F_{{\\text{0}}})(F_{{\\text{M}}}-F_{{\\text{0}}})\\) & Approximated initial slope (in ms−1) of the fluorescence transient _V_\\({}_{\\bullet}\\) = _f_(_t_) \\\\ Sm = (_A_(_F_)/(_F_M_ - _F_) \\\\ Yields of flux ratios \\\\ _ρ_\\text{P_{0}} = TR/_μ_/_\n\n## Page 5\n\nabout single turnover events of the primary reactions of the photochemistry, mainly \\(Q_{\\rm A}\\) reduction, indicating that the electron transport beyond \\(Q_{\\rm A}\\) is blocked at the \\(Q_{\\rm B}\\) level as DCMU does, suggesting that 1 interacts at this site and the unused energy is dissipated as heat [10]. In Fig. 4A, a small H-band was observed after 100 ms and closer to 1000 ms, this band is due to the electron acceptor MV effect [28]. In Fig. 4B, a K-band is observed in chloroplasts treated with Tris 0.8 M. Even though a small K-band is also observable in chloroplasts treated with DCMU, this band can be to the solvent effect of the ethanol where the DCMU was dissolved [28], however, the fluoroquinoline alkaloids were dissolved in DMSO as solvent and it have not any effect on the fluorescence induction curve.\n\nFurthermore, the \\(F_{m}\\) value in the presence of DCMU plus MV is similar to the control sample (Table 4). In chloroplasts treated with fluoroquinolines alkaloids plus MV decreased Fm and the parameters derived from the JIP test (see Table 1) had similar behavior with DCMU treatment (Fig. 5), with the parameter \\(\\delta\\)R\\({}_{0}\\) exception, [it reflects the efficiency with which an electron can move from the reduced electron acceptors coming of the intersystem to the PS I (reducing site) [29]; this parameter was slightly increased by the fluoroquinoline treatments (with DCMU treatment it drastically diminished). Values like RE\\({}_{\\rm a}\\)/CS, RE\\({}_{\\rm e}\\)/RC and \\(\\varphi_{\\rm Ro}\\) decreased with all treatments, being more drastic for DCMU. These results suggest that the fluoroquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electrons transport chain in two sites, one at donor and the other on the acceptor side in PS II (Fig. 5). The effect of fluoroquinoline alkaloids site at the donor side was detected only by the technique of fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) of PS II, and not by polarography technique [10].\n\n### Measurements of the Chl a fluorescence transient in leaf discs\n\nTo know if the alkaloids can reach their targets on the photosynthesis electron transport chain, fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) induction curves were measured in discs obtained from fresh spinach leaves. In Fig. 6A the DJIP sequences for control and discs treated with the most active fluoroquinoline **1** (in this case MV was omitted from the medium) showed a rise in the J peak. In discs treated with **1, 2**, and **5**** at concentration of 400 \\(\\mu\\)M, the differences between normalized curves and control showed a J-band (Fig. 6B). Furthermore **4** did not show any effect on the discs fluorescence (data not shown). J-band for **1** was bigger than for **2** and **5** (Fig. 6B). Also **1** and **2** showed a small K-band while compound **5** lacks this band (Fig. 6C). When the transients were normalized between \\(F_{M}\\) and \\(F_{5}\\), a band in the IP region appeared (30 ms to about 300 ms) for compounds **2** and **5** (Fig. 6D). Corroborating with the derived parameters from the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline Compounds & Basal & Phosphorylating & Uncoupled \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 25.0 ± 2 & 37.5 ± 2.3 & 21.0 ± 2 \\\\\n2 & 10.0 ± 4 & 10.0 ± 4 & 18.6 ± 1.35 \\\\\n4 & 29.5 ± 1.1 & 32.3 ± 1.33 & 23.4 ± 1.37 \\\\\n5 & 50.0 ± 3 & 42.6 ± 1.25 & 22.8 ± 1.66 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Iso values (μM) of **1, 2, 4, and 5** obtained from basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled electron transport rate from water to MV in spinach chloroplasts.

In addition, the quantum yield for the reduction of PSI end acceptors per photon absorbed also increased. These results suggest that end acceptors of PS I cannot be reduced because the electrons from PS II are not available. The parameters for **2** and **5** are similar to the control (Fig. 7) indicating that these compounds do not reach completely their target.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \\hline  & \\(F_{\\rm\n\n## Page 7\n\n\n\n### _In vivo assays_\n\nIn order to confirm if **1** can penetrate the intact whole leaf and affect the plants in vivo, this compound was sprayed on the leaves of _L. perenne_ and _P. ivocarpa_ plants after 15 days of growth in the green house. Studies of chlorophyll \\(a\\) Fluorescence were performed on the plants after 24, 48 and 72 h of being sprayed with **1** at 150 and 300 uM. The results showed non-significant inhibiting growth effect. These results suggest that **1** does not overcome the natural barriers provided by the plants, since the chlorophyll \\(a\\) and dry biomass of these plants were not affected by **1** (data not shown).\n\n## 4 Conclusions\n\nThe results indicated that fluoroquinoline alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** inhibited ATP synthesis and electron transport in spinach chloroplasts while **3** was inactive. The inhibition site of alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** was located at the acceptor side of PS II by polarographic technique. When these results were corroborated by chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence of PS II data; we found that the donor side of PSII is inhibited by these fluoroquinoline alkaloids. Chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence measurements on leaf discs treated with fluoroquinoline alkaloids showed changes in the induction curve of fluorescence only with **1**, transforming the QIIP trace at OJ step, showing a J band which indicates that only **1** can reach its inhibition target. However when **1** was sprayed on intact whole leaves, this compound could not penetrate the leaves plant natural barriers. Furthermore, **1** with two methoxy groups has the lowest molar volume unlike compounds **2**, **4** and **5** with 3 methoxy groups and therefore larger molar volumes which make more difficult their translocation in the leaves. Also alkaloid **3** has a lower molar volume, but it has a log_P_ value of 2.70, similar to compounds **4** and **5**. However, **1** has a high- or log_P_ value of 3.20 suggesting that this compound fulfills the specific structure requirements for inhibiting PSII electron transport chain in leaf discs that the other fluoroquinoline alkaloids studied lack these characteristics.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from DGAPA-UNAM grants PAPIT number IT102012-3 and PAIP number\n\nFig. 6: (A) Chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence (QIIP) transients of dark-adapted spinach leaf discs treated with 400 μM of fluoroquinoline **1** (•) and control (•), (B), (D) and (C) show the normalized relative variable fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) obtained with leaf discs infiltrated with 400 μM of **1** (•), **2** (•) and **5** (•).

All rights reserved.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families are rich sources of quinonemethide triterpenes (Bruning and Wagner, 1978; Gunatilaka, 1996), and these compounds have a variety of biological activities such as antitumor (Bhatnagar et al., 1979; Goncalves de Lima et al., 1971), antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971); antibiotic (Goncalves de Lima et al., 1969; Gonzalez et al., 1977); cytotoxic (Setzer et al., 1998) and antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989; Figueiredo et al., 1998) properties. Systematic studies on Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae plant species (Corsino et al., 1998a,b,c, 2000, 2003; Buffa Filho et al., 2002) have been concerned with biosynthesis of quinonemethide triterpenes, the main secondary metabolites in this taxon. The biosynthetic study dealing on _Maytenus aquifolium_ (Celastraceae) and _Salacia campestris_ (Hippocrateaceae) indicated that friedelane triterpenes are putative precursors of quinonemethide triterpenes, which are biosynthesized in the leaves and translocated to the root bark, where these compounds would be transformed into quinone methide triterpenes (Corsino et al., 2000). These findings have led us to investigate other species of Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae. _Cheiloclinium cognatum_ (Miers) A.C. Sm. (Hippocrateaceae) a tree widely distributed in the Cerrado region of Brazil, was selected to investigate the oxidative transformation on the E ring of the quinonemethide triterpenes. With this objective, we carried out a chemical study on this plant species, which led to the isolation of two new triterpenes, 228-hydroxypristimerin (**1**) and cognatine (**2**), besides seven known quinonemethide triterpenes; pristimerin (**3**), maytenin (**4**), 228-hydroxymarytenin (**5**), 202-hydroxymethyl-netazahualcoyonol (**6**), netzahualcoyondiol (**8**) and netzahualcoyone (**9**). The free radical scavenging activities of the isolates have been evaluated through a spectro-photometric assay using the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-picryl hydrazyl(DPPH).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 2. Results and discussion\n\nA CH2Cl2 soluble fraction obtained from the ethanolic extract of the root bark _C. cognatum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further purified by preparative TLC and/or HPLC, affording compounds **1-9**.\n\n22b-Hydroxypristimerin (**1**), obtained as a red amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C30H40O5 by analysis of its ESI/MS spectrum, elemental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 3450 cm-1 (hydroxyl group) and 1724 and 1645 cm-1 (carbonyl groups). The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** revealed the presence of six methyl singlets at \\(d\\) 2.13, 1.38, 1.22, 1.15, 0.99 and 0.41, attributed to H3-23, H3-25, H3-26, H3-30, H3-28 and H3-27, respectively, (Table 1). The quinon-cmethodie moiety was characterized by a doublet at \\(d\\) 6.26 (1H, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz), a singlet at \\(d\\) 6.41 (1H) and a doublet at \\(d\\) 6.94 (1H, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz) attributed to H-7, H-1 and H-6, respectively. The singlet at \\(d\\) 2.13, characteristic of a methyl group attached to a _sp_2 carbon (H3-23), corroborated the presence of a quinonemethide system. Further oxygenated functional groups were assumed to be hydroxyl and ester on the basis of NMR spectral analysis. The 13C NMR, gHHBC and gHMQC spectra (Table 2) showed the presence of 30 carbons in **1**. In the 13C NMR spectrum two carbonyl carbon signals (_d_ 178.2 and \\(d\\) 178.3) attributed to C-29 and C-2, respectively, six methyl carbons (_d_ 38.1, 32.2, 24.0, 21.6, 19.0 and 10.1), six methylene carbons (_d_ 38.1, 36.1, 33.5, 30.8, 29.5 and 28.2), four methine carbons (_d_ 134.0, 119.5, 118.0 and 46.1), 10 quaternary carbons (_d_ 169.7, 164.6, 146.0, 127.3, 117.2, 44.5, 42.6, 42.4, 39.2 and 38.2), one methoxyl carbon (_d_ 51.6) and one hydroxy-methine carbon (_d_ 67.9) were observed. The assignments were based on gHMQC and gHHBC spectra and by comparison with published data on pristimerin (Gunatilaka, 1989, 1996). The correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum from the singlet at \\(d\\) 0.99 (H3-28) to the hydroxymethine carbon at \\(d\\) 67.9 (Fig. 1) and the signals at \\(d\\) 36.1 (C-16), 38.1 (C-17) and 46.1 (C-18), confirmed the attachment of the hydroxyl group at C-22. The relative stereochemistry of H-22 was deduced by the coupling constant values (_d_ 4.02, \\(J_{22{\\rm as/21ax}}\\) = 11.0 Hz and \\(J_{22{\\rm as/21eq}}\\) = 4.0 Hz), which corroborated the _equatorial_ orientation of the hydroxyl group. The ester group was confirmed by a singlet at \\(d\\) 3.50 (3H) attributed to a methoxyl portion of the ester group at C-29, which was confirmed by means of correlation of the methyl group at \\(d\\) 1.15 (C-30) with the carbonyl carbon of the ester group at \\(d\\) 178.2 (C-29) observed in the gHMBC spectrum (Fig. 1). The structure of **1** was determined as 22b-hydroxypristimerin.\n\nCognatine (**2**), isolated as a pale yellow amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C31H38O7 by means of analysis of ESI/MS data, elemental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl group at 3438 cm-1 and carbonyl groups at 1718 and 1643 cm-1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of two singlets at \\(d\\) 6.85 (1H), attributed to H-1 and at \\(d\\) 6.00 (1H) assigned to H-7. Also, two methoxyl groups signals at \\(d\\) 3.73 and 3.74 (3H, each) were observed, which were characterized as methoxyl groups attached to C-3 and belonging to the ester group at C\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Position & **1** & **2** \\\\\n1 & 6.41 (_s_) & 6.85 (_s_) \\\\\n6 & 6.94 (_d_, \\(J\\), = 6, 5 Hz) & – \\\\\n7 & 6\n\n## Page 3\n\n29, respectively, as evidenced by gHMBC experiments (Fig. 2). Other singlets integrating for 3H each were observed at \\(\\delta\\) 2.67, assigned to a methyl group on aromatic ring (H\\({}_{3}\\)-23), at \\(\\delta\\) 1.72 assigned to one methyl group on double bond (C-26) and at \\(\\delta\\) 1.38, 1.33, 0.95 and 0.90, corresponding to tertiary methyl groups (H\\({}_{3}\\)-28, H\\({}_{3}\\)-25, H\\({}_{3}\\)-30 and H\\({}_{3}\\)-27, respectively).\n\nThe analysis of the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR (Table 2), gHMQC and gHMBC spectral data indicated the presence of three carbonyl carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 214.0, 185.8 and 175.2 attributed to C-22, C-6 and C-29, respectively, six methyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 27.6, 23.9, 22.5, 21.7, 15.1 and 13.7, attributed to C-25, C-27, C-28, C-26, C-23 and C-30, respectively, two vinylic carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 134.7 and 125.9, two vinylic carbons conjugated to carbonyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 160.1 and 129.3, four methylene carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 38.0, 37.1, 35.8 and 34.2, one methine carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 46.2, five quaternary aromatic carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 151.7, 151.2, 144.7, 134.0 and 122.4. The remaining signal was an unsubstituted aromatic carbon (\\(\\delta\\) 110.1), which was assigned to C-1. Additionally, sig\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline Position & **1** & **2** & **7** & **8** & **9** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 119.5 \\(d\\) & 110.1 \\(d\\) & 119.4 \\(d\\) & 120.0 \\(d\\) & 120.1\n\n## Page 4\n\nnals for four quaternary carbons (\\(\\delta\\) 42.2, 40.7, 48.8 and 50.3), two \\(sp^{3}\\) carbons belonging to methoxyl groups (\\(\\delta\\) 52.7 and 61.7) and one hydroxymethine carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 74.3 were also observed.\n\nThe gHMBC data (Fig. 2) showed the correlation of the singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 6.85 (H-I) to the carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 151.7 (C-2), \\(\\delta\\) 144.7 (C-3), \\(\\delta\\) 122.4 (C-5) and \\(\\delta\\) 42.2 (C-9) and the singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 6.00 (H-7) to the carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 134.7 (C-4), \\(\\delta\\) 122.4 (C-5) and \\(\\delta\\) 42.2 (C-9) corroborating unambiguously the assignments of H-I and H-7. Besides, the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 6.85 (1H, H-I) was correlated to \\(\\delta\\) 110.1 (C-I) and the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 6.00 (1H, H-7) showed correlation to \\(\\delta\\) 129.3 (C-7) in the HMQC spectrum. The correlation between the methoxy signal at \\(\\delta\\) 3.73 and the carbon signal at \\(\\delta\\) 144.7 confirmed the position of the methoxyl group at C-3. Also, the gHMBC spectrum showed correlations from the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.22 (H\\({}_{3}\\)-26) to signals at \\(\\delta\\) 125.9 and \\(\\delta\\) 134.7, assigned to carbons C-14 and C-15, respectively. The signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.38 (H\\({}_{3}\\)-28) showed correlations with the carbon signal at \\(\\delta\\) 38.0 (C-16) and also with the carbonyl signal at \\(\\delta\\) 214.0, which confirmed the position of one carbonyl group at C-22. An additional correlation from the methyl signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.72 (H\\({}_{3}\\)-26) to the carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 38.0 (C-16) corroborated the attribution of the other carbonyl at C-6, with the chemical shift at \\(\\delta\\) 185.6 being characteristic of an \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carbonyl and C-16, a methylenic carbon. The remaining gHMBC correlations from H\\({}_{3}\\)-30 (\\(\\delta\\) 0.95) to C-19 (\\(\\delta\\) 34.2) and the hydroxymethine carbon at C-21 (\\(\\delta\\) 74.3), besides correlation of methoxyl hydrogens at \\(\\delta\\) 3.74 with the carbonyl signal at C-29 (\\(\\delta\\) 175.2), established the proposed structure **2** for cognate.\n\nThe known compounds pristimerin **(3)**, maytenin **(4)**, 22\\(\\beta\\)-hydroxymaytenin **(5)** and 20\\(\\alpha\\)-hydroxymaytenin **(6)** were identified by comparison with published data (Gunatilaka, 1989; Gunatilaka, 1996; Dhanabalasingham et al., 1996; Furlan et al., 1990). Compounds **7-9** had been previously isolated from _Orthosphenia mexicana_ (Gonzalez et al., 1983), but a number of inconsistencies were found regarding the assignments of published \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data. The analysis of 2D NMR spectra allowed accurate assignment of \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR signals mostly based on gHMQC and gHMBC experiments.\n\nThe spectrophotometric assay using DPPH indicated a prominent free radical scavenging activity for some of the isolated quinonemethide triterpenes (Fig. 3). The stable free radical DPPH has an absorption maximum at 517 nm, which decreases upon reduction through reaction with an antioxidant compound. The free radical scavenging activity of quinonemethide triterpenes is mostly due to the \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carbonyl moiety with extended conjugation through ring B, e.g. in compounds **1** and **3-6** or B-D, e.g. in compounds **7-9**. These features stabilize the quinonemethide free radical promptly formed after loss of one radical hydrogen, donated to the DPPH. The more extended conjugations of triterpenes **7-9** account for their higher free radical scavenging abilities (ca. 45% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) when compared to compounds **1-6** (less than 30% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M). The phenolic triterpene **2** exhibited the lowest activity (18% at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) probably due to the lack of conjugation through rings B-D. The free radical scavenging ability of the quinonemethide triterpenes and a standard compound rutin (66% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) are due to catechol moiety present in the B ring of rutin the C2-C3 double bond (van Acker et al., 1996). The synthetic antioxidant BHT (11% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) exhibited the weakest antiradical activity as expected due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH (Bondet et al., 1997).\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Plant material\n\nRoot bars of _C. cognatum_ (Hippocrateaceae) were collected at Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, GO and identified by Dr Julio Antonio Lombardi (Departamento de Botanica do Institute de Ciencias Biologicas - Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG). A voucher specimen (No. 19797) is deposited at Herbarium of Institute de Ciencias Biologicas - UFG, Goias.\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography\n\nSilica gel (Merck, 230-400 and 70-230 mesh) were used for CC unless otherwise stated and solvents were distilled prior to use. \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) as solvent and TMS as reference. HPLC separations were performed using a Shimadzu LC-10AS. Preparative HPLC separation were performed on a Varian PROSTAR, using a reversed phase column (Phenomenex-Luna C\\({}_{18}\\), 21.2 x 250 mm,\n\nFig. 3: Radical scavenging activity of compounds **1–9** and standards rutin and BHT.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\n10 \\(\\mu\\)m), eluted with MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (7:3, with 0.05\\(\\%\\) H\\({}_{3}\\)PO\\({}_{4}\\)) detection at 420 nm. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ESI-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nDried and powdered root barks of _C. cognatum_ (690.0 g) were extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a brown gum (210.6 g), which was submitted to liquid-liquid partitioning. The CH\\({}_{2}\\)C1\\({}_{2}\\) soluble part of the EtOH extract was concentrated in vacuo (25.5 g), submitted to a silica gel column (600 g, 70-230 mesh) eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient, yielding 41 fractions (A\\({}_{1}\\)-A\\({}_{41}\\)). Fraction A\\({}_{9}\\)-A\\({}_{11}\\) (1.48 g) was submitted to a flash silica gel CC (230-400 mesh), eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient resulting in 32 fractions (B\\({}_{1}\\)-B\\({}_{41}\\)). Fraction B\\({}_{10}\\)-B\\({}_{14}\\) (0.154 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] yielding compound **3** (55 mg). Fraction B\\({}_{18}\\)-B\\({}_{21}\\) (0.085 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] affording compound **4** (34 mg). Fraction A\\({}_{16}\\)-A\\({}_{17}\\) (3.55 g) was submitted to flash silica gel CC (70-230 mesh), eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 46 fractions (C\\({}_{1}\\)-C\\({}_{46}\\)).

HPLC [MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (7:3), \\(\\lambda=420\\) nm, 10 mL min\\({}^{-1}\\)] affording compounds **7** (18 mg) and **2** (4 mg).\n\n### Radical scavenging activity on DPPH radical\n\nRadical scavenging activity was assayed according to the Blois method (Blois, 1958). The free radical scavenging capacities of quinonemethide triterpenes and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated based on their ability to reduce the free radical already assigned (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 ml) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 to 100 \\(\\mu\\)M were then prepared in MeOH and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004\\(\\%\\)) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated (see Fig. 3).\n\n### 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1)\n\nAmorphous solid.

Their IR spectra revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (1466, 1690 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** (Table 1) showed two aromatic signals, one at \\(\\delta\\) 6.87 (1H, _s_) and the other at \\(\\delta\\) 6.43 (1H, _s_), suggesting a tetra-substituted aromatic spin-system with a _para_ configuration. A series of complex signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.76 (1H, _m_) 3.35 (4H, _m_); \\(\\delta\\) 3.04 (1H, _m_) and \\(\\delta\\) 2.30 (1H, _m_) were indicative of two carbonic and two benzyl hydrogens, respectively. Further signals at \\(\\delta\\) 0.51 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 1.03 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 2.05 (3H, _s_) revealed the presence of two aliphatic and one aromatic methyl groups in the molecule.\n\nThe 13C NMR chemical shifts for **1** along with the information obtained from a DEPT-135 experiment (Table 1), indicated a total of 15 signals, suggesting a sesquiterpene: six aromatic carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 152.9 (_s_), 141.1 (_s_), 128.1 (_d_), 127.4 (_s_), 121.9 (_s_) and 114.7 (_d_), confirming the tetra-substitution for the aromatic moiety and the _para_ hydrogen system; two carbonic signals: a methine at \\(\\delta\\) 67.8 and a methylene at \\(\\delta\\) 64.4; three signals for methines at \\(\\delta\\) 40.1, 38.4 and 36.5; one aliphatic methylene at \\(\\delta\\) 24.6 and three signals for methyl groups: \\(\\delta\\) 16.7, 15.9 and 10.8. The above data suggested a caldinane skeleton (Zhang et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 1996). The total attribution for the observed signals was accomplished based on gHMQC correlations.\n\nAdditional gHMBC correlations of H-5 (\\(\\delta\\) 6.87) with C-15 and C-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 15.9 and \\(\\delta\\) 36.5, respectively) and H-2 (\\(\\delta\\) 6.43) with C-10 and C-4 (\\(\\delta\\) 40.1 and \\(\\delta\\) 121.9) allowed us to fully determine the aromatic moiety. The phenolic function linked at C-3, was supported by the correlations between H-15 (\\(\\delta\\) 2.05) and C-3/C-5 (\\(\\delta\\) 152.9 and \\(\\delta\\) 128.1, respectively). The linkage of the _p_-methane moiety was determined through the correlations shown by C-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 141.1) with H-14/H-9 (\\(\\delta\\) 1.03/\\(\\delta\\) 3.76) and C-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 127.4) with, H-11/H-8\\(\\delta\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 2.70/\\(\\delta\\) 1.52). Observed correlations between C-12 \\(\\rightarrow\\) H-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 64.4/3.04) and H-13 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 0.51/36.5) allowed us to fully determine the calamenene skeleton (Nagashima et al., 1996).\n\n_g_NOESY was useful to establish the relative configuration of the stereocenters for **1**. A correlations between Me-14 and Me-13 confirmed a _cis_-calamenene, according to reported literature (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993). Further observed correlations between H-9a and H-7 allowed us to confirm a (_cis_)-1,3-_pseudo_-diaxial relationship between these centers (Nabeta et al., 1993). We were not able to determine the configuration of the stereocenter at C-11, due to free rotation of this center with C-7-C-11 bond. Compound **1** was thus identified as the rel. (\\(-\\))-(7S,9S,10S)-3,9,12-trihydroxycalamenene.\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H22O3 ([M + H-H2O]\\({}^{+}\\)) at _m_/_z_ 233.1542. The obtained mass and similarities observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) indicated that **2** was a diastereoisomer of **1**. The main spectroscopic differences observed for this molecule were elucidated by using gNOESY. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 indicated that both groups remained in a _cis_ conformation. The appearance of a strong correlation of Me-14 and H-9 indicated that H-7 and H-9 were in a _trans_ conformation. Further comparisons with reported data (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c c} No. & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** & \\\\ \\hline \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C \\\\ \\hline\n1 & & 141.1 & & 139.0 & & 142.1 & & 134.7 & & 1\n\n## Page 3\n\net al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993) allowed us to provisionally deduce identify **2** as rel. (+)-(75,9\\(R\\), 10S) the C-9 diastereo-isomer of **1.**\n\nCompound **3** was isolated as a white amorphous powder. HRESI mass data allowed us to propose the molecular formula C15H22O2 ([M + H]+ at _m/z_ 235.1777). The absence of an oxygen atom in this molecule allowed us to provisionally deduce that a reduction occurred at position C-9. This reduction was confirmed by 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) due to the presence of the signal at \\(d\\) 28.5 and the lack of the carboxymethine signal at \\(d\\) 67.8/69.1 present in **1** and **2**, respectively.\n\nA correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 was observed in the _g_NOESY experiment thus concluding that **3** has a _cis_ calamenene relative stereochemistry. Observed correlations between H-9a and H-8a and H-7 defined their relative configuration also as _cis_. Further observed correlations between H-8b and H-9b, confirmed the relative configuration established for the _p_-menthane moiety. Compound **3** was hence identified as the rel. (+)-(75,10S) 3,12-dihydroxycalamenene.\n\nCompound **4** was isolated as a white amorphous powder. A molecular formula C15H18O2 ([M + H]+ at _m/z_ 231.1405) was obtained after HRESI mass data analysis. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed a new aromatic hydrogen spin system at \\(d\\) 7.03 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and \\(d\\) 6.93 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) with an _ortho_ configuration. The downfield shift observed for Me-14 (_t_  1.3) was indicative of an aromatization of the _p_-menthane moiety (Nabeta et al., 1994). 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) data showed 10 aromatic carbons, three methyls: two benzylic _g_HMQC, _g_HMBC, and compared with reported data for cadalene analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975).\n\nFurther correlations observed in the _g_HMBC experiment, particularly the ones of H-8 (_d_ 6.93) with C-6/C-11 and H-9 (_d_ 7.03) with C-1/C-14 allowed us to fully determine the substitution pattern of the B ring for the naphthalene moiety. Compound **4** was identified as 3,12-dihydroxycadalene.\n\nCompound **5** was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H18O3 ([M + Na]+ at _m/z_ 269.1179). The appearance of a hydroxyl group in **5** was corroborated by the loss of the signal assigned to H-11 (_d_ 3.59) in **4** thus suggesting that oxidation had occurred at this position. 13C NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopic data corroborated this assumption showing a signal at \\(d\\) 75.3 (_s_) which exhibited a correlation showed in the _g_HMBC experiment with H-8 (_d_ 7.21) indicating that the new oxidized position was at C-11. Other correlations were determined using _g_COSY, _g_HMQC, and compared with reported data for analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Compound **5** was identified as the new 3,11,12-trihydroxycadalene.\n\nThe antifungal activity of compounds **1**-**5** against the phytopathogenic fungi _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ was evaluated by bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). The compound 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (**2**) exhibited potent activity against two fungi. The detection limit for the compound **5** was found to be 1.0 mg, comparable with the same amount of the standard nystatin.\n\nCytotoxicity of the compounds **1**-**5** against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983). Compound **4** exhibited\n\n## Page 4\n\ncytotoxicity against cell line (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 20 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)), and **3** and **5** a weak cytotoxicity (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 100 and 110 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{-1}\\), respectively). Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC\\({}_{50}\\) 5 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{-1}\\).\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedure\n\nOptical rotations were determined at room temperature using Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer and Perkin-Elmer UV-Vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on Microquimica MQAPF-301. \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra; _g_HMBC and _g_HMQC, _g_COSY and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive and negative ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-resolution orthogonal time of flight (o-TOF) configuration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 \\(\\mu\\)ml/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH-H\\({}_{2}\\)O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using a ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/ MS spectra of mass selected ions were acquired using 10-20 eV collisions with argon. For preparative HPLC separations, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, and a Phenyl-hexyl Luna Phenomenex column, (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 \\(\\mu\\)m), were used in this study. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromato-integrator connected to a UV detector.\n\nTLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisal-dehyde 5% in H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) followed by heating.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _C. spectabilis_ plant material was collected in the Chemistry Institute UNESP - Aranaquara, SP, Brazil in June 17, 2001 by G.H. Silva. The botanical identification was made by Professor Maria Claudia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SILVA - 193).\n\n### Isolation of the endophytic fungus\n\nThe fungal strain _P. cassiae_ was an endophyte isolated from leaves of _C. spectabilis_. The leaves were washed in running H\\({}_{2}\\)O and surface sterilized by successive soaking in NaOCl 1% for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 1 min and then rinsed twice with water. Aseptically the leaves were cut open and 1 x 1 cm\\({}^{2}\\) pieces of the leaves were placed on water agar in Petri plates. After incubation at 25 degC for seven days, individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maier et al., 1997). During the first three weeks of incubation, the cultures were periodically checked for purity and successively subcultured by hyphal tipping method until pure culture was obtained. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar. The taxonomic identification as _P. cassiae_ was performed based on fungal morphology by Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited Cole-cao Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lavras fungal herbarium and assigned as CML 292.\n\n### Growth of P. cassiae and production of the EtOAc extract\n\nThe fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 degC for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 x 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the _P. cassiae_ isolated were inoculated into each flask and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 degC on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration. The culture broth was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 2,0 L). The EtOAc extracts were combined, filtered, and evaporated _in vacuo_ to give a yellow oil (277.12 mg).\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\nThe microorganisms _C. cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and _C. sphareospermum_ (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds **1**-**5** were applied on a precoated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 \\(\\mu\\)L) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 \\(\\mu\\)g. After eluting with CHCl\\({}_{3}\\):CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control.\n\n### Cytotoxicity bioassays\n\nThe human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described (Mosmann, 1983).

The structures of the isolated lignans were elucidated by interpretation of their spectroscopic data, including by gHMQC and gHMBC. The relative and absolute configurations of the isolates were determined from NOESY interactions and optical properties, respectively. Four of the lignans were diastereomeric whilst one was of mixed biosynthetic origin. All but one of the lignans exhibited high _in vitro_ trypanocidal activity when assayed against epimastigotes of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ strain Y.\n\nkeywords: _Peperonia blanda_; Piperaceae; Tetrahydrofuran lignans; Structural elucidation; Trypanocidal activity +\nFootnote †: journal:\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nChagas disease is one of the most widespread of tropical diseases, being endemic in 21 countries, with some 16-18 million individuals infected and a further 100 million people at risk (Molfetta et al., 2005; Pozas et al., 2005).\n\nSignificant antiprotozoan activities have recently been reported for a number of lignans derived from members of the Piperaceae family (Martins et al., 2003; Luize et al., 2006). This family, which is included among the basal angiosperms and can be found in the tropics mainly as pioneer plants, has been the subject of numerous phytochemical investigations. The major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Parmar et al., 1997; Benevides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Moreira et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005).\n\n_Piper_ and _Peperonia_ represent the most important genera of the Piperaceae family with 2000 (Wanke et al., 2006) and 1700 species (Quijano-Abril et al., 2006), respectively. Species of _Peperonia_ are well known as ornamental plants and have found application in folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, asthma and gastric ulcers, and as analgesic and antibacterial agents (Arrigon-Blank et al., 2004). The major classes of compounds present in the relatively few species of _Peperonia_ that have been investigated are prenylated phenols and benzoic acids (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Seeram et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998; Salazar et al., 2005), and also dibenzylbutarolactone and dibenzylbutanediol lignans (Li et al., 2006).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAdditionally, several lignans (Li et al., 2007) and unusual seco- and nor-lignans have also been described (Bayma et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006). More recently, two new tetrahydrofuran lignans were isolated from _Peperomia pellucida_ (Xu et al., 2006) and thus a phenylprognoid-based lineage for the _Peperomia_ species can be supported.\n\n_Peperomia blanda_ H.B. & K. is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet rock crevices (Guimaraes and Giordano, 2004). At the present time, information is only available concerning the essential oil (Santos et al., 2001) and two chromenes isolated from the non-polar fraction of the aerial parts of the species (Velozo et al., 2006). In the present work, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of four new tetrahydrofuran lignan stereoisomers and a new tetrahydrofuran lignan of mixed biosynthetic origin. The antitripanosomal properties of these novel lignans have been determined.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe EtOAc extract derived from aerial parts of _P. blanda_ was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 was fractionated chromatography to yield five lignans **1-5**; (Fig. 1) and two flavones (**6** and **7**). The 1H NMR spectra of compounds **1-4** were characteristic of non-symmetric tetrahydrofuran lignans since each exhibited a pair of doublets at \\(d\\) 0.63 +- 0.05 (CH3-9) and 1.04 +- 0.04 (CH3-9') corresponding to methyl groups, a second set of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.03 +- 0.02 (H-7) and 4.32 +- 0.03 (H-7') that were assignable to oxybenzyl methine groups, and multiplets at \\(d\\) 2.18 +- 0.03 and 1.69 +- 0.03 associated, respectively, with the H8 and H8' protons. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data corroborated the presence of the tetrahydrofuran system in each case, and all signals were assigned accordingly based on HMBC data (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nAs previously reported (Biftu and Stevenson, 1987; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989), the coupling constants of 8.5 and 9.0 Hz for the doublet at \\(d\\) 5.05, and of 4.33 Hz for H-7 and H-7' indicate that these hydrogens are in a _trans_ configuration with the adjacent H-8 and H-8' in a tetrahydrofuran ring. Differential NOE experiments (Fig. 2) confirmed the relative stereochemistry of all of the lignans isolated. Thus, as for lignan 3, H-7 showed clear NOE correlations with H-7' and H-8, H-7' correlated with H-7, H-8 and H-9', and H-8' correlated with H-9 confirming the _trans_ configuration of the adjacent H-8 and H-8' and a _cis_ configuration between H-7 and H-7'.\n\nThe differences observed in the NMR spectra of compounds **1-4** were due to different substitution patterns in the aromatic ring. The molecular formula of lignan 1 was established as C22H26O7 by HRMS. The aromatic moieties were determined to be syringyl and 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups on the following basis: (i) two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.49 (_s_, 2H) correlated to H7 in the HMBC spectrum, (ii) aromatic carbons C3 and C5 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.80) and to H2/H6, and (iii) the second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at \\(d\\) 6.61 (H2') and 6.64 (H6'), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-4' and C-7' in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, **1** was established as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S-4-hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,5,3'-trimethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan_.\n\nCompound **2** showed a molecular formula of C23H28O7 by HRMS. 1H NMR spectra indicated two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.48 (_s_, 2H) correlating to H7 in the HMBC spectrum and aromatic carbons C3, C5 at \\(d\\) 152.8 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.77) and to H2/H6 and subsequently, C4 at \\(d\\) 136.6 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.76). The second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at \\(d\\) 6.61 (H2') and 6.64 (H6'), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-4' and C-7' in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, **2** was identified as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S)-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,3'-tetramethylenedioxy-7,7'-epoxylignan, i.e., a methylated derivative of **1**.\n\nThe molecular formula of **3** was determined to be C23H30O7 by HRMS, and the aromatic moieties were identified as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylophenyl groups. The aromatic singlets at \\(d\\) 6.49 and 6.67 were assigned to separate aromatic groups, since the HMBC showed correlation to H7 (_d_ 5.03) and H7' (_d_ 4.34), respectively. The remaining correlations between C3/C3', C4/C4' and C5/C5' perfectly matched those of H2/H2'and H6/H6'. Thus compound **3** was determined as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S)-4'-hydroxy-3,4,5,3',5'-pentamethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan_.\n\nCompound **4** showed the molecular formula C22H24O7 by HRMS, and both aromatic moieties were identified as 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups for the signals at \\(d\\) 5.97 (_s_, 2H) and \\(d\\) 5.96 (_s_, 2H) due to methylenedioxyphenyl groups connected to C4/C5 and C4'/C5', respectively. At \\(d\\) 3.93 (_s_, 3H) and \\(d\\) 3.90 (_s_, 3H) are the resonances of two methoxyl groups correlated to C3 and C3'.\n\nFig. 1: Tetrahydrofuran lignans isolated from the aerial parts of _Peperomia blanda_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe identity of **4** was thus established as _rel_-(7\\(R\\),8\\(S\\),7_'S_,8_'S_)-4,5_,4_'_,5_'_-dimethylenedioxy-3,3'_-dimethoxy-7,7'_-_-_epoxysilignan.\n\nThe molecular formula of **5** was established as C23H28O8 by HRMS. The compound differed from lignans **1-4** in respect to a hydroxyl group linked to C-9. The presence of this group was deduced from various sources: the IR spectrum (absorption at 3450 cm-1), from the 1H NMR by signals at \\(d\\) 3.40 (2H, m), from the 13C NMR both from resonances at \\(d\\) 62.5 and the presence of only one methyl group (_d_ 1.08; \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz), and from the HMBC, which showed connectivity between the H9 protons and C7. Thus, **5** was determined as _rel_-(7\\(R\\),8\\(S\\),7_'S_,8_'S_)-9-hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,3'-tetramethoxy-7,7'-\n\nepoxylignan.\n\nThe known flavones 5-hydroxy-4',7,8-trimethoxyflavone (**6**) and 5-hydroxy-3',4',7,8-tetramethylaxone (**7**) were also identified in the extract derived from the aerial parts of _P. blanda_. These compounds have been previously isolated from _Peperomia sui_ (Cheng et al., 2003).\n\nCompounds **1-5** were submitted to bioassay against epimastigotes of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ strain Y and the respective IC50 values are shown in Table 3. All of the lignans exhibited potent trypanocidal activity.

The trypanocidal activity of these compounds was evaluated against epimastigotes of _T. cruzi_ strain Y. All of the isolates showed potent activity when compared with the positive control benzidazole.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General\n\n\\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HREIMS were measured using a Bruker Daltronics model ultraTOFo ESI-TOF instrument. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar model SD-1 LC/UV/VIS chromatograph equipped with a Supelcosil C-18 reversed phase column (250 x 21.2 mm; Supelco). IR spectra were measured in KBr pellets in a Perkin-Elmer Infrared spectrometer FTIR series 1600. Optical rotations were measured at \\(\\lambda = 589\\) nm in a digital polarimeter JASCO model DIP-370. UV spectra were recorded in MeOH using a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer. Separations by CC were carried out using silica gel (230-400 mesh; Merck). All solvents were redistilled prior to use.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe aerial parts of _P. blanda_ were collected at the Reserva da Ripasa, Ibate - SP, Brazil in January of 2005 and identified by Dra. Elsie Franklin Guimaraes. A voucher specimen (Kato-547) has been deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Biociencias, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo - SP, Brazil.\n\n### Isolation of compounds\n\nDried aerial parts (86 g) of _P. blanda_ were milled, extracted with EtOAc (1.2 L) for 4 hours at room temperature, and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude extract (8.5 g). This extract was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 (1.95 g) was submitted to CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc to yield fractions 1-14. The precipitate present in fraction 3 (420 mg) was purified by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound **6** (6.3 mg), whilst the soluble part was submitted to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc producing subfractions 3-1 to 3-60. Subfractions 3-20 (12 mg) and 3-43 (46 mg) afforded compounds **4** and **2**, respectively. Fraction 4 (220 mg) was submitted to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc providing subfractions 4-1 to 4-37. Subfraction 4-23 (98 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (72:28) to afford compound **1** (8.6 mg). The precipitate present in fraction 6 (103 mg) was purified by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound **7** (8.0 mg). Fraction 7 (350 mg) was subjected to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc resulting in subfractions 7-1 to 7-167. Subfraction 7-140 afforded compound **5** (7 mg). Subfraction 7-79 (95.0 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (2:3) to yield five fractions, the penultimate of which afforded compound **3** (17 mg).\n\n### rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S)-4-Hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,5,3'-trimethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan (1)\n\nPale yellow oil, \\([\\alpha]_{\\text{D}}^{21}-52.8\\) (MeOH; \\(c\\) 0.125).

In vitro bioassays\n\nThe biological assays with epimastigote forms of _T. cruzi_ strain Y were performed as described previously (Bernacchi et al., 2002). Tetrahydrofuran lignans and benzmidazole (Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were stored as 1.0 mg ml\\({}^{-1}\\) stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and were serially diluted (1:3) prior to use with liver-infusion tryptose (LIT) medium to provide concentrations of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg ml\\({}^{-1}\\), each in triplicate. The number of viable protozoa was determined by counting in a Neubauer chamber after 72 h incubation at 28 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC\\({}_{50}\\)) values were calculated by fitting a nonlinear regression curve (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) and comparing with those of benzmidazole, the positive control. A one-way ANOVA test was used to establish the significance level of the activity corresponding to each compound evaluated in the _in vitro_ assay.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) with Grants 03/11524-9 and 05/57042-0, and also as part of the Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (BIOTA/FAPESP - [http://www.bio-tasp.org.br](http://www.bio-tasp.org.br)).

The structures of all compounds were elucidated primarily from 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All flavonoids were screened to identify secondary metabolites as potential myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitors, and at concentrations of 0.50-50 nM, quercetin (**5**), isoquercetin (**6**) and rutin (**7**) exhibited strong inhibitory effects with IC50 values of \\(1.22\\pm 0.01\\), \\(3.75\\pm 0.02\\) and \\(3.60\\pm 0.02\\), respectively. The MPO activity detected for the new derivative **1** was markedly decreased (IC50 \\(10.3\\pm 0.03\\)) when compared with known flavonoids **5-7**, and interestingly increased when tested against ABTS scavenging activity.\n\nkeywords: _Pterogyne nitens_; Fabaceae; Acylated flavonoid; Myeloperoxidase; Antioxidant +\nFootnote †: journal: Nuclear Medicine\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nMyeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-enzyme present in human neutrophils and plays a role in infection and inflammation, converting hydrogen peroxide and chloride to hypochlorous acid and water (Winterbourn et al., 2000). Although hypochlorous acid has important roles in killing microorganisms, it also possesses high reactivity and the ability to damage macromolecules by oxidation (Teixeira et al., 2003). The excessive MPO activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially HOCl, production are implicated in many inflammatory processes (Heinecke et al., 1993; Gurel et al., 2004), including atherosclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease; the search for new myeloperoxidase inhibitors from natural sources has become a staple in drug discovery.\n\n_Pterogyne nitens_ (Fabaceae) is popularly named in Brazil as \"tipa\", \"viraro\", \"cocal\", \"amendoinzeiro\", \"amendoim-bravo\", according to the region where this plant grows. It is a beautiful legume tree, and the sole member of the genus _Pterogyne_, which is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, and can reach a height of 5-12 m. (Burkart, 1952). Its wood is also widely\n\n## Page 2\n\nused in building construction and, to our knowledge, there are no reports on ethnomedicinal uses for this species (Lorenzi, 1998).\n\nOur previous studies on _P. nitens_ have resulted in the isolation of flavones, and five guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited selective activity towards a DNA repair-deficient strain of yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, suggesting potential anti-cancer activity (Bolzani et al., 1995). In our continuing interest in searching for new biologically active metabolites from plants of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest regions, we have investigated the fruits of this plant, collected at the Botanical Garden, Sao Paulo, in May 2003. We report herein the isolation, and structural elucidation of one new flavonoid rhamnoside, namely pterogynoside (**1**) and six known flavonoids: kaempferol (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (Pizzolatti et al., 2003), quercetin, isoquercitrin and rutin (Markham et al., 1978). Additionally, these compounds were screened for MPO inhibitory activity, using a guaiacol oxidation method (Capeillere-Blandin, 1998). The new flavonoid **1** was also analyzed for the scavenging of DPPH and ABTS free radicals activities and its antioxidant potential was evaluated (see Fig. 1).\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nShade-dried, powdered fruits of _P. nitens_ were first defatted with _n_-hexane and exhaustively extracted by re-maceration with ethanol. The solvent was evaporated at low temperature under reduced pressure to yield a syrup which was suspended in methanol-water (4:1) and then successively partitioned with ethyl acetate and _n_-butyl alcohol. The resulting fractions were subjected to successive column chromatography separation steps to yield pterogynoside (**1**) along with six known flavonoids.\n\nPterogynoside (**1**) was isolated as yellow prisms, m.p. 272-273 degC, and gave a positive reaction with ferric chloride, indicating it as a phenol derivative. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl (3280 cm-1), chelated hydroxy group (3265 cm-1), conjugated ester (1695 cm-1), conjugated ketone (1650 cm-1) and aromatic C=C absorptions (1612, 1593, 1550 and 1508 cm-1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions (_l_max) (log_e_) at 316 (4.53) and 297 (4.29), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a flavonoid structure (Mabry et al., 1970; Agrawal et al., 1989). The UV spectra recorded in EtOH and shift reagents such as KOH, NaOAc and AlCl3 suggested the presence of free hydroxy groups at C-4', C-7 and C-5, respectively. Its elemental composition C29H26O14, with 17deg of unsaturation, was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([M-H]-) at _m_/_z_ 597.5087 (caled for C29H26O14, 597.5081) consistent with its \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data (Table 1, Supporting Information). The CID (collision induced dissociation) experiments using the product ion scan mode (MS2) allowed characterization and establishment of the fragmentation pathway of pterogynoside, with an intense (64%) kaempferol peak at _m_/_z_ 285 in the negative ion mode. The positive ion mode also gave an intense kaempferol peak at _m_/_z_ 287. Further MS analysis showed a deprotonated ion peak at _m_/_z_ 597, and a product ion at _m_/_z_ 431 indicating the presence of one hexose residue in compound **1**.

The assignment of all proton and carbon signals followed from extensive analysis of 1H-1H _g_COSY, _g_HMQC, and _g_HMBC spectra (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectrum of **1** presented 29 carbons deduced from DEPT 90deg, DEPT 135deg and _g_HMQC techniques as one methyl, thirteen methines, one methoxyl and fourteen quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at \\(d\\) 167.7 and \\(d\\) 179.5, attributed to ester and ketone groups, respectively. The 1H NMR and 1H-1H _g_COSY spectra (Table 1) showed an A2M2 spin system assigned to the hydrogen signals at \\(d\\) 7.74 (2H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, H-2'', 6') and 6.87 (2H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, H-3', 5') attributed to a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring; and a pair of doublets at \\(d\\) 6.10 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-6) and 6.29 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-8) for the trioxygenated A ring of compound **1**, suggesting a kaempferol moiety for its aglycone. Additionally, the 1H NMR resonances at \\(d\\) 5.38 and 0.89 evidenced an a-rhamnopyranosyl moiety, which was confirmed by observation of correlated signals at \\(d\\) 103.6, \\(d\\) and \\(d\\) 17.7 in the HMQC spectrum. A cross-peak between the signals for C-3 (_d_136.0) and the anomeric hydrogen H-1'' (_d_ 5.38) in the _g_HMBC spectrum indicated the position of the rhamnosyl unit at C-3 of the kaempferol moiety. Further analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) indicated an additional methylgallate unit in compound **1**, which was placed at C-3'' of the rhamnopyranosyl moiety due to the downfield chemical shift observed for H-3'' (_d_ 5.11), and a _g_HMBC cross-peak of H-3'' with the carbonyl ester C-7'' (_d_ 167.7). An additional _g_HMBC correlation was observed between the signal at \\(d\\) 141.2 (C-4'') and \\(d\\) 3.77 (OMe) which confirmed the position of the methoxy group at C-4''. Hence, the structure of pterogynoside (**1**) was completely elucidated, and established as kaempferol-3-_O_-(3''-_O_-4''-methylgallate-a-r-rhamnoside. Additionally, six known flavonoids were isolated and identified as kaempferol (**2**) (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (**3**) (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (**4**) (Pizzolatti et al., 2003), quercetin (**5**), isoquercitrin (**6**) and rutin (**7**) (Markham et al., 1978). Their identification was based on analyses of 1H, 13C NMR and MS data, as well as by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory. Furthermore, this is the first report of flavonoid glycosides from _P. nitens_.\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of biological activities has already been demonstrated for flavonoids (Middleton et al., 2000; Cuzzocrea et al., 2001; Havsteen, 2002; Mollac et al., 2005), few studies have been devoted to the myeloperoxidase inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols (Kato et al., 2003).\n\nMyeloperoxidase production is triggered by inflammatory mediators resulting in acceleration of superoxide anion (\\(\\text{O}_{2}^{-}\\)) conversion to hydrogen peroxide an other ROS especially HOCl, which reacts further to generate singlet oxygen (\\(\\text{O}_{2}\\)) and hydroxyl radical (HO') as powerful oxidizing agents. Such species are involved in oxidative stress-related diseases as atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer disease etc., which evidences the importance of research towards new MPO inhibitors.\n\nAll isolates were assayed for their MPO inhibitory activity (Table 2), evidencing a key role of the B ring oxygenation pattern on the level of activity. Compounds **5**-**7**, presenting a catechol derived B-ring, exhibited IC50 values of 1.22, 3.75 and 3.60 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds **1**-**4**, which are kaempferol derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. The aglycone quercetin (**5**) was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003) and presented higher activity than its glucosides isoquercitrin (**6**) and rutin (**7**), suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-3 for enhancement of the MPO inhibitory activity. This trend has also been observed for kaempferol derivatives **1**-**4**, as the glucosides pterogynoside **(**1**), afzelin (**3**) and kaempferitrin (**4**) exhibited IC50 values of 10.3, 13.9 and 15.8 nM, respectively, and were less active than the aglycone kaempferol (**2**, IC50 8.3 nM). These results indicate a clear positive correlation between MPO inhibitory activity and antioxidant properties of flavonoids as shown in Table 2. The catechol on B ring and the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moieties have been extensively pointed out as the main features in flavonoids associated with enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant activity (Van Acker et al., 1996). The presence of a galloyl group, e.g. in flavonoids, has also been associated with increased antioxidant capacity (Heijnen et al., 2002). In this respect, the presence of an additional galloyl unit in compound **1** might explain its higher MPO inhibitory activity, when compared with compounds **3** and **4**.\n\nThe antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay. Quercetin derivatives **5**-**7** showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with values of IC50 (ug/mL) of 4.12, 4.37 and 4.85, and DPPH with values of 2.60, 2.77 and 3.15, respectively, than kaempferol derivatives **1**-**4** (Table 2), indicating a major role of the catechol moiety on the B-ring\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} Compound & MPO inhibition & Free radical scavenging activity \\\\ IC50 (nM)a & ABTS IC50 (μg/mL)a & DPPH IC50 (μg/mL)a \\\\ \\hline Pterogynoside (**1**) & 10.3 ± 0.03 & 8.10 ± 0.1 & \\textgreater{}80.0 \\\\ Kaempferol (**2**) & 8.30 ± 0.03 & 18.0 ± 0.5 & 17.8 ± 0.8 \\\\ Afzelin (**3**) & 13.9 ± 0.04 & 17.0 ± 0.7 & \\textgreater{}80.0 \\\\ Kaempferitrin (**4**) & 15.8 ± 0.05 & 18.5 ± 0.2 & 55.8 ± 0.8 \\\\ Quercetin (\\(\\text{S}^{\\text{b}}\\)) & 1.22 ± 0.01 & 4.12 ± 0.2 & 2.60 ± 0.1 \\\\ Isoquercitrin (**6**) & 3.75 ± 0.02 & 4.37 ± 0.2 & 2.77 ± 0.4 \\\\ Rutin (**7**) & 3.60 ± 0.02 & 4.85 ± 0.2 & 3.15 ± 0.3 \\\\ Trolox® & – & 0.63 ± 0.3 & 4.72 ± 0.4 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory activity and free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) towards ABTS and DPPH of flavonoids **1**-**7**\n\n## Page 4\n\nof flavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among compounds **1**-**4**, increasing activities were observed for pterogynoside (**1**) and kaempferol (**2**), which confirms the importance of the free hydroxyl groups on C-3 (in **2**) and the enhancement of RSA due to the galloyl group (in **1**) in both assays. Among compounds **5**-**7**, quercetin (**5**) exhibited higher activity than its 3-_O_-glucosyl derivatives **6** and **7**, which confirmed the influence of the free-hydroxy group at C-3 for potentiating the free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids.\n\n## 3 Concluding remarks\n\nIn summary, flavonoids with either the catechol moiety or a,b-unsaturated carbonyl with the free hydroxyl group at C-3 have shown best anti-radicalar and MPO inhibitory properties, which corroborates the involvement of MPO in redox processes. The absence of such features in pterogynoside (**1**) has been counteracted by the galloyl moiety on C-3'' leading to MPO inhibitory activity comparable to kaempferol (**2**), and higher free radical scavenging ability than **2** or its glucosides **3** and **4**.\n\nFlavonols from _P. nitens_ presented potent inhibition towards the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase and potent radical scavenging effects, which may be particularly important because they are easily available in the plant kingdom (Middleton et al., 2000) and are able to protect biological systems against stress phenomena such as lipid peroxidation, as shown for a variety of kaempferol derivatives exhibiting high antioxidant selectivity (Gebre-Mariam et al., 2005), and for quercetin and its derivatives, which have been shown to protect cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and calcium dysregulation (Wang and Joseph, 1999).\n\n## 4 Experimental\n\n### General methods\n\nMelting points were recorded on a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melting point apparatus. The 1D - (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D - (1H - 1H _g_COSY, _g_HMQC and _g_HMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 126 MHz (13C), using the solvents as an internal standard. Negative-ion high resolution mass spectra were recorded on HRMS ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF instrument (Bruker Dallocnics). IR spectra absorptions were measured on a Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr discs, whereas UV spectra were acquired on a Perkin Elmer UV-vis Lambda 14P spectrophotometer. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and pre-coated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde-hyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Preparative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden. All enzymatic or scavenging free radical assays were performed using a Spectrophotometer HP 8543, Diode Array. Guaiacol, ABTS [2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were purchased from Sigma Chemical(r). All other reagents were analytical grade and commercially available. MPO was purchased from Planta Natural Products(r).\n\n### Plant material\n\nFruits of _P. nitens_ were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A voucher specimen **(SP204319)** has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sao Paulo State, Brazil).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe shade-dried fruits (2 kg) of _P. nitens_ were ground and defatted with _n_-hexane (15 L x 5, at room temperature, for two weeks) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with EtOH (25 L x 5) at room temperature. The combined ethanol extracts were concentrated in vacuo (< 40 degC) to yield 8.0 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH:H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and _n_-BuOH. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.5 and 3.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue was subjected to silica gel (230-400 mesh) CC eluted with EtOAc/MeOH gradient (0-100% MeOH) to afford eight fractions (E1-E8) and free aglycones **2** (220.9 mg) and **5** (150.8 mg). Fraction E6 (397.8 mg) was further purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH:-H2O:AcOH (58:42:0.1), UV detection at 254 nm; flow rate 10 mL/min], affording acylated flavonoid **1** (115.9 mg) and two flavonol monoglycosides **3** (82.9 mg) and **6** (78.7 mg).\n\nThe _n_-BuoH residue was dissolved into MeOH and submitted to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 23 fractions (B1-B23). After TLC comparison, fractions B12-B19 were combined (488.3 mg) and purified by RP-HPLC using MeOH:H2O:AcOH (68:32:0.1) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 254 nm and flow rate of 12 mL/min, affording flavonol glycosides **4** (150.7 mg) and **7** (299.0 mg).\n\n### Kaempferol-3-O-(3''-O-4''-methyl[gallate-a-L-rhamnoside) (1)\n\nYellowish prisms (MeOH); m.p. 272-273 degC; [a]22 - 131 (MeOH, \\(c\\), 1.0); UV (EtOH) _l_max (log_c_); 316 (4.53), 297\n\n## Page 5\n\n(4.29).

For \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR (500 MHz, CD\\({}_{3}\\)OD) and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR (126 MHz, CD\\({}_{3}\\)OD) spectroscopic data, see Table 1.\n\n### Assay for MPO inhibitory activity\n\nMPO inhibitory effects of flavonols **1**-**7 were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM). The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample concentrations of compounds **1**-**7 (0.50-50 nM) and in the their absence (Kato et al., 2003). The IC\\({}_{50}\\) values were calculated from the rates calculated on the basis of inhibition percentage expressed in concentration-response curves.\n\n### Evaluation of radical scavenging activity (RSA)\n\nRadical scavenging activity (RSA) of compounds **1**-**7 was determined using DPPH\\({}^{*}\\) (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS\\({}^{+}\\) [2,2\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as reagents. Sample solutions of **1**-**7 and Trolox\\({}^{\\circledR}\\) at various concentrations (10-100 mg/ml) in EtOH were individually added to 0.6 mM DPPH in EtOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 30 min (Soares et al., 1997; Duarte-Almeida et al., 2006). Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 531 nm by blanking against absolute ethanol. ABTS\\({}^{+}\\) was prepared by reacting 5 mL of ABTS (7 mM) water soln. with 88 mL of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12-16 h before use. Prior to assay ABTS\\({}^{+}\\) stock soln. was diluted with KH\\({}_{2}\\)PO\\({}_{4}\\)/K\\({}_{2}\\)HPO\\({}_{4}\\) (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buffer soln. (ratio 1:88). One milliliter ABTS\\({}^{+}\\) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compound **1** and Trolox\\({}^{\\circledR}\\) (0.5-7.0 mg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging activity (Pellegrini et al., 1999). Anti-radical abilities against ABTS\\({}^{+}\\) and DPPH' species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (inhibition\\(\\%\\)) calculated from the equation: Inhibition \\(\\%=[1-(A_{\\rm sample}/A)\\times 100]\\), where \\(A\\) is test absorbance without sample (only solvent and free radicals) and \\(A_{\\rm sample}\\) is test absorbance with compounds **1**-**7 or Trolox\\({}^{\\circledR}\\).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was funded by grants from the \"Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo\", FAPESP (Brazil), as part of the Biota-FAPESP - The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biotasp.org.br); Grant No. 03/021767-7 awarded to Dr. Bolzani, principal investigator.

Additionally, two known compounds, (_R_)-7-hydroxymellein (**2**) and (_3_R_AR_)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**), were isolated from _Penicillium_ sp. associated to _Alibertia macrophylla_ (Rubiaceae). The structures of all compounds were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data. The dihydrocoumarin derivatives **1**-3** showed antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities _in vitro_.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFungal endophytes comprise a wide range of fungi characterized by the ability to live for a certain period of their life-cycles internally and asymptomatically in plants (Wang et al., 2007). Such co-existence may confer adaptative advantages to the plant host, such as feeding deterrence, protection against insects and microbial pathogens (De Souza et al., 2004). Considering that chemical clues are usually involved in these biological interactions, natural products from endophytic fungi very often present a broad spectrum of biological activities (Zhang et al., 2006).\n\nIsocoumarins are metabolites of limited distribution, which occur in bacteria, fungi and lichen (Kutschera et al., 2003). These compounds have also been detected in secretions of termites and ants (Engelmeier et al., 2004). Several biological activities have been reported for this class, including cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antialergized, aljcidal, gastroprotective, protease inhibitory, antifungal (Ozcan et al., 2007; Krohn et al., 1997; Guimaraes et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009) as well as plant growth regulators (Kuramata et al., 2007).\n\nThe Brazilian cerrado trees are well known sources of bioactive secondary metabolites (Bolzani et al., 1991; Young et al., 1992; Silva et al., 2007, 2010). Among these, _A. macrophylla_ K. Schum (Rubiaceae) and _P. aduncum_ L. (Pieraceae) were chosen for a detailed microbiological investigation. These plants presented several endophytes, including _Penicillium_ and _Xylaria_ species, which were submitted to chemical and biological investigations.\n\nHerein, we report the isolation and biological activities of one new dihydroisocoumarin, (3_R_AR_)-3.4-dihydro-4,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid (**1**) and two known dihydroisocoumarins, (_R_)-7-hydroxymellein (**2**) and (3_R_AR_)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**). (3_R_AR_)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**) (Fig. 1).\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as yellow amorphous powder, and showed a positive reaction with ferric chloride suggesting the presence of a phenol functionality. The IR spectrum of **1** showed strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (3474 cm-1) and a conjugated carbonyl group (1672 cm-1). The UV spectrum of **1** displayed absorptions (lmax) (log e) at 220 (4.28) and 314 (3.34), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a dihydroisocoumarin structure (Pontius et al., 2008). Its elemental composition C11H10O6 with seven degrees of insaturation was deduced from its HRESIMs, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([M-H]) at m/22 370.0381 (caled for C11H9O6, 237.0399), consistent with its 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Extensive analysis of 1H-1H gCOSY, 1H-13C gHMQC, and 1H-13C\n\n## Page 2\n\ngHMBC NMR experiments enabled us to assign all \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C signals. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR, DEPT 90', and \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C gHMQC indicated that compound **1** had one methyl, four methines, and six quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 169.5 and \\(\\delta\\) 167.1, assigned to a carboxyl and to a 8-lactone groups, respectively. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR and \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)Hg gCOSY spectra of **1** showed two ortho-coupled hydrogens at \\(\\delta\\) 7.04 (H-8) and \\(\\delta\\) 8.10 (H-9), suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)Hg gCOSY spectrum indicated a spin system in **1** which included a methyl group at \\(\\delta\\) 1.43 (H\\({}_{3}\\)C-10) coupled with an oxymentine hydrogen at \\(\\delta\\) 4.72 (H-3), itself coupled with a methine hydrogen at \\(\\delta\\) 5.47 (H-4). Therefore, the aliphatic portion of **1** was unambiguously established as a H\\({}_{3}\\)C-CH(0-)CH-OH chain. Long-range correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum between H-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 7.04) with C-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 163.9), C-5 (\\(\\delta\\) 108.7), and C-8a (\\(\\delta\\) 120.0), between H-4 (\\(\\delta\\) 5.47) with C-4a (\\(\\delta\\) 144.8), C-5, C-8a and C-3 (\\(\\delta\\) 78.2), as well as between H-8 (\\(\\delta\\) 8.10) with C-6, C-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 167.1) and C-4a enabled us to establish unequivocally the substitution pattern of the aromatic moiety of **1**. A logical deduction of the data collected would obviously lead to the structure **1**. Since H-3 and H-4 showed a coupling constant of 1.8 Hz, these protons had an axial-equatorial relationship. Thus, the relative stereochemistry of compound **1** was established as (3_R_*, 4_R_*). This relative configuration at C-3 and C-4 was very similar when compared with data of similar isochronames (Okuno et al., 1986; Aldridge et al., 1971). A comparison of the optical rotation of **1** ([**_a_**]\\({}^{28}\\) -60.3, \\(c\\) 0.034, MeOH) with the literature values reported for three of the four possible 4-hydroxymellein stereoisomers (Devys et al., 1980) indicated that (3_R_*,4_R_*)-4-hydroxymellein has both the signal and magnitude of optical rotation ([**_a_**]\\({}_{0}\\) -1.5) comparable to compound **1**. Therefore, the absolute configuration of **1** was assigned as (3_R_*,4_R_*) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Hence, the structure of compound **1** was completely elucidated, and established as (3_R_*,4_R_*)-3.4-dihydro-4.6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid.\n\nIn addition, two known dihydroisocoumarins were isolated from a _Penicillin_ sp. and identified as (_R_*)-7-hydroxymethylein (**2**) and (3_R_*,4_R_*)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Compounds **2** and **3** were identified by analysis of spectroscopic data, as well as of optical rotation data, with literature values. Both **2** and **3** exhibited a rare 7.8-dihydroxy substitution. To date, related compounds have been isolated from plant and fungi sources, including _Azadifractha indica_, _Seporia nodorum_, _Cytospora euclypticola_, _Nodulisporum_ sp. and _Cephalosporium_ sp. (Devys et al., 1980; Siddiqui et al., 1988; Kokubun et al., 2003; Bi et al., 2006; Pontius et al., 2008). The cathecol moiety of **2** and **3** is probably formed after an additional oxidation at C-7, subsequently to the formation of the aromatic polyketide skeleton.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\ngel 230-400 mesh (Merck). IR spectra were obtained with PerkinElmer FTIR-1600 spectrophotometer, on KBr pellets. Optical rotations were measured with PerkinElmer polarimeter with sodium lamp operating at 589 nm at 28 degC.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _A. macrophylla_ K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) and _P. aduncum_ L. (Pieraceae) were collected in \"Estacao Ecologica Experimental de Mogi-Guacu, Fazenda Campininha\", Mogi-Guacu, S3o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identifications were assigned by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, Brazil (Voucher no. SP 370915 and Cordeiro PAO, respectively).\n\n### Isolation and identification of the endophytes\n\nAdult and healthy leaves of _P. aduncum_ and _A. macrophylla_ were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. Leaves were first washed with water and soap, then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and in 70% aqueous EtOH for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and finally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 x 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate (50 mg/mL), 3-4 pieces on each dish. The material of the two species was incubated at 25 degC for 10 days and the endophytes _Penicillium_ sp. and _Xylaria_ sp. were isolated by successive inoculation in Petri dishes from _Alibertia macrophyla_ and _P. aduncum_, respectively (Silva et al., 2006).\n\nThe fungus _Penicillium_ sp. was identified by Dr. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP - Centro Pluridiscipliner et Pesquisas Quimicas, Biologicas e Agricolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number 05070032-C. The fungus _Xylaria_ sp. was identified by Prof. Dr. Ludwing H. Pfenning (Universidade Federal de Lavras, Departamento de Fitopatologia) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number PA-01.\n\n### Growth of Xylaria sp. and extraction\n\nThe strain was inoculated in twenty Erlenmeyers (500 mL each) containing each one: 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose (PDB) in 300 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved at 121 degC for 15 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, for 28 days. The mycelia biomass accumulated in the Erlenmeyers was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration, and the filtrate was subjected to a liquid-liquid partition with EtOAC (3 x 2 L). The EtOAc fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g).\n\n#### Extraction and isolation of compound 1\n\nThe crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g) was purified by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting with MeOH, to afford 08 fractions (F-1-F-8, 100 mL portions). Compound **1** (175.0 mg) was obtained from fractions F-6 to F-7 as a yellow amorphous powder.\n\n### Growth of Penicillium sp. and growth medium extraction\n\nThe _Penicillium_ sp. strain was inoculated in nine Erlenmeyers (500 mL each), containing each one: 90 g of corn meal in 75 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 degC for 40 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC in still mode during 21 days. At the end of the growth period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6x 250 mL). The MeOH was evaporated, to give 15 g of the MeOH extract. The MeOH extract was dissolved in McN and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with hexane. The McN fraction was evaporated to give 6.0 g of a McN-deffated extract.\n\n#### Extraction and Isolation of compounds 2 and 3\n\nThe McN-deffated fraction obtained (6.0 g) was fractionated using a C18 reversed-phase CC, eluted with a gradient of MeOH in H2O (5-100% MeOH), to afford 16 fractions (Fri-Fri-Fri16). Fraction Fri-2 (218.0 mg) was further separated using RP-HPLC [l = 254 nm, 10.0 ml/ml, 8:2 H2O-McN (80 min)], to give compounds **2** (6.3 mg, _R_** = 40.3 min) and **3** (6.1 mg, _R_** = 30.0 min).\n\n_(3_R_**,_**\n\n## Page 4\n\nsee Table 2; HRESI-MS (negative ion): _m_/_z_ 209.0485 [M - H]- (caled for C10H10O5, 209.0459).\n\n### Antifungal activity\n\n_Cidasopporum cladosoprioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. _spherosperimum_ (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. Compounds **1**-**3** were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.00 and 1.00 mg samples of pure compounds. After eluting with CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the plates were sprayed with the fungi suspension (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was used as a positive control at 1.0 mg.\n\n### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity\n\nAcetylcholinesterase (1000 U) was dissolved in 150 mL of 0.05 M Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer at pH 7.8. Bovine serum albumin (150 mg) was added to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 degC. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol) in order to clean the plates before drying at 30 degC. After elution of samples in CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the TLC plates were dried at 30 degC for complete removal of solvent. The plates were then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and carefully dried at r.t. again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was deposited flat over plastic plugs in a covered plastic tank containing a small amount of H2O, in order to keep the humidity constant. The incubation of plates was performed at 37 degC for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple coloration after 1-2 min (if positive). Galantamine was employed as positive control 1.0 mg (Marston et al., 2002).\n\n## References\n\n- Aldridge, C.C., Galt, S., Giles, D., Turner, W.B., 1971. Metabolites of _Lasiodiophodia theobromane_.

In the present work, the cytotoxicity of pristimerin was evaluated in human tumor cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This work also examined the effects of pristimerin (0.4; 0.8 and 1.7 uM) in HL-60 cells, after 6, 12 and 24 h of exposure. Pristimerin reduced the number of viable cells and increased number of non-viable cells in a concentration-dependent manner by tripan blue test showing morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. Nevertheless, pristimerin was not selective to cancer cells, since it inhibited PBMC proliferation with an IC50 of 0.88 uM. DNA synthesis inhibition assessed by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in HL-60 cells was 70% and 83% for the concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 uM, respectively. Pristimerin (10 and 20 uM) was not able to inhibit topoisomerase I. In AO/EB (acridine orange/ethidium bromide) staining, all tested concentrations reduced the number of HL-60 viable cells, with the occurrence of necrosis and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, results in agreement with trypan blue exclusion findings. The analysis of membrane integrity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry in the presence of pristimerin indicated that treated cells underwent apoptosis. The present data point to the importance of pristimerin as representative of an emerging class of potential anticancer chemicals, exhibiting an antiproliferative effect by inhibiting DNA synthesis and triggering apoptosis.\n\nP ristimerin; Apoptosis; Antileukemic +\nFootnote †: journal: Apoptosis; Antileukemic\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide after cardiovascular diseases. Despite many therapeutic advances, mortality is still unacceptably high (Reddy et al., 2003). Most of the drugs used today in the clinic were first discovered from plants and microorganisms (Mann, 2002). Thus, natural products continue to perform an essential role in the search for new anti-cancer molecules.\n\nChemical studies carried out on Celastraceae species have revealed the occurrence of phenolic metabolites, such as condensed tannins (Gonzalez et al., 1982), flavonoids (Corsino et al., 2003) and quinone-methide triterpenes (Corsino et al., 2000; Buffa Filho et al., 2002a,b; Carvalho et al., 2005). The quinone-methide triterpenoids of the Celastraceae family have a variety of biological activities, such as \n\n## Page 2\n\nantimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971), antioxidant (Jeller et al., 2004; Carvalho et al., 2005) and antimalarial (Figueiredo et al., 1998).\n\n_Maytenus licifolia_ Martius (Celastaceae) is popularly known as \"espinheira santa\", being well known for alleviating stomach pain, nausea and treating ulcers and gastritis (Camparoto et al., 2002). _In vivo_ studies have proved the effectiveness of _M. licifolia_ in ethanol- and/or indomethacin-induced gastric lesion models (Bersani-Amado et al., 2000).\n\nPristimerin (Fig. 1) (20a-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-24-_nor_-frie-dela-1-10,3,5,7-tetraen-carboxylic acid-29-methylester) is a quinone methidte triterpenoid, which in nature is restricted to the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families (Dirsch et al., 1997). Dirsch et al. (1997) demonstrated that pristimerin inhibits the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by a mechanism that involves inhibition of NFKB activation, thereby contributing to its anti-inflammatory activity.\n\nIt is also known that pristimerin exhibits cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines (Chang et al., 2003). However, the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect of pristimerin has not been completely explored. In 2005, Wu et al. (2005), observed that human breast cancer cells (MDA/MB-231) treated with pristimerin showed the release of cytochrome \\(c\\) from mitochondria and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential leading to apoptosis. More recently, Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated that pristimerin induces death of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) by its potent proteasomal inhibition.\n\nAlthough this compound has a variety of reported biological activities, the effect of pristimerin on human leukemia cell lines and the underlying mechanism of action have never been investigated. In this way, the aim of the present work was to determine the antiproliferative effects of pristimerin on different human cancer cell lines and in peripheral blood monocluear cells (PBMC). Its mechanism of action was also evaluated in leukemia cancer cell line HL-60.\n\n## Material and methods\n\n### Extraction and isolation of pristimerin\n\nDried and powdered root bark of _M. licifolia_ (900.0 g) was extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a brown gum (606.0 g), which was submitted to liquid-liquid partitioning. The CH2Cl2 soluble part of the EtOH extract was concentrated in vacuo (121.0 g), submitted to a silica gel column chromatography (700 g, 70-230 mesh) with hexane/EtOAc gradient elution, yielding 43 fractions (A1-A43). Fraction A10-A14 (2.88 g) was submitted to flash silica gel column chromatography (230-400 mesh) with hexane/EtOAc gradient elution, resulting in 38 fractions (B1-B38). Fraction B12-B14 (0.609 g) was submitted to preparatory reverse phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), \\(\\gamma = 420\\,\\text{nm}\\), 10 mL/min] to afford pristimerin (retention time = 21.0 min; 0.310 g; MW = 464.6).\n\n### Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines\n\nThe cytotoxic potential of pristimerin was evaluated by the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983), against five human tumor cell lines: HL-60 (bromylocytotic leukemia), K-562 (chronic myelocytic leukemia), SF-295 (glycolastoma), HCT-8 (colon cancer) and MDA/MB-435 (melanoma), all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, at 37 degC with 5% CO2. Tumor cell growth was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetra-zolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product (Mosmann, 1983). Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.7 x 105 cells/well for adherent cells and 0.3 x 105 cells/well for suspended cells) and pristimerin (0.08-53.7 mM) dissolved in DMSO 1% was added to each well. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL). Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 mL DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter(r)). Doxorubicin was used as positive control. The cytotoxicity of pristimerin was also evaluated after 24 h of incubation in order to establish the concentrations for the studies in HL-60 cells.\n\n### Inhibition of PBMC proliferation - Alamar Blue assay\n\nIn order to investigate the selectivity of pristimerin toward a normal proliferating cell, the Alamar Blue assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug exposure. Heparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug at least 15 days prior to sampling) was collected and\n\nFig. 1: Structure of pristimerin isolated from _M. licifolia_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nPBMC were isolated by a standard method of density-gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 3 x 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 degC with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (3%) was added at the beginning of culture. After 24 h, the compound (0.08-53.7 mM) dissolved in DMSO 1% were added to each well and incubated for 72 h. Doxorubicin (0.02-8.6 mM) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incubation, 10 mL of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of the Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma-Aldrich Co) was added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiple reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter(r)) and the drug effect was quantified as the percentage of control absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of the medium is also measured at the higher and lower wavelengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOLW. A correction factor \\(R\\)0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOLW, where \\(R\\)0 = AOLW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced then is expressed as follows: \\(\\%\\) reduced = _A_LW-(_A_HW x \\(R\\)0) x 100.\n\n### Study of the mechanism involved in the leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity\n\nThe following experiments were performed in order to investigate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect of pristimerin against HL-60 cells using a 24 h exposure. Pristimerin dissolved in sterilized DMSO (vehicle control) was added to cell cultures of HL-60 cells (3 x 105 cells/ mL) to obtain final concentrations of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 mM, corresponding to IC50/2, IC50 and two times IC50 values obtained by the MTT assay after 24 h of incubation. Doxorubicin (0.6 mM) was used as a positive control.\n\n#### Trypan blue exclusion\n\nCell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (Renzi et al., 1993) after incubation of HL-60 cells with pristimerin. Aliquots from wells were removed from cultures after 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber.\n\n#### Inhibition of DNA synthesis\n\nHL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with pristimerin. Before the end of a 24 h drug exposure, 20 mL of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37 degC. To determine the amount of BrdU incorporated into DNA (Pera et al., 1977), cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and coverslipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was performed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per sample to determine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells.\n\n#### DNA relaxation assay\n\nThe inhibitory effects of pristimerin (10 and 20 mM) on human Topo I were measured using Topo I Drug Screening Kit (TopoGEN, Inc.). Supercoiled (Form I) plasmid DNA (250 ng) was incubated with human Topo I (4 units) at 37 degC for 30 min in relaxation buffer (10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine and 5% glycerol) in the absence or presence of 10 and 20 mM pristimerin (final 20 mL). Campothecin (0.1 mM) was used as positive control. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10% SDS (2 mL). Proteinase K (50 mg/mL) was added and incubated at 37 degC for 30 min. DNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel for 120 min at room temperature, and visualized with ethidium bromide.\n\n#### Analysis of morphological changes\n\nUntreated or pristimerin-treated HL-60 cells were examined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metr-imper Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar lab(r)). To evaluate morphology, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, fixed with ethanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H/E). Doxorubicin (0.6 mM) was used as a positive control.\n\n#### Morphological analysis with fluorescence microscopy\n\nAcridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining (McGahon et al., 1995) of HL-60 cells was performed to evaluate the cell death pattern induced by increasing concentrations of pristimerin. Doxorubicin (0.6 mM) was used as a positive control. After 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted and each sample was mixed with 1 mL of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 mg/mL of AO in PBS; 100 mg/mL EB in PBS) just prior to fluorescence microscopy and quantification (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hundred cells were counted per sample and scored as follows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells (Geng et al., 2003; Cury-Boaventura et al., 2004).\n\n#### Flow cytometry analysis\n\n##### Cell membrane integrity\n\nHL-60 cell membrane integrity was evaluated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 mg/mL). Cell fluorescence was then determined by flow cytometry in a Guava EasyCytre Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were \n\n## Page 4\n\nevaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis.\n\n#### 2.4.6.2 Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation\n\nHL-60 cells were incubated at 25 degC for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 mg/mL propidium iodide. Cell fluorescence was then determined by flow cytometry in a Guava EasyCytre Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nFor cytotoxicity assays, the IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Graphpad program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). In order to determine differences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls test (_P_ < 0.01).\n\n## Results\n\n### Cytotoxicity assays\n\nThe MTT analysis showed that pristimerin exhibited cytotoxic activity against all five cancer cell lines. Based on data collected from two independent experiments carried out in triplicate, the IC50 values ranged from 0.55 to 3.2 mM in MDA/MB-435 and K-562, respectively, after 72 h of incubation with pristimerin (Table 1). The IC50 values obtained in PBMC for pristimerin and doxorubicin were 0.88 (0.75-1.03) and 1.66 (0.89-3.10) mM, respectively, also after 72 h of incubation.\n\nAll subsequent experiments were conducted on HL-60 cell lines to determine the mechanism of action of pristimerin in this cell line.\n\n### Pristimerin reduces cell viability and inhibits DNA synthesis\n\nPristimerin produced a significant decrease (_P_ < 0.01) in cell viability and increased number of non-viable cells as soon as 6 h exposure, which occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). To further understand the antiproliferative activity, the incorporation of the nucleoside BrdU into DNA was measured by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry assay. In Fig. 3, we can see that HL-60 cells treated by pristimerin showed about 30% and 17% of BrdU incorporation at the concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 mM, respectively (_P_ < 0.01), while doxorubicin (0.6 mM) lead to 24% of incorporation. BrdU positive cells in control correspond to 65%. Since pristimerin was able to inhibit DNA synthesis, it could be a suitable candidate to cause inhibition of topoisomerase. However, pristimerin (10 and 20 mM) did not show any effect in the DNA relaxation assay (data not shown).\n\n### Pristimerin alters cell morphology\n\nAnalysis by H/E of HL-60 treated and untreated cells revealed several drug-induced morphological changes. Control cells exhibited a typical non-adherent and vacuolization round morphology after 24 h in culture (Fig. 4A). The cells treated at all concentrations showed a progressive DNA fragmentation, a reduction in cell volume and destabilization of the plasma membrane, indicating an increasing progression toward cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C-E). Pyknotic nuclei were observed at higher doses as early as 6 h of treatment. Doxorubicin (0.6 mM) also induced reduction in cell volume, besides nuclear fragmentation and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B).\n\n### Pristimerin induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells\n\nTo further determine whether the growth-inhibitory effect of pristimerin was related to the induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/EB staining by fluorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment with the compound, a decreasing number of viable cells (Fig. 5A) and an increasing number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 5B) were observed in a dose-dependent manner. As early as 6 h of pristimerin (0.4 mM) exposure (_P_ < 0.01), apoptosis was observed. Regarding necrosis, a significant increase was seen at 0.8 mM after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 5C), while extensive cell damage indicative of necrosis occurred only at 1.7 mM after 24 h (_P_ < 0.01).\n\n### Pristimerin disrupts cell membrane integrity\n\nThe propidium iodide intercalation test showed that pristimerin caused disruption of the cell membrane in HL-60 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The results revealed a significant reduction in cell viability starting at 0.8 mM\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} Substance & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{CI50 (μg/ml (μM))a  \\\\ HL-60 & K-562 & MDA/MB-435 & SF-295 & HCT-8 \\\\ Doxorubicin & 0.02 & 0.14 & 0.48 (0.83) & 0.23 & 0.01 \\\\  & (0.04) & (0.24) & (0.40) & (0.02) \\\\  & 0.01–02 & 0.09–23 & 0.34–0.66 & 0.19–0.25 & 0.01–0.02 \\\\ Pristimerin & 0.61 & 1.49 & 0.26 (0.55) & 0.57 & 0.69 \\\\  & (1.31) & (3.20) & (1.22) & (1.48) \\\\  & 0.56–1.17– & 0.20–0.34 & 0.38–0.59–0.67 & 0.67 & 0.85 & 0.82 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Cytotoxic activity of pristimerin in tumor cell lines\n\n## Page 5\n\nafter 12 h and 24 h exposure with percent inhibition values of 18% and 25%, respectively. This activity was also shown to be dependent on time exposure (_P_ < 0.01) (Fig. 4A).\n\n### Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation\n\nInternucleosomal DNA fragmentation was examined by flow cytometry in HL-60 cells. All DNA that was sub-diploid in size was considered fragmented. All concentrations of pristimerin tested led to a significant increase in DNA fragmentation (_P_ < 0.01) in a time- and dose-dependent way. After 12 h of exposure, pristimerin at all concentrations produced a peak of DNA fragmentation (38.43%, 68.23% and 79% for 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 mM, respectively) (Fig. 6B).\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\nVarious compounds derived from plant secondary metabolites are commonly used in cancer chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, camptothecin and tenoposide. Chemotherapy has been improved over the past years, but until now, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, mainly because of side effects or multi-drug resistance. Moreover, it is important to find new molecules with activity against cancer with more specific effects (Kamb, 2005). In this context, many researches have found bioactive metabolites in plants of the Celastraceae family with antitumor (quinon-emethole triterpens) and cytotoxic (triterpene dimers) activities (Shirota et al., 1994), which makes these compounds promising new anti-cancer drug candidates.\n\nIn this work, we investigated the effect of pristimerin isolated from _M. licifolia_ in five human tumor cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, SF-295, MDA/MB-435 and K-562) and in normal proliferating PBMC. The underlying mechanism of\n\nFig. 3: BrdU (5-bromo-2′deoxyuridine) incorporation by HL-60 cells treated with pristimerin 0.4 and 0.8 mM after 24 h of incubation.

In the first part of this study, pristimerin showed high cytotoxicity against all cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.55 uM (MDA/MB-435) to 3.2 uM (K-562) after 72 h. Goncalves de Lima et al. (1971) and Setzer et al. (1998) also demonstrated that quinonomethide triterpenoids isolated from the Celastracee family inhibits cell growth. Our study also corroborates the findings of Wu et al. (2005) showing that pristimerin inhibits cell growth of cancer cell lines: A-549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) and HepG3B (liver) with IC50 values ranging from 0.42 to 0.61 uM. In the present work, we also demonstrated that pristimerin was cytotoxic to PBMC in the same concentration range than to leukemia cells, suggesting a poor selectivity of this compound. When considering the chemotherapy side effects, it is very important to verify whether the drug shows a harmful effect against normal dividing cells such as proliferating lymphocytes (Zuco et al., 2002; Anazetti et al., 2003).\n\nMammalian cells provide an excellent tool for studying cytotoxic substances, where the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line is one of the most often used model for this purpose (Collins, 1987; Militao et al., 2006).

At all concentrations tested, pristimerin-in reduced the number of viable cells, which was more evident at higher concentrations (0.8 and 1.7 mM). These results are consistent with the MTT findings and flow cytometry.\n\nThe antiproliferative effects were further investigated to determine the mechanism underlying pristimerin cytotoxicity. DNA synthesis was affected by treatment with pristimerin at all concentrations in a dose-dependent way, with extensive cell destruction at 1.7 mM, which made quantification difficult. Current cancer chemotherapy drugs such as intercalating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors can inhibit DNA synthesis. This inhibition can be due to several cellular processes such as DNA topology state. Moreover, topoisomerase plays an important role by altering the topological state of DNA in events such as overwinding, underwinding, and catenation, and it is involved in proliferative processes such as DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and chromosome segregation. We investigated the effect of pristimerin on topoisomerase I activity, since this enzyme can be a primordial target for the action\n\nFig. 5: Effect of pristimerin on HL-60 cell death pattern determined by acridine orange and ethidium bromide-staining (AO/EB) after 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation.

However, pristimerin was not able to inhibit human topoisomerase I activity indicating that the antiproliferative mechanism of pristimerin is probably due to alterations in another pathway.\n\nIn order to determine the mechanism of cell death, alterations in cell morphology were examined. Some authors have considered the distinction between apoptosis and necrosis difficult and controversial. According to Masquelier et al. (2004), the morphological definition is commonly based on membrane integrity. Dartsch et al. (2002) and Schultz and Harrington (2003) considered crucial points for distinguishing apoptosis from necrosis: an early occurrence of nuclear and DNA fragmentation concomitant with membrane integrity, showing apoptotic bodies, phosphatidylinositol internalization, reduction of nuclear volume and chromatin condensation. Generally, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is a great benefit for cancer chemotherapy (Reddy et al., 2003).\n\nIn the morphological studies, appreciable DNA fragmentation was observed at the all doses, with highest one revealing signs of extensive destabilization of the plasma membrane with loss of integrity, reduction of cell volume and pyknotic nuclei typical of necrotic processes (Hannun, 1997; Desoize and Sen, 1992). As seen in cytometry analysis, pristimerin induced an increase in sub-G1 population cells, which was concentration and time-dependent, suggesting that cells underwent DNA fragmentation, an important hallmark of apoptosis. Moreover, in AO/EB fluorescence experiments, pristimerin treated cells displayed characteristics of apoptosis as fragmented and condensed nuclei and a brilliant intense green fluorescence, with exception of 24 h exposure at 1.7 uM, which revealed necrosis as probably the result of late apoptosis. These findings are in agreement with those reported by Wu et al. (2005) who showed that pristimerin causes apoptosis induction in MDA/MB-231 cells triggering a rapid and time-dependent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria within 0.5 h and activation of caspase-3, acting by the intrinsic pathway.\n\nIn conclusion, the present data point to the importance of pristimerin, a quinonemethodide triterpenoid, as representa\n\nFig. 6: Flow cytometry analysis of pristimerin effects on HL-60 cells determined by propidium iodide.

It is involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among the proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, cathepsin V is a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In the present work, natural flavonoids were screened against cathepsin V, and two flavones were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. On the basis of this result, a combinatorial library of chalcones and flavones was prepared, in solution phase employing a scavenger reagent, and fully evaluated.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCoronary arterial disease is one of the major causes of human death. In this context, atherosclerosis, which is characterized by a thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall, is the leading cause of cardiac illness. Cathepsin V is a papain-like cysteine protease, involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among proteolytic enzymes.1,2 It is predominantly expressed in the thymus, testicles, and epithelial corneal. Although cathepsin V can be considered a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, few inhibitors are described in the literature.2,3\n\nThe benzopyranoene-ring system, found in flavonoids, is a molecular scaffold of considerable interest, and some reports describe this class of compounds as inhibitors of cathepsin activity. Kenyon and co-workers reported the activity of chalcone derivatives toward the enzyme cathepsin B.4,5 Patil et al. isolated a new dimeric dihydrochalcone and a premy-lated flavone from _Artocarpus altilis_ (Moraceae) which are potent inhibitors of cathepsin K, with IC50 values of 98 and 840 nM, respectively.6 Pan et al.7 and Zeng et al.8 described biflavones isolated from _Taxodium mucronatum_ (Taxodiacea) and _Cycas guizhouensis_ (Cycadaceae) with activity against cathepsin B and K. Bauvois et al. examined the effects of synthetic flavones on a number of metalloproteinases, g-glutamyl transpeptidase as well as serine proteases such as cathepsin G.9\n\nFootnote 4: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 5: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 6: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 7: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 8: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nMedicinal chemistry efforts have focused on diversifying the benzopyranone scaffold and utilizing combinatorial chemistry approaches to construct small benzopyrano libraries.10 In the literature are described several flavonoid libraries synthesized in solution phase, such as, for example, chalcones11-13 and flavones.14,15\n\nSolid-phase organic synthesis (SPOS) has long been an integral component of the synthetic repertoire employed by combinatorial chemists.16 In SPOS, solid support-bound substrates are elaborated synthetically by using an excess of reagents to drive reactions to completion. Desired products can then be isolated easily by simple filtration and removed from the support material. Previous reviews have discussed the importance of combinatorial libraries of flavonoids prepared by solid phase synthesis.17-19 Nicolaou et al. reported a solid-phase synthesis of a 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran motif employing a cycloloading strategy that relies on the use of a polystyrene-based selenenyl bromide resin.20 Haikrishnan and Showalter prepared a small library of isoflavone analogues employing a solid-supported diisopropylsilyloxy traceless linker.21 Cheng et al. prepared a small library of chalcones via parallel solid phase synthesis.22 A different strategy was employed by Yao et al. for the preparation of a flavone library.23 A functionalized flavone was prepared in solution phase by classical Claisen condensation, mixed acid nitration, and oxidative cyclization reaction with iodine-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Then, the flavone was employed as scaffold for the synthesis of a combinatorial library in solid phase. Arai et al. developed an efficient one-pot synthesis by Michael aldol reaction of chromone and flavonoid derivatives bearing heterocyclic units.24 The 2,3-heterocycle-substituted chromones were obtained in one step. Moreover, the use of substituted benzaldehydes and subsequent addition of heterocyclic aldehydes gave 3-pyridyl-substituted flavones. They have also examined these one-pot reactions in the solid phase by attaching the acetophenone derivative to (4-methoxyphenyl)-diisopropylsilylpropyl polystyrene beads.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nSPOS has many advantages but also many limiting drawbacks: it can be difficult to adapt conventional solution phase chemistry to a solid-phase format, some solid-phase reactions are significantly slower than they are when run in solution, and the progress of solid-phase reactions can be difficult to monitor.[11] An alternative is the use of polymer-supported reagents, catalysts, and cleanup agents (scavengers) which facilitate reactions of substrates in solution. For example, a solid-supported reagent can be used to drive to completion a coupling reaction between two reactive substrates, one of which is present in excess. A support-bound scavenger can then be used to remove the excess reagent, yielding pure product. Or a support-bound capture reagent can be used to remove the coupling product directly, which is then cleaved from the support.[25] Bhat et al. employed a piperazinyl Merrifield resin in the synthesis of a library of flavones.[26] Huang et al. described a solid-phase synthesis of flavones employing a Lewis acid-mediated polystyrene-supported selenium induced intramolecular cyclization of chalcones.[27] After the oxidative cleavage of selenium resin, the flavones were obtained in good overall yields and high purity.\n\nIn the present work, we describe the use of tosyl hydrazide scavenger resin in the preparation of a combinatorial library of chalcone and flavone derivatives, identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nIn an ongoing program toward the development of specific, potent inhibitors of cathepsin V enzyme, several natural products were screened. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation:\n\n\\[\\%\\;\\text{inhibition} = 100 \\times (1 - V_{t}/V_{0})\\]\n\nwhere \\(V_{i}\\) and \\(V\\)0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determined in the presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively.\n\nAmong some other active compounds, a series of flavonoids showed interesting activity at initial concentration of 25 _m_M. The most potent compounds were flavones **1** and **2** (Figure 1), isolated from _Vitex polygamma_ (Verbenaceae)[28] and _Lonchocarpus subglaucescens_ (Leguminosee),[29] respectively, with IC50 = 2.5 and 13.5 _m_M. The IC50 values correspond to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V, and were determined from collected data by non-linear regression analysis.\n\nOn the basis of these results, a small library of flavonoids was prepared in solution phase employing the Claisen\\(-\\)Schmidt condensation,[30] followed by oxidative cyclization catalyzed by I2 (Scheme 1).[31] The library components were obtained in moderate to good yields and were characterized by 1H NMR and MS. The compounds then were submitted to biochemical evaluation against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 1).\n\nIn this small series we have already identified flavone (**6d**) with a higher inhibition activity than the natural products **1**\n\nFigure 1: Natural flavonoids evaluated against cathepsin V.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nand **2**. To evaluate a larger number of flavonoids and establish some structure\\(-\\)activity relationships, a flavone library was prepared through parallel synthesis using the polystyrene-tosyrl hydrazide (PS-Ts-NHNHH2) (**7**) as a carbonyl scavenging resin.[32] Before carrying out the synthesis of the library some tests were realized to optimize the reaction conditions using the resin. The best results were obtained using 0.075 mmol of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxyacetophenone, 0.1 mmol of resin **7**, and 0.1 mmol of 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and the presence of the aldehydes was not observed. Following the reaction conditions previously tested, a library of chalcones and flavones was prepared (Scheme 2) using 4 acetophenones (**3**) (Figure 2) and 6 aldehydes (**4**) as building blocks (Figure 3). The diversity of the library was planned based on the structure of natural products **1** and **2**, which are highly oxygenated, and also on the commercial availability of reagents.\n\nThe reactions were carried out in 24 reaction vessels of a Buchi Syncore synthesizer. Initially, for the Claisen\\(-\\)Schmidt condensation, to a solution containing the acetophenone **3** and the aldehyde **4** in methanol was added an aqueous solution of 50% KOH. After 3 h at 75 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, an aqueous solution of 10% HCl was added to neutralize the mixture. Excess of aldehyde was removed from the reaction mixture by the use of resin scavenger **7** in dimethylformamide (DMF). Oxidative cyclization was carried out in DMSO at 150 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 1 h using iodine as catalyst.\n\nThirteen chalcones **5** were purified by preparative TLC and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 2). As observed before, the chalcones showed no activity. The flavones were purified by SPE or preparative TLC.

All compounds were characterized by \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR, and the spectroscopic data were compared with those reported in the literature.[33; 34; 35; 36; 37; 38; 39; 40; 41; 42; 43; 44; 45; 46; 47; 48; 49; 50; 51; 52; 53; 54; 55; 56; 57] The library components were submitted to biochemical evaluation (Table 3).\n\nThe first aspect of the validation of these results was the analysis of false positives. Depending on the assay design and detection method used for the screening assay, various artifacts can occur that lead to wrong results. Before performing the screening, all compounds were analyzed on a fluorimeter using the test conditions without the addition of the enzyme. Flavones **6a**, **6c**, **6**{_1,2_}, **6**{_2,4_}, and **6**{_4,4_} showed intrinsic fluorescence; thus, it was not possible to verify their potency as inhibitors. Compounds that inhibited more than 50% were selected for determination of IC\\({}_{50}\\) values. When diluted, flavones **6**{_1,1_}, **6**{_1,3_}, and **6**{_2,1_} showed fluorescence above the control, suggesting that at lower concentrations these compounds may cause a conformational change of the protein, and it was not possible to observe the fluorescence quenching, thus interfering with the response of the test.\n\nMost of the flavones showed significant inhibition with IC\\({}_{50}\\) values varying in the range of 0.8\\(-\\)25.1 \\(\\mu\\)M. Primary studies on the structure\\(-\\)activity relationships (SAR) of the flavonoids suggest the importance of the ring C. Interestingly the chalcones exhibited lower inhibition in a unique concentration demonstrating that cyclization to form the C ring is relevant to interaction between enzyme site and inhibitor. We also observed that among the most potent compounds, flavones **6d**, **6**{_3,1_}, and **6**{_3,2_} (IC\\({}_{50}\\) = 1.2, 0.8, and 1.6 \\(\\mu\\)M, respectively) possess one halogen (bromine or fluorine) as substituent in the A ring and methoxy groups in the C ring.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the lack of a detailed experimental enzyme\\(-\\)inhibitor complex, from the natural products screening, we have been able to identify synthetic flavones with increased potency. These results indicate the potential of this class as promising inhibitors of cathepsin V. To further investigate these results and thus generate useful data for the computer aided molecular design, modeling studies are being performed through docking protocol.\n\n## 3 Experimental Section\n\nAll commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Reagents and solvents were purified when necessary according to the usual procedures described in the literature. \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-200 (200 and 50 MHz respectively). The IR spectra refer to films and were measured on a Bomem M102 spectrometer. Mass Spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on a 0.25 \\(\\mu\\)m film of silica gel containing fluorescent indicator UV254 supported on an aluminum sheet (Sigma-Aldrich). Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 230\\(-\\)400 mesh, E. Merck). Gas chromatography was performed in a Shimadzu GC-17A with H\\({}_{2}\\) as carrier and using a DB-5 column. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was carried out using silica cartridges (Phenomenex Strata Silica SL-1, 500 mg, 6 mL).

S. Silva, Marcos Pivatto, Amanda de Rezende, Ian Castro-Gamboa, Vanderlan S. Bolzani, and Muraleedharan G. Nair\n\nInstituto de Quimica, UNESP-Sao Paulo State University, C.P. 355, CEP 14800-900, Araraquara, SP, Brazil, Departamento de Ciencias Exatas, Federal University of Alfernas, 37130-000, Alfernas, MG, Brazil, and Bioactive Natural Products and Phytochemicals, Department of Horticulture and National Food Safety and Toxicology Center, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824\n\n###### Abstract\n\nPhylochemical work in the search for bioactive metabolites from the methanolic extract of _Senna spectabilis_ green fruits led to the isolation of a new piperidine alkaloid, (+)-3-O-feruloylcassine (**1**), in addition to the known (-)-spectaline (**2**) and (-)-3- O-acetylspectaline (**3**). The isolates were submitted to in vitro evaluation of lipoperoxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and -2) inhibitory properties and showed moderate antioxidant activities (40-70%) at 100 ppm when compared to commercial standards BHT and vitamin E and moderate inhibition of COX-1 (ca. 40%) and marginal inhibition of COX-2 enzymes (<10%) at 100 ppm when compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin, rofecoxib, and celecoxib, respectively.\n\nThe chemotaxonomy of widely occurring _Senna_ and _Cassia_ (Fabaceae) species has been the subject of extensive studies, leading to reclassification of some species, including _Cassia spectabilis_.1 Both of these genera exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties and ethnomedical uses, especially those associated with inflammation.2-6 In Brazil, the tea of their crushed leaves is used to treat throat inflammation and diarrhea.7 Therefore, many plants belonging to _Senna_ and _Cassia_ species have been or are being studied for their anti-inflammatory botanical extracts or for the isolation of new metabolites with unique chemical structures, mode of action, selectivity, and/or effectiveness. Extracts of species from both genera have been investigated for anti-inflammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. For example, _Cassia italica_ is one of the most studied species due to its analgesic, antipyretic, laxative, and antitumor properties.8 Its ethanolic extract decreased the severity of rat paw edema in a potency comparable to acetylsalicylic acid and inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis by rat peritoneal leucocytes.9 An extract of _Senna dariensis_ has been used against snakebite and was highly active in the inhibition of the hemorrhagic effect of the venom from _Bothprops atrox_,10 whereas _Senna neglecta_ and _Senna alata_ have been used in southern Brazil and Thailand, respectively, to treat inflammation linked to microbial infection.11,12 _Cassia tora_ and _C. angustifolia_ leaf extracts have also shown anti-inflammatory properties using in vivo models with histamine-induced rat hind paw edema and 12-_O_-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema, respectively, whereas _C. fistula_ leaves methanolic extract was evaluated in vitro models and efficiently protected free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in model membranes and also inhibited the 5-lipoxygenase-mediated peroxidation of arachidonic acid.13-15\n\nAs part of our ongoing research on active metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of Sao Paulo State (Brazil), we have recently reported the isolation of several new piperidine alkaloids including (-)-spectaline (**2**), (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (**3**), and (+)-spectaline from leaves, flowers, and ripe fruits of _Senna spectabilis_, which showed anti-inflammatory and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties.16-18 Herein we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new piperidine alkaloid, (+)-3-O-feruloylcassine (**1**), from unripe fruits of _Senna_ (DC.) Irwin & Barneby), along with the identification of the known alkaloids **2** and **3**. In addition, we also report their free radical scavenging potential toward DPPH, lipoperoxidation (LPO), and cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitory activities.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a pale yellow solid (mp 7-74 \\(\\U\\)C). HRESIMS and elemental analysis of **1** indicated the molecular formula C23H43NO3, with eight degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum suggested the presence of secondary amine (3413, 1514 cm-1), ketone (1710 cm-1), and olefinic (3050, 1629, 1529 cm-1) moieties. The 'H NMR spectroscopic signals for two vital olefinic methines at d 7.68 (d, \\(J\\) = 15.5 Hz, H-7 ) and d 6.36 (d, \\(J\\) = 15.5 Hz, H-8 ) with a _trans_ relative configuration, three aromatic methanes at d 7.06 (brs, H-2 ), d 7.00 (d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-6 ), and d 6.82 (d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-5 ), and three methyl protons at d 3.81 (s, H-10 ) suggested a derived moiety in compound **1**. This spectrum also gave signals for one oxymethine hydrogen at d 4.99 (brs, H-3), three methyl protons at d 1.19 (m, H-7), and two methines at d 3.14 (m, H-2) and 2.80 (m, H-6). The two multiplets at d 1.62 and 1.48, integrated for four protons, were assigned to H-46/H-54\\({}_{\\text{eq}}\\) and H-46/H-54\\({}_{\\text{av}}\\), respectively, on the basis of correlations observed in the 'H-1H COSY spectrum. Signals for methylene protons at d 1.48 (m, H-1 ), 1.16-1.21 (m, H-2 -H-9 ), and 2.34 (t, 7.5 Hz, H-10 ) and methyl protons at d 2.06 (s, H-12 ) clearly indicated a long saturated side chain as previously observed in compounds **2** and **3**.16 The \\({}^{1}\\)C NMR and DEPT-1357 spectra showed signals for three methines carbons at d 69.0, 56.9, and 54.4,\n\n## Page 2\n\nmethylene carbons at d 29.1-29.7, and one methyl carbon at d 16.9, which strongly supported the 2,6-disubstituted-piperidin-3-ol ring similar to those reported for (-)-spectaline (**2**) and (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (**3**)16 (Figure 1).\n\nThe joint analysis of the 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and HMBC spectra evidenced signals for a carbonyl carbon at d 209.6, correlating to methylene protons at d 2.34 and to methyl protons at d 2.06, which were assigned to a terminal methyl ketone subunit on the side chain at C-6. The carboxyl signal at d 166.7 correlated to the olefinic methine at d 7.68 in the HMBC spectrum and suggested an a,d-unsaturated conjugation between the piperidine unit and the 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring. The downfield value of the methine carbon at d 69.0, when compared to that in (-)-spectaline (d 67.9), and its correlation with the H-7 methyl protons led us to propose a conjugated ester at C-3 on the piperidine ring. The HMBC correlations observed for the methoxy protons at d 3.81 to the quaternary carbon at d 147.0 and for the aromatic methines H-2 (d 7.06), H-5 (d 6.82) to the carbon at d 148.3 evidenced the presence of aromatic methoxy and hydroxy substituents at C-3 and C-4 (Figure 1). The NOESY 1D experiment indicated the position of methoxy at C-3 and hydroxy at C-4 on the basis of the sole spatial correlation of the methoxy protons and H-2. All of these assignments were confirmed by additional HMBC correlations and led us to propose the structure of 2-methyl-3-feruloyl-6-(dodecyl-11 -one)piperidine for compound **1**, which was confirmed by the molecular ion peak at _m/z_ 474.3198 in its HRESIMS. The relative configurations at C-2, C-3, and C-6 were established by comparison of the coupling constants observed for **1** with those published for **2** and **3**16,19 and NOESY 1D experiments. The irradiation of the H-2 signal confirmed its relative spatial correlations to H-3, H-4a, H-6, and H-7 protons as _cis_. Therefore, the structure of **1** was assigned as (+)-2-methyl-3-feruloyl-6-(dodecyl-11 -one)piperidine.\n\nThe free radical scavenging activity of compounds **1-3** was evaluated spectrophotometrically by using the stable free radical DPPH and measuring the decrease in absorption at 517 nm. Compounds **2** and **3** were weakly active in this assay and exhibited absorbance variation lower than 10% at 60 ppm. However, compound **1** showed moderate activity (%\\(\\Delta\\)A = 40% at 60 ppm) when compared to the standard truth (%\\(\\Delta\\)A = 92% at 60 ppm), which may be associated with the presence of a feruloyl moiety in the structure of **1**.\n\nThe lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity of the isolates was evaluated by measurement of the fluorescence decay after adding Fe\\({}^{2+}\\) to initiate the oxidation of large unilamellar vesicles. The alkaloids were tested at 100 ppm, the extract was tested at 250 ppm, and commercial antioxidants BHT, BHA, and vitamin E were used as standard reference compounds at 1.9, 2.2, and 4.3 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids **2** and **3** exhibited moderate inhibition (ca. 75% after 21 min, Figure 2) of the liposome peroxidation. Alkaloid **1** showed only 50% inhibition of the LPO, despite the presence of a feruloyl moiety in its structure, which is normally associated with an increase in antioxidant activity. This behavior might be at least partly explained by the possible chelation of Fe\\({}^{2+}\\) ions by compounds **2** and **3**, in contrast to the poor ability for Fe\\({}^{2+}\\) chelation of compound **1**. The use of AAPH as the free radical initiator, instead of Fe\\({}^{2+}\\), confirmed this observation by showing a similar trend in lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (ca. 50%) by compounds **1-3**.\n\nInhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzyme activity of compounds **1-3** was evaluated by polarographic measurement of the oxygen uptake during the COX-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Each alkaloid was tested at 100 ppm and compared to standard reference compounds refecoxib, celecoxib, and aspirin, which were tested at 1.7, 1.7, and 108 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids **1-3** inhibited COX-1 enzyme by 33, 40, and 58%, respectively. However, the inhibitory activities of COX-2 enzyme by these compounds were marginal (Figure 3).\n\nIn summary, we have isolated three alkaloids (**1-3**) from the green fruits of _S. spectabilis_, which showed weak to moderate free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH and moderate lipoperoxidation inhibitory properties. In addition, these compounds displayed moderate anti-inflammatory activities, especially toward COX-1. Additional research is needed to further explain the anecdotal medicinal claims of this fruit and its potential to be considered as a medicinal or dietary supplement.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**Plant Material.** Plant material was collected in February 2004 from a specimen of _Sema specethilis_ cultivated in the Chemistry Institute at Sao Paulo State University (Aararaquara-SP). A voucher (SP 370917) was deposited at the herbarium of Sao Paulo Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** Green fruits of _S. specethilis_ (8 kg) were ground and extracted with EtOH (5 x 5 L). Evaporation of solvent yielded 676 g of a crude extract (8.5%). The extract was analyzed by TLC (silica gel, CHCl\\({}_{3}\\)-MeOH\\(-\\)NH\\({}_{4}\\)OH, 36:3:1) to confirm the presence of alkaloids by spraying with Dragonoff and iodochloro-platinate reactions. This extract (9 g) was then suspended in MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O, 4:1, the insoluble residue was removed by filtration, and the remaining solution was partitioned successively with hexanes, CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{3}\\), EtOHac, and \\(n\\)-BuOH. Analysis of the organic fractions by TLC revealed that most of the alkaloid constituents were concentrated in the CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) fraction (5.7 g). An aliquot of the CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) fraction (1 g) was then fractionated by neutral alumina column chromatography (hexanes/Et\\({}_{2}\\)O and Et\\({}_{3}\\)O/MeOH gradients) to give 30 fractions. Fractions 1-3 (30.4 mg) were further purified by neutral alumina column chromatography (CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)-MeOH, 99:1) and gave compounds 2 (3.4 mg) and 3 (9 mg). Fractions 28-30 (402.6 mg) showed strong UV absorption at 254 nm. An aliquot (200 mg) of this mixture was purified by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc\\(-\\)MeOH\\(-\\)TEA, 90:9:9: 0.1) to give alkaloid 1 (20.2 mg).\n\n**(+)-2-Methyl-3-2-(trimethyl-6-dodecyl-11-one)piperidine(1):** pale yellow oil; [a]\\({}^{20}\\)\\(+\\)2-9 (1.00, CHCl\\({}_{3}\\)); UV (MeOH) \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\) (log \\(\\varepsilon\\)) 326 (4.25), 236 (4.03) mm; IR (KBr) \\(\\nu_{\\text{max}}\\) 3413, 3050, 2927, 2854, 1710, 1629, 1596, 1515, 1452, 1373 cm\\({}^{-1}\\); \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR (CDCl\\({}_{3}\\), 500 MHz) \\(\\delta\\) 7.68 (1H, d = 15.5 Hz, H-8 ), 7.06 (1H, br, s-H-2 ), 7.00 (1H, br, d = 8.5 Hz, H-8 ), 8.5 Hz, H-8 ), 6.36 (1H, d = 15.5 Hz, H-7 ), 4.99 (1H, br, s-H-3 ), 331 (3H, s, OCH\\({}_{3}\\), 3.4 (1H, H, H-2), 2.80 (1H, m, H-6), 2.34 (2H, t = 7.5 Hz, H-10 ), 2.06 (3H, s, H-12 ), 1.62 (2H, m, H-4o/H-5o), 1.48 (6H, m, H-4o/H-5o), 1.48 (6H, m, H-5o/H-H-1 /H-9 ), 1.21-1.16 (1H, hrs, H-2 H-8 ), 1.19 (3H, m, H-7); \\({}^{15}\\) NMR (CDCl\\({}_{3}\\), 12% MHz) 209 (6C, C-1 ), 1.667 (C, CO feuyl moiety), 148.3 (C, C-4 ), 147 (C, C-3 ), 145 (7H, C-8 ), 126.8 (C, C-1 ), 123.3 (CH, C-6 ), 114.9 (CH, C-7  and C-5 ), 109.6 (CH, C-2 ), 69.0 (CH, C-3), 56.9 (CH, C-6), 55.9 (CH, OCH\\({}_{3}\\), 54.4 (CH, C-2), 43.8 (CH, C-10 ), 34.9 (CH\\({}_{2}\\)C,-1 ), 29.1-29.7 (CH, C-4, C-2 \\(-\\)C-8 ), 25.6 (CH2, C-5), 23.8 (CH2, C-9), 16.9 (CH, C-7); HRESIMs \\(m/z\\) [M + H]\\({}^{4}\\) 47.3198 (caled for C2sLaNos 474.3219).\n\n**Determination of Radical-Scavenging Activity.** 2,2-Diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a stable radical in methanol as per the published procedure.\\({}^{20}\\) Rutin was used as a reference compound.\n\n**Lipid Peroxidation Assay.** This antioxidant bioassay was conducted, as per the published procedure from our laboratory, by analysis of a model liposome oxidation using fluorescence spectroscopy.\\({}^{2f}\\)\n\n**Cyclooxygenase Enzymes (COX-1 and -2) Inhibitory Assay.** The COX-1 enzyme inhibitory assay was conducted with an enzyme preparation from ram seminal vesicles, and inhibition of COX-2 was performed by using a preparation from insect cell lysate cloned with human PGBIS-2 enzyme as per the published procedure from our laboratory.\\({}^{22,23}\\)\n\n**Acknowledgment.** This project was partially funded by the Michigan State University Center for Plant Products and Technologies.

Le Roch, Mario A. Izidoro, Paulo C. Vieira\n\n# Abstract\n\n_Metrodorea stipularis_ stem extracts were studied in the search for possible antichagastic, antimalarial, and antitumoral compounds using cruzain from _Tympanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium falciparum_, and cathepsin B and L, as molecular targets, respectively. Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed significant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Compounds 1-4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 \\(\\mu\\)M against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three different strains of _P. falciparum_ in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsin B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 \\(\\mu\\)M. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe study of the role of the various species of dihydrochalcones is a key step in the development of the biological process of cancer.

Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6-trihydroyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2,en-1-yl)phenyl)propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2\n\nCompounds **2** and **3** were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESTTOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for **2** and **3**, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C23H30O3 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for **2** and **3** showed one singlet at \\(d\\) 5.92 attributed to H-8', the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both **2** and **3** the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.76 (H-3') and 2.53 (H-4') and the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.33 (H-9' and H-10'). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at \\(d\\) 6.91 (H-5' and H-7') and 6.56 (H-8') for **2** and signals at \\(d\\) 6.87 (H-2'), 6.83 (H-6'), and 6.64 (H-5') for **3** assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound **2** showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.73 (H-3') and 2.69 (H-4') and the signals of the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.22 (H-8' and H-9'). Compound **3** displayed one premyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4'' and H-5''), one olefinic hydrogen at \\(d\\) 5.28 (H-2''), and the methylene signal at \\(d\\) 3.25 (H-1''). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in **1** and confirmed the structures of **2** and **3**.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESTTOFMS data showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (calculated _m_/_z_ 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O3. As mentioned for compounds **2** and **3**, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the characteristic signals of the three methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at \\(d\\) 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and confirmed the structure of **4**.\n\nThe dihydrochalcones **1**-**4** showed inhibition activities against crazin, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 _m_M (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the first report of crazin inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies.\n\nDihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 _m_M (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochalcones **1** and **3** showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these compounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more effective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydrochalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsin s such as cathepsin K.12\n\nThe dihydrochalcones were also tested against _Plasmodium falciparum_ growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against _P. falciparum_ the dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** showed significant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 _m_M for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against _P. falciparum_ growth for this class of compounds.\n\nFour compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases crazin and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of _Plasmodium falciparum_. The results described in this paper are significant, since this is the first report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against crazin, and it is interesting that compounds **2** and **4** are active against cathepsin B, while compounds **1** and **3** are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of finding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nAll commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co, and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-_4\\(6\\) and methanol-_4\\(p\\) using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe AITA). MS data were collected on a Bruker Dalonics micrOTOF-Q. II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H5SO/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230-700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna).\n\n### Plant Materials.\n\nThe stems of _Metrodarea stipularis_ were collected in July 2010 at the Agornomic Institute in Campinas, SP1; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 degC, affording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against crucain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed significant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 5.0 cm x h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10.0, 15.5, 5.5, 0.10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1-MSD24).\n\nFraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15.1-MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg).\n\nFraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 3.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD211_1-MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD211_8-MSD21\\(8\\)20). Subfraction MSD21_8 12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21\\(8\\)19 (9 mg) was purified by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, _ph_ = 1.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/cAMP/H2O (4:15) as mobile phase and a flow of 3.5 mL/min to afford 4 (2.5 mg).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)/propan-1-one (2):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2066 (caled for C3H2H2O3 _m_/_z_ 410.2094).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(14-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4-trimethyl-2,3,44,96-hydroxy-10-Mantham-7-ylpropan-1-one (4):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 2; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (caled for C9H2O3 _m_/_z_ 478.2720).\n\n**Enzyme Inhibition Assays.**_Gruzin._ All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectrofluorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured by hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonylphenylanalytarginine-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide). The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) with 5 mL of DTT at 37 degC after addition of 2 mL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with five inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the program GraFit S.\n\n_Cothepins._ All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Molecular Devices Spectra\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & compound 2 & compound 3 & \\\\ position & _δ_0°_a_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ \\\\\n1 & 204.7, qC & & 204.0, qC & & \\\\\n2 & 45.5, CH2 & 3.30, t (7.2) & 6°, 1, 3 & 45.5, CH2 & 3.25, t & 1, 2° \\\\\n3′ & 29.7, CH2 & 2.83 & 5′, 7′, 1, 2 & 30.2, CH2 & 2.82, t (8.4) & 1′\n\n## Page 4\n\nMAX M3 fluorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic fluorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and a concentration of 185 _m_M for catB and 10 _m_M for catL. The enzyme was activated for 5 min with DTT and acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 degC, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 200 _m_L, kept under stirring (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptides, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with at least seven inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot 12.0.\n\n_Bioasory of Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth._ The strains 3D7, W2, and Dd2 of _P. falciparum_ malaria parasites (BEI Resources, MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in human type O+ erythrocytes in complete medium (RPMI 1640 (Celgrg), 0.043 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 0.014 mg/mL hypoxanthine (Acros), 38.5 mm HEPES (Sigma), 0.18% NaHCO3 (Celgrg), 0.20% Glucose (MP Biomedical), 0.003 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.2% Albumax (Gibco), 5% human serum) as previously described.1 Briefly, cultures were maintained in 25 cm2 flasks (Corning) at a volume of 10 mL and were glassed for 30 s with an environment of 3% CO2, 1% O2, and 96% N2, then incubated at 37 degC.\n\nThe antimalarial activity was determined with a SYBR Green based parasite proliferation assay, adapted from Smilkstein15 and Bennett.16 Using this technique, the increase of parasite DNA contained in human red blood cells was measured after 72 h of incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds.17 Relative fluorescence values were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM fluorimeter (excitation 495 nm and emission 525 nm). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and plotted with SigmaPlot 10 (Systat).\n\n\\({}^{a13}\\)C NMR values obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data (100 MHz, methanol-\n\n## Page 5\n\n* (11) Vasiljeva, T.; Reinheckel, C.; Peters, D.; Turk, V.; Turk, B. _Curr.

Therefore, the structure **1** was proposed for cuspanine.\n\nCusculine [**2**] is very closely related to cuspanine [**1**]. The only difference observed in the \\({}^{1}\\)H-nmr spectrum was an additional peak for an MeO group, suggesting the presence of five MeO groups in the molecule. In addition to this observation, the bathochromic shift observed in the uv spectrum of **1** was not detected with **2**, indicating that an MeO group was substituted for the phenolic group of **1**. This was further supported by the \\({}^{13}\\)C-nmr spectrum which showed three signals in lower field at 8 61.89, 61.53, and 60.94, indicating the presence of three hindered MeO groups (4) and leading to structure **2** for cusculine.\n\nCuspanine [**2**], 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone, was synthesized from 2-bromo-3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid [**6**]. The first method that was tried for the preparation of **6** was the bromination of isovanillin in refluxing CHCl3, followed by methylation (Me2SO4) and oxidation (Jones' reagent). However, the bromination gave a poor yield (18%), so the following alternate approach, using a directed metallation method, was adopted.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe methoxymethyl ether (MOM ether) [4], prepared from 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol [3] and methoxymethyl chloride, was lithiated in Et2O with _n_-butyllithium at 0deg. The resulting yellow precipitates were treated with \\(1,1,2,2,\\)-tetrabromoethane (5) at \\(-78^{\\circ}\\), and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature to give a bromide **5** with a 66% yield. Hydrolysis of the MOM ether of **5** with HBr in warm EtOH, followed by oxidation with Jones' reagent, gave **6** in a 69% yield. Ullmann condensation (6) of **6** and \\(3,4,5\\)-trimethoxysaniline [7] in the presence of freshly prepared copper powder and K2CO3 in DMF gave **8** with a 56% yield appearing as orange plates. Treatment of **8** with polyphosphoric acid and xylene (7) at \\(150^{\\circ}\\) gave **2** in the form of yellow prisms with a yield of 55%. Selective hydrolysis of the 1-MeO group of **2** was achieved by refluxing in MeOH with concentrated HCl and 70% HClO4 to afford **1** (Scheme 1). The physical data for both **1** and **2** were identical with those of the natural products. The structure of **1** was unambiguously determined by a single crystal **X**-ray analysis (Figure 1).\n\nBoth alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail _Biomphalaria glabrata_. The LC50 of cuspanine [1] was 5 ppm and that of cuscline [2] was 20 ppm. There are only a few examples in the literature (8,9) where alkaloids exhibiting high toxicity to snails are observed. These two alkaloids also showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several carcinoma cell lines. The IC50's of **1** and **2** against HeLa epithelioid carcinoma cells were 2.5 and 8.5 mg/ml, respectively. In addition, they also inhibited the growth of BT-20 human breast carcinoma cells.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nAll the procedures were the same as previously described (2).\n\nIsolation of constituents.--The leaves of _A. paniculata_ were collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in February 1988, and identified by Dr. Jose R. Pirani, Instituto de Biociencias, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of this institute. The dried pulverized leaves were first extracted with CH2Cl2 followed by MeOH at ambient temperature. A subsequent molluscicidal bioassay using _B. glabrata_ indicated the CH2Cl2 extract to be active. The CH2Cl2 extract (2.983 g) was chromatographed over Si gel, using CH2Cl2, ErOAc, and MeOH. This process yielded 11 fractions. The bioactive fraction, eluted with EtOAc, was rechromatographed over Si gel (Lichroprep), affording cuspanine [1] (60 mg). The fractions eluted with MeOH after the same procedure gave cuscline [2] (200 mg).\n\nFigure 1: Molecular structure of 1,2,3,5,6-pentametrhodory-9-acridone [2] from **X**-ray crystallography.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n_Cupanine, 1-hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethyloxy-9-uridine_[1].--Yellow crystals: mp 164-166deg (from MeOH); uv l max (MeOH) nm (log e) 212 (3.84), 256 (4.83), 324 (3.78), 384 (3.60); ir l max (MeOH + AlCl3) nm 220, 250, 272, 340, 420; ir \\(v\\) max (KBr) cm-1 1635, 1620, 1570, 1520, 1290, 1210, 1030; 1H nmr (CDCl3, 500 MHz) d ppm 8.44 (1H, br s, NH), 8.06 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-8), 6.92 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-7), 6.23 (1H, s, H-4), 4.02, 4.00, 3.95, 3.90 (each 3H, s, OMe); 13C nmr (CDCl3, 125 MHz D ppm 181.14 (s, C-5), 159.41 (s, C-3), 155.53 (s, C-1), 154.52 (s, C-6), 138.06 (s, C-11), 135.02 (s, C-5), 133.72 (s, C-5), 130.27 (s, C-\n\n## Page 5\n\nwere acidified with dilute HCl, extracted with CHCl3, dried, and evaporated.

They are HeLa ATCC CCL 219, epithelioid cervix carcinoma from human, and BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma from human. Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air at 37deg. These human monolayer cultures were subcultured with a 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nThe cytotoxicity assays were performed by a microulture tetrazolium (MYT) (Sigma) method (12). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtitre plates at 4000-6000 cells/well, with various concentrations of the samples. After incubation, 50 ml MTT (3 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye was solubilized by adding 100 ml DMSO to each well, followed by gentle shaking. The extinction coefficient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photometer Labsystems, at a wavelength of 620 nm.\n\n## 2 Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dr. Jose R.

However, the occurrence of the new guanidine-type alkaloid **1** can be explained by taking into account the imine tautomerism (Figure 1).\n\nNitensidine E (**2**) was isolated as a colorless oil. The molecular formula was determined to be C1H1H3N by HRESIMS (_m/z_ 194.2900 [M + H]+, calcd for C1H20N3, 194.2888), suggesting four degrees of unsaturation, with one additional unsaturation when compared with nitensidine D. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound **2** (Table 1) indicated structural characteristics somewhat different from those of **1** and the other guanidines isolated previously from _P. nitens_.4 Considering that **2** possesses four unsaturations and showed positive Dragonoff's and Sakaguchi's tests, an alkaloid structure was deduced for this compound. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited the presence of a set of typical resonances at \\(d\\) 5.52 (d, \\(J\\) = 15.0 Hz), 5.81 (d, \\(J\\) = 10.5 Hz), and 6.20 (dd, \\(J\\) = 15.0, 10.5 Hz), characteristic of a sp2-conjugated system, which could be attributed to an _E_-diene unit based on the coupling constants shown for these hydrogens. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) showed resonances for three methine sp2 carbons at \\(d\\) 135.4, 125.2, and 123.9 and for one quaternary sp2 carbon at \\(d\\) 135.0. Additionally, both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed the presence of two vinyl methyl groups (_b_ 1.69 (18.0), 1.73 (25.5)] and a tertiary methyl group at \\(d\\) 1.26 (27.6). These data revealed the presence of a C10 alkyl chain, which could be attributed to a monoterpene-type unit. The structural evidence from the spectroscopic data obtained allowed us to elucidate compound **2** with a guanidine alkaloid structure. Additionally, the mutually coupled methylenes [_d_ 1.61 (1H, m), 1.79 (1H, ddd, \\(J\\) = 13.5, 4.0, 3.5 Hz), and 2.92 (1H, ddd, \\(J\\) = 12.0, 14.0, 4 Hz), and \\(d\\) 3.15 (1H, ddd, \\(J\\) = 12.0, 4.0, 3.5 Hz)] would be compatible with a cyclic guanidine structure for **2**. Indeed, this proposal was confirmed from the gHMBC spectrum. The location of the methyl group C-10 was assigned at C-3 due to the observed gHMBC correlations between the methyl protons at H-10 and C-2, C-3, and C-4. Further, gHMBC cross-peaks between H-4 and C-2, C-10, C-6; H-1 and C-2, C-3; H-2 and C-10, C-4; and H-6 and C-8, C-9 completed the assignment of a cyclic guanidine-type alkaloid and its substituents. Also, a C10 alkyl chain composed of an _E_-diene unit was confirmed through NOESY correlations observed for H-4 and H-6. The conformation adopted by this molecule was evaluated in a preliminary manner employing semiempirical calculations (Hamiltonian as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G**), and a plausible conformation obtained for compound **2** with the methyl group at C-3 in the _b_-position is shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information. In Figure S2 (Supporting Information) we show a biogenetic proposal for the formation of the new guanidine derivatives **1** and **2**.\n\nIn addition to **1** and **2**, three known compounds were isolated and identified as pterogyrine10 (**3**), pterogyridine4 (**4**), and gaseleine11 (**5**). Compound **5** was first isolated from _Verbesina enclooides_ (Asteraceae) and later identified as a toxic and antidiabetic component from _Galega officials_ (Goat's Rue).12 Galegine was a template for the design of metformin and other biquanide-type hypoglycemic drugs.13 The identification of compounds **3-5** was based on 1H and 13C NMR and MS data analysis and by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory.4,10,11\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of biological activities has been described for guanidine alkaloids belonging to marine sources, few studies were reported from higher plants and of the potential anticancer activity of this class of natural products.14-16 All isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity, using a MTT assay, evidencing a key role of the prenyi substitution pattern in the level of activity. The cytotoxic activity of compounds **1-5** was evaluated _in vitro_ against HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma). Mean concentration inhibitory (IC50) values were determined using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol, with slight modifications, and the results are shown in Table 2. In human cells, nitensidine E (**2**) was the most active compound, showing activity for the different cell lines (Table 2). Therefore, guanidine alkaloids **2** may be useful as a prototype compound for the development of new antineoplastic drugs. Further work to evaluate the mechanism of action of the guanidine alkaloids characterized in this study is currently in progress.\n\nThe structural features of nitensidines D (**1**) and E (**2**) appear less common than the guanidine alkaloids already reported from other higher plants. It is noteworthy that the majority of these alkaloids contain isoperly groups. Only one alkaloid having a similar geranyl side chain has been previously isolated from _Fontainea pancheri_ (Euphorbiaceae).17 In some cases, the isopentenyl groups have undergone cyclization to produce hexahydroimidazolo-pyrimidines, typical of _Alchomea_ species (Euphorbiaceae).18,19 The structure of nitensidine E (**2**) constitutes the first report of the\n\nFigure 1: Ininic tautomeric forms of guanidine-type alkaloids **1** and **1a**.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nnatural occurrence of a cyclic monoterpene derivative on a guanidine moiety.\n\nTo date, the isolation and characterization of preynlated guanidine alkaloids has been reported only within a limited number of plant genera.[20, 21, 22] Furthermore, terpenoid-like alkaloids may have some taxonomic significance for Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae, since their occurrence is most common among these taxa.\n\n### Experimental Section\n\n**General Experimental Procedures.** 1D (\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)H, \\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)C, DEPT 90\\(\\times\\) and DEPT 135\\(\\times\\)) and 2D (\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)H\\(-\\)H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (H) and 125 MHz (\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)C), using DMSO-\\(d_{\\theta}\\) as an internal standard. Positive-ion high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an HRMS ultroTOTO-gSL-TCOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics). IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr disks. Optical rotations were measured on a Polarant A Carl Zeiss jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (\\(>\\) 230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 Tc, as well as by using Dragendorff's and Sakaguchi's reagents. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden.\n\n**Plant Material.**_Prerogen nitenes_ leaves were collected at the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sko Paulo State, Brazil).\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The shade-dried leaves (2.8 kg) of _P. nitenes_ were ground and defatted with hexane (2.0 L x 5, at room temperature, for five weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macroactin with ethanol (4.0 L x 5) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (\\(<\\)40 IC) to yield 12.7 g of a syrup. The concentrate was then diluted with CHOH-H2O (4.1) (3.5 L) and partitioned successively with EOAc (5.0 L x 3) and _n_-butanol (5.0 L x 3). After removal of the solvent 3.7 and 5.9 g of extract were afforded, respectively. The _n_-butanol residue was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sephadex LH-20 (2.5 g) in methanol to afford nine fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC visualized with Sakaguchi's[24] and Dragendorff's reagents, to yield an alkaloidal fraction (587 mg). Separation of this fraction on reversed-phase silica gel column chromatography (RP-18) by elution with increasing amounts of McN in H2O afforded eight fractions (ALK-1\\(-\\)ALK-8) and guanidine **5** (18 mg). Fraction ALK-3 (121 mg) was subjected to repeated column chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluted with CHCl3-MeOH mixtures (ranging from 0 to 35% MeOH), to furnish the isoperylated alkaloids **3** (27 mg) and **4** (12 mg). Fraction ALK-7 (62 mg) was further purified by RP-HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (16:84:0.01), UV detection at 235 nm; flow rate 13 mL/min], affording the new separated alkaloids **1** (22 mg) and **2** (11 mg).\n\n**Nitensidine **D (1)**: colorless oil; IR (KBr) _r_max 1652, 1618, 1012, 845 cm-1; H and 3C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMs _m/z_ 196.3052 [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) (caled for C1H2N19, 196.3063).\n\n**Nitensidine E (2)**: colorless oil; [a]\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)25\\({}_{\\rm{i}}\\) +140.0 (_c_ 0.01, MeOH); IR (KBr) _r_max 1649, 1618, 1093, 839 cm-1; 1H and 1C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMs _m/z_ 194.2900 [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) (caled for C1H2N19, 194.2888).\n\n**Cytotoxicity Assay.** The cytotoxicity of the guanidine alkaloids **1\\(-\\)5** was tested against four tumor cell lines: HL-60 (human leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 IC with 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (10\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\) cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 x 10\\({}^{\\rm{6}}\\) cells/well for suspended cells in 100 _m_L of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39\\(-\\)25 mg/mL) dissolved in DMSO (5%) were added to each well and incubated for three days. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Doxorubicin (0.01\\(-\\)0.58 _m_g/mL) was used as positive control. Growth of tumor cells was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2,4-diazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan product. At the end of 72 h incubation, the medium in each well was replaced by fresh medium (200 _m_L) containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product of MTT reduction was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (Spectra Count, Packard, Ontario, Canada). Drug effect was quantified as the percentage of control absorbance of reduced dye at 590 nm. The IC\\({}_{\\rm{i}}\\)0 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHAPD program (Institutive Software for Science, San Diego).[25]\n\n**Acknowledgment.** This work was funded by grants of the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) as part of Biota-FAPESP, The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biotasp.org.br), grant no. 03/02176-7, awarded to V.S.B.

HO-MODE experiments were carried out decoupling H-2' (\\(\\delta\\) 1.64), which enabled the loss of multiplicity from the neighboring H-1' and H-3' (overlapped with H-4'). When H-5' was decoupled, loss of multiplicity was observed for H-6' and H-4' (overlapped with H-3'), supporting the same chemical shift for H-3' and H-4'. The same pattern was observed with H-10' and H-11' when H-9' and H-12' were decoupled. The interpretation of these gHMRC sequence cross-peaks led to the establishment of the oxo function at the C-7' position in the side chain. Furthermore, the gHMRC correlations of H-5 with C-3 (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_) and C-1' (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_), together with that from H-7 to C-2 (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_) and C-3 (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_), allowed the hydroxy group to be located at C-3, which was consistent with a previous study on bioactive piperidine alkaloids from _Senna_ (_Cassia_) species, with features similar to **1.3** Additionally, the gHMRC (\\({}^{1}\\)H\\({}^{-15}\\)N) spectrum showed a correlation between the nitrogen signal at \\(\\delta\\) 308.8 and signals at \\(\\delta\\) 2.67 (H-1'), 6.84 (H-5), and 2.47 (H-7). All this evidence agreed with the hydroxy group being located at C-3 and confirmed the assumption made on the substitution pattern in pyridine alkaloid **1**, which must be 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-_n_-(7'-oxodocyl) pyridine, similar to those found for piperidine alkaloids from other _Senna_ (_Cassia_) species, except for the ketone group position in the side chain. These results suggested that the hydroxy group of this pyridine alkaloid is at C-3, which is not in agreement with those previously reported for a similar pyridine alkaloid from this species, with no hydroxy group being located at C-5.5\n\nCompound **2** was obtained as a white solid, mp 71\\(-\\)73 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, and gave a positive test with Dragonoff reagent. This compound showed spectroscopic features very similar to those of **1**. The HRESITOFMS for **2** exhibited a pseudomolecular ion peak at _m/z_ 308.2226 [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) (called for C18H30NO3, 308.2220), appropriate for the molecular formula C18H29NO3, with a hydrogen deficiency index of 5 and being 16 mass units more than that of 1. The IR spectrum revealed the carbonyl absorption band at 1703 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), a pyridine ring at 1584, 1489, and 1464 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and a hydroxy group band at 3392 cm\\({}^{-1}\\). The \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of compound **2** showed signals very close to those of **1** (Table 1), as in the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR system, which demonstrates the presence of a substituted pyridine ring system at \\(\\delta\\) 7.02 (1H, \\(d\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-4) and 6.85 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-5). Additionally, the methyl hydrogens of CH3-7 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.48, analyzed together with \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data, confirmed that the pyridine moiety is similar to that of **1**. However, differences were evident between these compounds since the methyl group (CH3-12') located in the side chain of **1** was replaced with a hydroxy methylene group in **2** at \\(\\delta\\) 3.67 (2H, t, \\(J\\) = 6.5, H-12', \\(\\delta\\)\\({}_{C}\\) 62.5). These data, supported by the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR, DEPT, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY, and HOMODEC spectra, were in agreement with a pyridine system bearing one hydroxy group, one methyl, and one long-chain substituent. According to these data, the structure of **2** was determined as 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-_n_-(7'-oxo-12'-hydroxy-dodecyl)pyridine. All compounds isolated were screened for their AChE inhibitory activity, using bioautography and microplate tests, and the results are shown in Table 2. The preliminary TLC assay suggested moderate activity for compounds **1** and **2**, which showed the minimum amounts of these alkaloids required for AChE inhibition of 0.75 and 0.18 \\(\\mu\\)g, respectively, when compared with physostigmine (positive control, 0.05 \\(\\mu\\)g). Rutin proved to be inactive, since the minimum amount required to show activity was over 100 \\(\\mu\\)g. In addition, the microplate test confirmed activity of the compounds **1** and **2**, which exhibited weak AChE inhibition of 13% and 30% at 350 mM.\n\n### Experimental Section\n\n**General Experimental Procedures.** Melting points were recorded on a digital Microquimica MQAPF-302 apparatus and are uncorrected. UV data were acquired using an Amersham Ultrospec 2100 pro UV/viv spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet SiO10 FT-IR spectrometer coupled with an ATR accessory (the samples were pressed against a crystal of Ge). The 1D ('H, \\({}^{13}\\)C, DEPT, NOESY, TOSSY, and fMMODEC) and 2D ('H\\({}^{-14}\\) gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and H\\({}^{-15}\\)N gHMRC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7) at 500 MHz ('H) and 125 MHz ('IC) at 30 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C and referenced using TMS (\\(\\Omega_{\\rm{TBS}}\\) = 0.00) as internal standard or residual solvent resonances of CDCl3 at 7.26 and 77.0 ppm, respectively, for 'H and 'C. High-resolution mass spectra with electrospray ionization were measured on an altrOTOFO (Bruker Daltonics) operating in positive mode. MeOH\\(-\\)H2O (4:1) was used as solvent system.\n\nTLC was performed on silica gel F5x4 plates (0.20 mm, Fluka), and spots were visualized under UV light (254 and 366 nm) and spraying with Dragonoff's reagent or anisiodded\\(-\\)H2SO4. followed by charring for 5 min. Preparative TLC was carried out with Anatech 500 \\(\\mu\\)m thick silica gel GF plates (20 x 20 cm, Uniplate) and visualized under UV light at 366 nm. Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) ProStar system equipped with a ternary pump model 340, a photodiode array detector model 330, and an autosampler model 410, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.52 software. Preparative HPLC separation was performed on a Varian PrepStar system equipped with a UV\\(-\\)vis detector model 320 and a binary pump model SD-1 manual injector, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.51 software. The columns used were a Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 x 4.60 mm, 5 mm) and a preparative Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 x 21.20 mm, 10 \\(\\mu\\)m) protected by corresponding guard columns. All solvents used in the experimental procedures were distilled previously. For chromatographic analysis, HPLC-grade solvents (J. T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico) were employed. Water was purified immediately prior to use with a Milli Q plus system (Millipore, Milford, MA).\n\n**Plant Material.** Leaves of _S. multigas_ were collected in Araraquara (Sao Paulo, Brazil) in July 2008 by one of the authors (M.P.). The plant was identified by Jnss Cordeiro from the Institute of Botany in Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil. A voucher specimen (SP 384103) has been deposited in the herbarium of this institute.\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The dried and powdered leaves (2.7 kg) were extracted with ethanol (8 L x 4) for five days at room temperature.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & AChE inhibitory activity \\\\ compound & bioautography\\({}^{a}\\) & microplate\\({}^{b}\\) \\\\\n**1** & 0.75 & 13 ± 2.0 \\\\\n**2** & 0.18 & 30 ± 1.3 \\\\ rutin & \\textgreater{}100 & not tested \\\\ physostigmine\\({}^{c}\\) & 0.05 & 87 ± 0.1 \\\\ \\hline \\({}^{a}\\) Minimum amount required for inhibition of AChE on TLC plates (in \\(\\mu\\)g). \\({}^{b}\\) Percentage of AChE inhibition at 350 mM. \\({}^{c}\\) Positive control. \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: AChE Inhibitory Activity of Compounds **1** and **2** and **Rutin**\n\nFigure 1: Key gHMRC correlations for **1** and **2**.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation, yielding a thick syrup (210 g). The crude ethanol extract (100 g) was further reconstituted in MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O (4:1), filtered, and then partitioned with _n_-hexane (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 5), CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 4), EtOAc (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 4), and _n_-BuOH (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 2), successively. All phases were concentrated under reduced pressure. The CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) fraction (15.9 g) was dissolved in 500 mL of 5% HCl aqueous solution (ca. pH 2), filtered, and partitioned with EtOAc (50 mL \\(\\times\\) 3) to remove nonbasic components. Then, NH\\({}_{4}\\)OH (30%) was added to the aqueous phase until ca. pH 8.5 and partitioned with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) (50 mL \\(\\times\\) 5). The latter organic layer was washed with H\\({}_{2}\\)O (100 mL \\(\\times\\) 3) and concentrated in order to give a neutral alkaloid fraction (457 mg), which was purified by using preparative TLC with _n_-hexane\\(-\\)CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)\\(-\\)EtOAc (1.5: 2.0:6.5) as developing solvent (\\(\\times\\)2). The bands with _Rf_ values of 0.50 and 0.18 were scraped and eluted with MeOH, affording pure compounds **1** (49.1 mg) and **2** (60.5 mg). Fraction EtOAc (2.20 g) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-Cl\\({}_{8}\\) and eluted with MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O (5:95 to 100:0) to yield six fractions (EtOAc-F1 to EtOAc-F6). Fractions EtOAc-F2 and EtOAc-F3 (527 mg) were further purified by preparative HPLC on RP-Cl\\({}_{8}\\) and eluted with MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O (40:60, flow rate 19 mL/min, UV 254 nm), affording compound **3** (\\(\\mathrm{{}_{R}}\\) 17.4 min, 42.0 mg).\n\n**Bioautographic Assay.** The AChE inhibitory activity of pure compounds was determined using a TLC bioautographic assay as previously described.12 The TLC layers were spotted with **1** and **2** in a range from 0.09 to 6.00 _mg_ developed with _n_-hexane\\(-\\)EtOAc (1:4, v/v) and subsequently dried. The plates were then sprayed with the enzyme solution (6.66 U/mL), thoroughly dried, and incubated at 37 degC for 20 min (moist atmosphere). Enzyme activity was detected by spraying with a solution consisting of 0.25% of 1-naphthyl acetate in EtOH plus 0.25% aqueous solution of Fast Blue B salt. Potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appeared as clear zones on a purple-colored background. Electric eel AChE type V (product no. C 2888, 1000 U) and the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n**Microphatic Assay.** The AChE inhibitory activity of compounds **1**-**3 was evaluated using the modified methods of Ellman et al. and Rhee et al. in a 96-well microplate, as previously described.13 Using this method, the enzyme hydrolyzes the substrate acetylcholinesterase electrophitocholine, resulting in the production of thotocholine, which reacts with 5,5'-ditibiohs(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate\\(\\rightarrow\\)5-mercaptoethanolcholine and 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate and can be detected at 405 nm. To the 96-well plates were added 25 \\(\\mu\\)L of an aqueous solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (15 mM), 125 \\(\\mu\\)L of DTNB (3 mM) in buffer C, 50 \\(\\mu\\)L of buffer B, and 25 \\(\\mu\\)L of sample diluted in buffer A, to give a range of concentrations from 0.78 to 100 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s three times. Furthermore, 25 \\(\\mu\\)L of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme was added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min two times. Any increase in absorbance due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the rate of the reaction before the addition of the enzyme from the rate of the enzyme reaction. The percentage of inhibition was calculated in comparison to a blank (10% MeOH in buffer A), and a positive control of physposition was used in the same range of concentrations. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8); buffer B, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction; buffer C, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.10 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl\\({}_{2}\\)-6H\\({}_{2}\\)O.

SILVA\\(\\dagger\\)*\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n_Styrax camporum_ Pohl (Styracaceae), known in Brazil as \"estoraque do campo\" or \"cuia de brejo\", grows in the States of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais and is popularly used in gastrointestinal diseases [1]. Its reported uses have led to a study of the composition and antiulcer activity of the crude extract of the bark and the trunk [2]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the bark of _S. camporum_ has resulted in the isolation of homoegonol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, sitosterol, vanillin and esters of cinnamic and ferulic acids [3]. The present article deals with the isolation from stems of _S. camporum_, and the identification and cytotoxicity evaluation of two benzofuran lignans, egonol (**1**) and homoegonol (**2**), and one furofuran lignan, (\\(\\pm\\))springaresinol (**3**),\n\n## Page 4\n\noriginally isolated from _Styrax obassia_[4, 5] and _Forsythia intermedia_[6], respectively. Lignans are known to possess several biological activities [7-11], including antitumor, e.g., some podophyllotoxin derivatives, currently in clinical use, and cytotoxic, e.g., the benzofuran lignan licarin A which is active against KB cells. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compounds **1-3** against C6, Hep-2 and HeLa human carcinoma cells, the MTT spectrophotometric assay was used.\n\n## 2 Experimental\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe stems of _S. camporum_ Pohl were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guacu, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen (Young 07 - SP) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. 1H, 13C-NMR, DEPT and COSY spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-D6 using TMS as internal standard on a Bruker AC 200 or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS, on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. CC was performed over silica gel 60, 70-230 or 230-400 mesh or Sephadex LH-20 (Merck). TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and/or by spraying with 2% anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe dried and powdered stems of _S. camporum_ (470.0 g) were extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue (57.2 g) was taken up in aqueous MeOH (MeOH-H2O 80 : 20; 200 mL) and subsequently extracted with hexane. Sufficient water was added to the aqueous methanol fraction to make it up to 60% aqueous MeOH, which was extracted with CHCl3 followed by EtOAc. The CHCl3 fraction (3.8 g) was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane-EtOAc 1 : 1 v/v (A), CHCl3 (B), EtOAc (C), CHCl3-CH3OH 1 : 1 v/v (D), MeOH (E) and H2O (F) (300 mL each). After evaporation, fraction A (370 mg) was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (98 : 2) and 62 fractions (15 mL each) were collected. Combined fraction 6-15 afforded **1** (34.3 mg, CHCl3-MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.26) and the combined fraction 17-18 afforded **2** (11.7 mg, CHCl3-MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.50). Fraction C (630 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 19 fractions (10 mL each) were collected. Combined fractions 2-7 (363 mg) were rechromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 52 fractions (3 mL each) were collected. Purification of the combined fractions 31-41 (98 mg) by prep. TLC (eluent CHCl3-MeOH 92 : 8) yielded **3** (5.1 mg, CHCl3-MeOH\n\n## Page 5\n\n85 : 15, Rf 0.61). All known compounds were identified with the help of UV, IR, MS and NMR, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nCellular viability in the presence and absence of test compounds was determined using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, Dorset, U.K.) microculture assay [12]. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase reduces MTT to a blue formazan product with an absorbance at 560 nm in DMSO. Cells harvested in the log phase of the growth were counted and seeded (5 x 104 cells/well in 1 mL) in 48-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37degC under 4.3% CO2 to allow cell attachment, cultures of the Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were treated with several test compound concentrations. Three replicate wells were set up for each experimental condition. After another 24 h incubation period, MTT (100 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution) was added, the plate was incubated for 3 h and unreduced MTT was removed. Acid isopropanol (HCl 0.3%; 100 mL) was added to dissolve the blue formazan. The absorbance at 560 nm was read by using a Pharmacia LKB-Ultrospec III spectrophotometer. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of test compound \n\n## Page 6\n\nresulting in a 50% reduction of absorbance compared to untreated cells in the MTT assay. Absorbances taken from cells grown in the absence of drugs were taken as 100% cell survival (control). For each compound the percent viability was plotted against concentration and the IC50 (concentration required to reduce viability by 50%) values were calculated for the three cell lines. This experiment was also performed with a positive control anticancer agent: streptonigrin.\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\nThe isolated lignans: egonol, homoegonol and (+-) syringaresinol were evaluated for their cytotoxicities by the MTT method in the three cell lines: Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma). Each compound was tested at five different concentrations. The concentration-response curves thus generated were used to calculate the IC50 (table 1).\n\nThe cytotoxic activity was expressed in terms of relative absorbance of drug-treated cells, in comparison to control cells. The results show a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect relationship for all the lignans and all the cell lines evaluated. Significant activities (IC50 < 10 mg/mL) could be observed for egonol against C6 and Hep-2 cell lines and for homoegonol against C6 and HeLa cells, when compared to the positive control streptonigrin activity (table 1). The activity of egonol against HeLa cells, homoegonol against Hep-2 cells as well as the activity of syringaresinol, the only furofuran neolignan under investigation in this study towards the three cell lines were moderate. It is interesting to note the significant differences of activity related to the lignan structure.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo) and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - Brazil) for financial support of this work, and fellowships to H.L.T., J.P.H., P.M.P. and J.R.C.P.\n\n## References\n\n* Manual de identificacao e cultivo de plantas arboreas nativas do Brasil_, Vol. 1, p. 332, Instituto Plantarum de Estudos da Flora, Sao Paulo (1982).\n* [2] E.M.

The sample was dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure, dissolved in 4.0 ml of methanol and filtered through 0.22 mm membrane filter (PVDF Millipore(r)) into a _high performance liquid chromatography_ (HPLC). Val. The reference standard used in this work-casegrewin F and caseinum(r)--was purified and identified in the laboratories of Nucleo de Bioensaios, Biossinstee e Ecofisologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sao Paulo State University, Aaraquara, Brazil; for details see Santos _et al._ (10). The standard solutions were prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of caseinregwein F into a volumetric flask. After diluting with methanol, the standard solutions (0.0079, 0.0159, 0.0635, 0.2540 e 0.5080 mg/ml) were filtered through 0.22 mm membrane filter (PVDF Millipore(r)) into a HPLC vial before injections. Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Variany Proxst system (comprising a model 240 pump, a 140 autosampler and a 330 photodiode array detector), with control and data handling managed by Star50 Chromatography software. Analysis was conducted using a Phenomerex(r) Gemini C-18 column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 um) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile: methanol water (from 44:23:4 to 47:53:00, v/v, in 42 min) and acetonitrile: methanol (53:47), v/v, in 5 min); flow rate 0.8 ml/min; detection range 210-400 nm; injection volume 20 ml. Analysis was realized in triplicate.\n\n### Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis\n\nA 5.0 mg of dried extract was submitted to SPE (2 x 1 cm) from silica gel (60-200 mm; Merck(r):) activated charcoal (Synthe(r)) (1:1, w/v) eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate (95:05, v/v, 5.0 ml). The sample was dried and diluted in hexane to afford 1.0 mg/ml solution. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector using a DB-5 column (30 mx 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm). The carrier gas was He at a flow rate of 1.33 ml/min, split mode with ratio of 1:20 and injection volume of 1 ml. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 250degC, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 60degC, with an increase of 3degC/min, to 240degC. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted using the same system and conditions interfaced to a mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an ion trap detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The compounds were identified by their retention indexes, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes (11) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7.0 library and of the literature (11). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas.\n\n### \\({}^{1}\\)H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis\n\nDried extract was diluted in CDCl3 (50.0 mg/ml) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA(r) 500 11.4 T instrument with CHCl3 as internal standard.\n\n### Ethanolic extract emulsions\n\nThe ethanolic extract of _C.slyestris_ was dissolved in Tween 20 (20%). Ball-C male mice were treated with 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. The concentrations of the test were chosen based on the high solubility of the ethanolic extract in the Tween 20 (20%).\n\n### Purification and structure determination of casegrewin F\n\nDried and powdered leaves of _C.slyestris_ were extracted by stepping in ethanol. The dried extract obtained was separated by SPE on silica gel: activated charcoal and fraction SPE was separated further by normal-phase low-pressure column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. Fractions CC15-19 were purified by preparative reversed-phase (Cl3) HPLC to yield casegrewin F (850.0 mg). The structure of the compound was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. For details see Santos _et al._ (10). The Microfluidic purify of the caasgrewin F in the assays used was 98.6% (HPLC-UV detected at 235 nm).\n\n### Caseagrewin F emulsions\n\nCaseagrewin F (Figure 1) was emulsified in 6% Tween 80 for both assays in mice. The Ball-C male mice were treated with 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg of casegrewin F per kg body weight (D-w.). These concentrations were based on ethanolic extract from _C.slyestris_ in which doses of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. were used; since casegrewin F represents 4% of the ethanolic extract, we selected doses that are ~4% of the ethanolic extract doses.\n\n### Animals\n\nSix-week-old Ball-C male mice were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (22 +- 2degC) and humidity (55 +- 10% room humidity), in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized for 1 week, during which they had free access to a commercial diet (Purina(r)) and water. The study was conducted with approval of Brazilian Ethics Committee to Experimentation Animals (process CEP/FCF/CAr ndeg 01/2006).\n\n### Mutagenic chemical-Positive control\n\nCyclophosphamide (CP, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, Lot. No. 036K1225, purity 99%) was used as mutagenic agent in experiments. CP was diluted in 0.95x NaCl just before use and the animals were exposed to the chemical by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg b.w. in 0.3 ml.\n\n### Mutagenicity--MN test\n\n### Experimental design\n\nThe assays were performed using eight animals/group. Group 1 (negative control) mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection of 0.3 ml. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and was treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%). 0.6 ml by gavage, for 2 weeks and on day 15 the mice were injected i.p. with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl. Groups 4-9 were treated for 2 weeks by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with various concentrations of ethanolic extract (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) or casegrewin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.). These groups also received treatment with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl by ip on day 15. Bone marrow from each animal was collected 24 h after the last administration (12).\n\nThe bone marrow MN test was carried out as described by Schmid (13). All slides were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and coded to avoid observer bias. For each experiment point, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were scored to determine the percentages of micronucleated PCE. The ratio of PCEs to monochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) (PCEs/NCEs) was determined in 200 cells.\n\n### Genotoxicity--comet assay\n\nFor the comet assay, the experimental design was the same as for the MN test in mice. Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized capillary vials and kept on ice until use. The alkaline version of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) was performed as described by Singh (14). Briefly, 20 ml of blood was taken, homogenized with low-melting point agarose, spread on microscope slide pre-coated with normal melting point agarose and covered with a coverslip. After 5 min at 4degC, the coverslip was removed from slides and they were immersed in cold lysing solution (2.4 M NaCl: 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). 10 mM Tris, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 1% Triton-X, pH 10) for 24 h. After lysis, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber, covered with electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH plus 1 mM EDTA, pH 7-13) and left for 20 min for the DNA to unwind. The electrophoresis was run for 20 min (25 V and 300 mA), after which the slides were submerged for 15 min in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and fixed in 96% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were prepared in duplicate with ethidium bromide and 50 cells were screened per sample in a fluorescent microscope (ZEISS(r), Germany) equipped with an excitation filter of 515-560 nm, a barrier filter of 590 nm and a 40 objective. The level of\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structure of caseagrewin F.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nDNA damage was assessed by an image analysis system (TriTek CometScore(tm) 1.5, 2006) and the percentage of DNA in tail was obtained.\n\n#### Antimagenicity--MN test\n\n_Experimental design_ In Group 1 (negative control), mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and were treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with 0.6 ml Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%) by gavage, for 2 weeks, and on day 15 received CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.); the aim of this group is to ensure that Tween has no influence in possible DNA protective effect. Groups 4-9 were treated by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with solutions of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) and casegrewin F (0.16, 32.0, 6.3, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 2 weeks and, on day 15, CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p) was administered. Bone marrow was taken 24 h of CP after the injection (12). The MN test was performed as described previously for the mutagenicity assays.\n\n#### Antigonotoxicity--comer assay\n\nThe experimental design for the Comet assay was the same as for antimutagenicity MN test and the comet assay for antimuotoxicity was carried out as described for the genotoxicity assay. Recently, Collins _et al_. (15) described that when comet assay is performed in _in vivo_ experiments low concentrations of genotoxic agents are unlikely to induce significant cytotoxicity, they also affirm that a low comet assay DNA damage would be a better indicator that cells are alive than common cytotoxicity tests. In this context, to the comet assay we did not performed cytotoxicity test once at low concentrations, the compounds were not genotoxic and consequently did not present cytotoxicity that could influence in antigenotoxicity assay.\n\n#### Statistical analysis\n\nFor a statistical interpretation, results were analyzed with Sigma Stat 3.5, Systat, CA. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test data for normal distribution, in all assays performed in the study. Since the results did not a show normal distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. In mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays, the Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test was used to compare DNA damage with the negative control. In the MN test, the PCE/NCE ratio was evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis test. In antimutagenicity/antigenotoxicity assays, Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test was used to compare all groups tested with the Tween 20 (20%) plus CP group, to assess the decrease in DNA damage. To test whether any groups demonstrated significant reduction in DNA damage to basal levels, those groups were also compared with negative control by the Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test.\n\n## Results\n\n### Identification of compounds in the extract\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum from extract showed signals with absorptions in d 1.98-2.09, 2.20-2.40, 3.43, 5.07-5.45, 6.25-6.75, similar to those described for casearins and other clerodane diterpenes isolated from _C.sylvestris_ (10,16-18). Both casearin U and caseargrewin F were identified in the extract. However, casearin U was not assayed in the present study. Quantitative High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector analysis demonstrated that the content of caseargrewin F in the extract was 40.0 mg/g. Additionally, the chromatogram (Figure 2) presented 29 peaks with UV spectrum similar to observed for casearins and caseargrewin F (\\(\\lambda_{\\max}=231\\)-236 nm). The results of chemical analysis suggest the presence of these clerodane diterpenes in the extract.\n\n#### Mutagenicity and genotoxicity--ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris\n\nThe results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) for ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ are shown in Table I. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were observed at 50 and 75 mg/kg (both \\(P\\) < 0.01). The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically significant variation, indicating that there was no cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow cells.\n\n#### Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris\n\nTable II shows the protective effect of the ethanolic extract from _C.sylvestris_ against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. Since Tween 20 (20%) was used to dissolve the ethanolic extract, in the vehicle control this solution was administered before the CP to ensure that it has no influence on the antimutagenic effect of the test group. Consequently, there is no difference between Tween 20 (20%) plus CP and positive control. When the protective effect was evaluated by the MN test, an antimutagenic effect was observed in mice treated with 6.25 (_P_ < 0.01) and 12.5 mg/kg (_P_ < 0.05). However, the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ did not reduce the DNA damage to the basal level. In the comet assay, the ethanolic extract from _C.sylvestris_ significantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 3.13 (_P_ < 0.01), 6.25 (_P_ < 0.01), 12.5 (_P_ < 0.05) and 25 mg/kg (_P_ < 0.05).\n\n#### Mutagenicity and genotoxicity--caseargrewin F\n\nThe results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ are shown in Table III. Clastogenicity and primary damage were observed at 3.8 mg/kg b.w. of caseargrewin F (both \\(P\\) < 0.05)\n\nFig. 2: Results from HPLC-DAD analysis. (**A**) Chromatogram of extract from the leaves of _Casearia syhestris_; asterisk (*) indicates peaks with UV spectrum similar to casearins and caseargrewin F. (**B**) Caseargrewin F UV spectrum.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nin, respectively, the MN test and comet assay. The parameter used to assess genotoxicity by comet assay was % DNA in tail. The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically significant variation, indicating that caseargrewin F was not cytotoxic to mouse bone marrow cells.\n\n#### Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of caseargrewin F\n\nThe antimutagenesis/antigenotoxicity assays were performed to determine if caseargrewin F protects DNA from inducible damage (CP, 50 mg/kg b.w.). Table IV shows the protective effect of caseargrewin F against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. In the positive control, water was administered before CP, in order to maintain the same conditions as in the test groups (gavage intake) while determining the DNA damage induced by the CP without protection. To verify that Tween 80 has no influence on the antimutagenic effect in the test group, we administered the emulsifying solution before the CP. The negative control was used to check basal levels of DNA damage. The caseargrewin F did not show a statistically significant protective effect when assessed by the MN test. However, in the comet assay, it significantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 0.63 (_P_ < 0.01), 1.3 (_P_ < 0.01) and 2.5 (_P_ < 0.01) mg/kg b.w.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\ngenotoxic at the highest dose of 3.8 mg/kg b.w. A similar result was obtained in a recent study that describes mutagenic and genotoxic activity at high concentrations of another clerodane diterpene assessed by the MN test and comet assay (22). Considering that comet assay detects genomic lesions that are susceptible to DNA repair while MN test reveals more drastically lesions in chromosome level (23), it is important to realize that the two highest concentrations of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and at the high concentration case-argreiin F induced unrepairable DNA damage. A mutagenic effect of the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewini F could represent a potential antimuour property, as previous works on _C.sylvestris_ demonstrated strong antimuour activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (17) and its casearins (clerodane diterpenes) exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against V-79 tumour cells (18).\n\nInterestingly, in the comet assay, the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ was more efficient at preventing primary DNA damage at low concentrations (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). The molecules with non-mutagenic and/or antimutagenic properties could have antioxidant properties and, sometimes, may activate DNA repair pathways (24). They may act directly on the mutagenic process, by increasing the fidelity in DNA replication (desmutagens) or by stimulating DNA damage error-free repair (bio-antimutagenesis) (25). Additionally, ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ did not presented a dose-dependent response in both comet assay and MN test, and this result can be affected by various associated factors such as dependence of the effect of the substance on dose, the complexity of the test organism and the influence of simultaneous metabolic routes and enzymatic pathways (26). Caseargrewin F was not antimutagenic when assessed by the MN test, but showed an antigenotoxic dose-dependent response in the comet assay over the range of 0.63-2.5 mg/kg b.w. (Table IV).\n\nIn accordance with the present work, previous study has demonstrated that essential oil of _C.sylvestris_ has classetogenicity and anticlastogeneity in HTC cell line (27). Monoterpens and sesquiterpenes were identified in the essential oil (28) whereas in the present study, sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes were identified in the ethanolic extract. Among 15 sesquiterpenes identified in the ethanolic extract, 13 were previous identified in essential oil (11,28). The mutagenic and genotoxic activity as well as the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ could be related to the sesquiterpenes. Additionally, there are recent studies that describe sesquiterpenes as chemopreventive (27,29). However, we cannot exclude the potential biological effects of the clerodane diterpenes since caseargrewin F protected DNA from primary damage. Moreover, the use of mice instead of cell lines to assess protective effect of ethanolic extract could better verify absorption and metabolism of _C.sylvestris_ in a complex organism.\n\nRecently, natural products have been described to protect DNA from damage and cause DNA damage (30,31) as observed in the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F. Similar results were obtained in earlier studies and described these products as Janus compounds, referring to the mythological Roman god Janus, who had two faces in the same: one looking forward and the other backward (32). Comet assay also revealed that _C.sylvestris_ exhibited chemoprotective effects, but was not able to reduce the levels of DNA damage to negative controls values. Other studies suggested similar effects. Santos and Takahashi (33) demonstrated that selenomethionine, a selenium-derived antioxidant compound, was both genotoxic and antigenotoxic and reduced the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, but not to values as low as the negative control.\n\nCytotoxic events could lead to overestimation of the chemoprotective effects observed here. Thus, it is also important to consider that _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F did not exhibit cytotoxic effects alone neither in combination with the CP as observed in the PCE/NCE values. Likewise, the chemoprotective effects can be considered only in the concentrations that did not exhibit genotoxic effects, a recommendation of the publication of Zeiger (34). Thus, our results demonstrate that the benefits of using ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F as DNA protective compounds could be respectively safe at doses <50 mg/kg b.w. and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.\n\nWe conclude that the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F protects DNA against damage in low concentrations, which was carefully estimated by using MN test and comet assay. Keeping in mind that the same ethanolic extract and caseargrewin F also can cause DNA damage in high concentrations.\n\n## Funding\n\nFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) (2005/58472-9) to A.M.d.O.; Biota-FAPESP (2003/02176-7) to V.S.B; Biopropsecta (2004/07932-7) to D.H.S.S.; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento a Pesquisa (305615/2006-8) to C.P.S.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe wish to thank Maximino Antonio Boschi, Marcos Aparecido Dangona and Maria Izabel Feliciano for the excellent technical assistance.\n\nConflict of interest statement: None declared.\n\n## References\n\n- Gonzalez-Avila, M., Arriaga-Alba, M., de la Garza, M., del Carmen Hernandez Pretelin, M., Dominguez-Ortiz, M.

The present study describes the synthesis, the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of a series of 2,3,6-trialkyl-piperidine alkaloids: the natural (-)-3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) and ten semi-synthetic specialine derivatives. Structure-activity relationship (SARs) studies were performed. The structures of all synthesized derivatives were confirmed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance. Compounds were evaluated for their analgesic (acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constrictions, hot-plate test, formalin-in-duced pain test) and some of them for the anti-inflammatory activities (carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test). The pharmacological results showed that several of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 _μ_mU/kg significantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than (-)-spectaline. LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. In the formalin-induced pain only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw lifelong response of the inflammatory phase, (-)-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity. In the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, only (-)-spectaline exhibited an anti-inflammatory profile, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 _μ_mU/kg. Our results suggest different mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio-776 (3-_O_-Bocedaleline), LASSBio-755 (3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline) and (-)-spectaline (LASSBio-754). The antinociceptive profile of some of the semi-synthetic specialine derivatives extends our research concerning the chemical and pharmacological optimization of isolated natural products in the search of new drug candidates from brazilian biodiversity.\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory\n\nAnti-inflammatory\n\n## Page 2\n\nwithing test (ED50=48.5 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg) and capsaicin induced pain (ED50=20.8 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg).[8]\n\nExtending our research program concerning the bio-prospection of natural products and its derivatives, we have selected, to conclude this investigation, another abundant piperidine alkaloid, (-)-3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline (**LASSBio-755**, Chart 1) and synthesized other 10 semi-synthetic derivatives prepared from natural (-)-spectaline, _i.e._ a series of 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloids. The present study was focused on the synthesis, evaluation of antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of these new derivatives in order to verify the stereoelectronic contributions and requirements of the pharmacophoric groups A, B and C for the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities (Chart 1).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe antinociceptive profile of all new 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine derivatives developed herein was initially evaluated using classical acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constriction test,[9] with indomethacin as standard. The results are disclosed in Fig. 1. Some of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg significantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than (-)-spectaline and indomethacin. Among them, the natural acetate derivative (**LASSBio-755**) and its _O_-Boc analogue (**LASSBio-776**) were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. Based on these results some preliminary structure-activity relationships were analysed. Comparing the inhibitory profile of compounds **LASSBio-782**, **LASSBio-821** and **LASSBio-775** with **LASSBio-776** and **LASSBio-755** indicates that the presence of groups that blocked the hydrogen bond donnor character of the piperidine nitrogen seems to be deletery for the analgesic activity. On the other hand, the antinociceptive activity showed to be inversely dependent of the volume of the groups at C-3 (OR1 group) once that the inhibition of the constrictions follows the order R1=H>Ac>Boc. The introduction of more polar and hydrogen bond-donating hydroxy groups at C-13' in the alcohol or oxime derivatives, _i.e._**LASSBio-781**, **LASSBio-820** and **LASSBio-784**, did not result in a increase of the antinociceptive activity but indicated through the direct comparison of the bioprofile of compounds **LASSBio-781** and **LASSBio-820** that the stereochemistry at C-3 seems to be a pharmacophoric requirement for an adequate fit in the target receptor. Additionally, the introduction of an acetyl group at C-3 of **LASSBio-755** modify drastically the toxicological aspect of these alkaloids, once that it did not show any sign of toxicity when administered at a single dose of 500 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg (data not shown) in contrast with (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**).[8]\n\nConsidering the significant antinociceptive activity observed for **LASSBio-755** and its analogue **LASSBio-776** we decided to investigate its effects on other models of pain and compare the results with that showed by (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**).[8] In the formalin-induced pain[10] only **LASSBio-776** was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the inflammatory phase, (-)-spectaline and **LASSBio-755** did show any activity (Fig. 2). Indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the later phase without interfering on the earlier one in the formalin-induced pain test.[11] These results on the formalin-induced pain test led us to investigate the anti-inflammatory profile of these same compounds on the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema.[9]**LASSBio-755** and, unexpectedly, **LASSBio-776** did not show an anti-inflammatory activity at the dose used. Only (-)-spectaline was able to inhibit the edema formation, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg (Fig. 3). The same order of potency was observed for both antinociceptive (ED50=48.5 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg)[9] and anti-inflammatory (ED50=56.6 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg) (Fig. 3) activities of (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**), indicating a common pathway of action.\n\nDespite the absence of effect on the neurogenic phase of the formalin test at the dose used, **LASSBio-755** and **LASSBio-776** showed a significant increase in the latency time in the hot-plate test,[12] similar to morphine, while (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**), even at a dose of 300 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg, was inactive (Fig. 4).\n\nThe hot-plate and formalin test differs in some aspects. Hot-plate test is based on the use of a short-duration nociceptive thermal stimulus (phasic pain) while formalin use a long-duration chemical stimulus (tonic pain). Tissue injury leads to a persistent afferent input in the latter. The nociceptive response in the first phase of formalin and hot-plate models seems to result from direct activation of nociceptors and is inhibited by drugs which act mainly at central sites.[13, 14] Centrally acting analgesics are also effective in the second phase.[10] This phase is attributed mainly to the development of an inflammatory reaction at the site of injection and increased synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.[13]\n\nFig. 1: Effect of the 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Alkaloids and Indomethacin in Mice Abdominal Constrictions Induced by Acetic Acid (0.6%, i.p.)\n\nFig. 2: Effect of (−)-Specttaline (**LASSBio-754**), **LASSBio-755**, **LASSBio-776** and **Indomethacin** in Mice Formalin-Induced Pain Test\n\nEach column represents the mean−5.E.M. (−10 animals per group). *_p_<0.05 (Student’s / test) as compared to the vehicle control group.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nConsidering the central activity observed for **LASSBio-755** and **LASSBio-776** in the hot-plate test, it was expected to observe some activity in the earlier phase of the formalin that could be dependent of the magnitude of the dose. The first phase of formalin is brief and occurs in the first 5 min. The first measure in the hot-plate test was at 30 min and only **LASSBio-755** showed a significant activity. **LASSBio-776** showed a significant activity from 60 min. Since the compounds were administered orally and the dose used was the same in both tests, the lack of activity on the neurogenic phase could be related with the pharmacokinetics profile of the compounds and somewhat with the mechanisms of the pain processing in these different models.\n\nRecently, searching for new candidates compounds useful for treating Alzheimer's disease, the chloride analogues of some of these semi-synthetic piperidine alkaloid derivatives were described as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.15 The cholinergic system was involved in the transmission of nociceptive information and cholinergic drugs, such as muscarinic and nicotinic agonists, and also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were described to induce antinociception.16-18 The acetylcholine-induced constriction test has been used for screening analgesic compounds.19 In this model (-)-spec-taline and **LASSBio-776** similarly inhibited the constrictions by 44.7% and 47.9%, respectively, while **LASSBio-755** showed a more important antinociceptive effect, inhibiting the constrictions by 82% (Fig. 5). These results in addition with the hot-plate test and the acetylcholinesterase inhibition15 suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the antinociceptive response elicited by **LASSBio-776** and **LASSBio-755**.\n\nTaken together these results suggest differents mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for **LASSBio-776** (3-_O_-Boc-spectaline) and **LASSBio-755** (3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline), acting mainly by modulation of receptors located at central nervous system, and for (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**) that showed to be a peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.\n\nIn conclusion, this study revealed new analgesic compounds derived from (-)-spectaline without apparent toxicity and gave support to the strategy of modifications of isolated natural products from brazilian biodiversity seeking the optimization of the biological activities in the search of new drug candidates.\n\n## Experimental\n\n**Chemistry** The natural alkaloids (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**) and (-)-3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline (**LASSBio-755**) were obtained from the ethanolic extract of flowers of _Cassia spectroballs_ (DC).

(Leguminose), as previously described.6,7)\n\nFor the preparation of the target derivatives from (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**) the reaction sequences outlined in Chart 2 were followed. Reaction of **LASSBio-754** with HCl under anhydrous conditions in CH2Cl2 yielded the hidrochloride **LASSBio-768**. Carbamate **LASSBio-775** and carbonate **LASSBio-776** were prepared as a 1:2 mixture, by reaction of **LASSBio-754** with (BOC)/PECl2N in CH2Cl2-32D silver **LASSBio-777** was obtained by reaction of **LASSBio-754** with _tert_-butyl dimethyl ethyl nitrate (TBSOfT)/2,6-lutidine in CH2Cl2,23D Treatment of carbonate **LASSBio-776** with BrCl4-DMAP/EtN23,25D and MSCl/EtN in CH2Cl2, afforded _N_-benzyl carbonized **LASSBio-782** and _N_-methylomethyl carbonate **LASSBio-821**, respectively. Oxidation of **LASSBio-754** under Jones conditions yielded the diketone **LASSBio-766**, that was subsequently reduced with LiAlH4 in THF to afford **LASSBio-782**. Reduction of **LASSBio-754** with NaBH4 in MeOH furnished **LASSBio-781**, that differs from **LASSBio-820** at the absolute configuration on C-3. Finally, **LASSBio-754** was converted into the oxime **LASSBio-784** by reaction with NH2OH-HCl in pyridine/ EtOH27.27\n\nMelting points were determined with a Microquimica MQAP-301 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H- and 1C-NMR spectra were\n\nFig. 4: Time Course Effect of (−)-Spectaline (**LASSBio-754**), **LASSBio-755**, **LASSBio-776** and Morphine in the Hot-Plate Test\n\nData are expressed as mean ±S.E.M.

Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All the isolated flavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory activity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nm on MPO. Additionally, the radical-scavenging capacity of flavones 1--6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox(r).\n\nflavone; _Pterogyne nitens_; myeloperoxidase; antioxidant; radical scavenging\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Plant Material\n\nLeaves of _Pterogyne nitens_ were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (SP204319). The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nm on MPO. Additionally, the radical-scavenging capacity of flavones 1--6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox(r).\n\n### Isotal and Purification\n\nThe shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of _P nitens_ were ground and defatted with _n_-hexane (1.81x3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by macroactin with ethanol (2.71x3) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH: H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EOAc and _n_-butanol. After solvent removal using a tetraoperator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1--E11). Chromatographic purification of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH: H2O: AcOH (46:53:0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; flow rate 10 ml/ml] led to the isolation of compounds (1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH: H2O: AcOH (55:44:5.5), UV detection at 274 nm; flow rate 13 ml/ml], affording compound **3** (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identification as compound **5** (130 mg). The butanol fraction (1.8g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1--B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4--B6 were combined (333 mg) and purified by RP-HPLC (MeOH: H2O: AcOH (68:31:5.0), UV detection at 274 nm and flow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds **2** (66 mg) and **4** (89 mg).\n\n### Radical Scavenging Activity (BSA)\n\nAntisodium activity of compounds **1**--6 was determined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS+ [2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as-reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1--6 and positive controls at various concentrations (33.3--1.7 _μ_m) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 _μ_m DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 degC for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS+ was prepared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mm) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mm potassium persulphate (ratio: 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12--16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS+ stock solution was diluted with KH2PO/K2HPO4 (100 mm, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buffer solution (ratio: 1:8). ABTS+ solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds **1--6** and positive controls (0.5--7.0 _μ_m/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical\n\n## Page 2\n\nscavenging activity. Anti-radical abilities against ABTS5+ and DPPH7 species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition=[1(-(Asample/A)x100], where A is test absorbance without sample (only solvent after free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with compounds **1**-**6** or positive controls.\n\n**Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity** Inhibitory effects of 7-me-thoxyflavones **1**-**6** on MPO were evaluated through guaiacolidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 ms) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mx).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiued (70 mm) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample concentrations of compounds **1**--**6** (0.50-50 nm) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibition expressed in concentration-response curves.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nNitensoside A (**1**) was obtained as yellow amorphous powder. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (_a_,_b_-unsaturated C=O), 1606, 1502, 1452 (C=C, aromatic), and a broad band at 1160 cm-1, indicating the presence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These results strongly suggested that compound **1** is a flavonoid glycososide.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two amomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at \\(d\\) 4.92 (1H, d, _J_=7.0 Hz, H-1''), \\(d\\) 4.45 (1H, d, _J_=1.5 Hz, H-1''), \\(d\\) 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a''), \\(d\\) 3.70 (1H, dd, _J_=10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b''), and \\(d\\) 1.04 (1H, d, _J_=6.0 Hz, H-6'') suggested the presence of one _b_-glucopyranosyl and one _a_-thamopyranosyl unit in compound **1**, which was confirmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at \\(d\\) 102.4 (C-1''), \\(d\\) 100.6 (C-1''), \\(d\\) 66.6 (C-6'') and \\(d\\) 17.7 (C-6''). In the aromatic moiety of compound **1**, signals at \\(d\\) 7.96 (2H, d, _J_=8.5 Hz, H-2', 6'), 6.94 (2H, d, _J_=8.5 Hz, H-3', 5'), 6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4'-trihydroxyfluoxyne).17,19) The singlet at \\(d\\) 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the flavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR resonance at \\(d\\) 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton signal at \\(d\\) 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at \\(d\\) 158.7 (C-7) and \\(d\\) 3.90, which confirmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at \\(d\\) 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations confirmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4'-trihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolin+H]+ ion at _m/z_ 301 observed in first-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound **1**. A cross-peak between the signals for\n\nFig. 1: Structures of Compounds **1**—**6\n\n## Page 3\n\nC-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 128.1) and the anomeric proton (\\(\\delta\\) 4.92) in the gHMBC spectrum indicated the position of the glucopyranosyl unit at C-6 of the flavone moiety. Assignment of the inner sugar resonances was achieved by using the anomeric proton resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (\\(J\\)=7.0 Hz) confirmed the \\(\\beta\\)-linkage of the first glucosyl moiety. The downfield shift of C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) (+5.5 ppm) and upfield shift of C-5\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) (-1.4 ppm) glucopyranosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin-6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside [19], indicated that the rhamnopyranosyl moiety was attached at C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\). Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 100.6 (C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 3.70 (H-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) confirmed the C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-\\(O\\)-C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) interglycosidic linkage of compound **1**. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound **1** showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [M\\(-\\)H]\\({}^{-}\\) at 607.1657 \\(m/z\\), in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C\\({}_{23}\\)H\\({}_{31}\\)O\\({}_{15}\\) (607.1657).\n\nCompound **2** was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at \\(m/z\\) 623.1600 (Caled 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C\\({}_{28}\\)H\\({}_{31}\\)O\\({}_{16}\\). The UV and IR spectra of **2** were similar to those of compound **1** suggesting a 6-\\(O\\)-glucosylflavone derivative. The IR of **2** showed a broad hydroxyl band at 3427 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and an \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), in addition to a C-O stretching band at 1045 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of **2** exhibited absorption maxima typical of a flavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H- and \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR data (Table 1) suggested that compound **2** had the same 7-methoxyflavone skeleton as compound **1**, except for the presence of a hydroxy group at C-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\). In fact, the major difference between compounds **1** and **2** was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at \\(\\delta\\) 7.42 (1H, dd, \\(J\\)=8.5, 2.0 Hz, H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\)), \\(\\delta\\) 7.50 (1H, d, \\(J\\)=2.0 Hz, H-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\)), and \\(\\delta\\) 6.88 (1H, d, \\(J\\)=8.5 Hz, H-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\)) for compound **2**. The \\({}^{1}\\)C-NMR spectrum of compound **2** presented 28 signals, deduced from distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\), DEPT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, fifteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quaternary carbons, including one \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated ketone at \\(\\delta\\) 182.1, which confirmed the flavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC correlation of signals at \\(\\delta\\) 158.7 (C-7) and \\(\\delta\\) 3.88 (OMe) in addition to NOESY interaction of signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.88 and \\(\\delta\\) 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at \\(\\delta\\) 128.0 (C-6) and \\(\\delta\\) 4.89 (H-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)), and between signals at \\(\\delta\\) 66.5 (C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 4.43 (H-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-\\(O\\)-C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) interglycosidic linkage in compound **2**. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures of flavones **1** and **2** were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\alpha\\)-rhamnopyranosyl(1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)6\\({}^{\\prime}\\))-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\alpha\\)-rhamnopyranosyl(1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\))-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyflavones were isolated and identified as sorbifolin (**3**) [20], sorbifolin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**4**) [20], pedalitin (**5**) [20], and pedalitin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**6**) [13].\n\nThe antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay [14, 15]. Pedalitin derivatives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin derivatives, probably due to presence of the _ortho_-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity [21, 22]. Pedalitin derivatives **2**, **5** and **6** showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC\\({}_{50}\\) (_m_M) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC\\({}_{50}\\) values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives **1**, **3** and **4** (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the catheed moiety on the B-ring of flavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin derivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (**5**) when compared to its glucosides **2** and **6** in both assays, evidencing the influence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and therefore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference compound quercetin (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 4.12 _m_M), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones [23]. Similarly, this trend has also been observed for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC\\({}_{50}\\) (5.7 _m_M towards ABTS, and 13.5 _m_M towards DPPH) than its 6-\\(O\\)-glucosyl derivatives **1** and **4**, thus confirming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi-calar activity of 7-methoxyflavones.\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of the effects on mammalian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for flavonoids [24], few studies have been devoted to the MPO inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols [25, 26]. MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modifications [16]. The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds **2**, **5** and **6**, displaying a 3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC\\({}_{50}\\) values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 _m_M, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds **1**, **3** and **4**, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides **1**, **2**, **4** and **6** showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between\n\nFig. 2: Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds **1** and **2**\n\n## Page 4\n\nMPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of flavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inflammation derived diseases.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe association of antiradical properties and MPO inhibitory activity observed for flavones **1**--**6**, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated flavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inflammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme involved in inflammatory processes.\n\n## References\n\n- Barnes P., Chung K.

Naturforsch. **63c**, 371-382 (2008); received June 18/December 7, 2007Hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, and 34 isolated compounds from _Vitex polygama_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg (Myrtaceae) were screened for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ and _T. brucei_, as well as for their enzymatic inhibitory activities on glycosomal glycerolaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and trypanothione reductase (TR) enzymes from _T. cruzi_ and adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) enzyme from _Leishmania tarentolae_. In general, polar extracts displayed strong effects and some of the tested compounds have shown good results in comparison to positive controls of the bioassays.\n\nMyrtaceae, _Trypanosoma_, _Leishmania_\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg commonly known as Uvatinga belongs to the family Myrtaceae and occurs in grasslands (\"campos rupestres\"), deciduous forests (\"cerradoes\") and gallery forests in Goias, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo States of Brazil. This plant takes part in a genus comprising only nine species; two of them are vulnerable to extinction in Sao Paulo State (Programa Biota FAPESP, 2007) and one species, _S. delicata_, has been recently described (Sobral and Proenca, 2006). _S. densiflora_ has been biologically and chemically researched by our group (Gallo _et al._, 2006a, b, c) since neither data about it could be found in the literature nor popular use has been registered.\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and is commonly called \"Taruma\". Its leaf tea is used in folk medicine to treat kidney infections (Rodrigues, 2001; Gallo _et al._, 2008). Several of its compounds had already been characterized and bioassayed (Leitao _et al._, 1997; Leitao and Delle Monache, 1998; Santos _et al._, 2001; Mensor _et al._, 2001), but none was regarded as neither potential trypanocidal nor enzyme inhibitor.\n\nTrypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a complicated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoan agents.\n\nTrypanosomatids have no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and their bloodstream forms are highly dependent on glycolysis to the stage of pyruvate as sole energy supply. Trypanosome glycoly\n\n## Page 2\n\nsis occurs in a specific microbody called glycosome. Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy necessary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD\\({}^{+}\\) and inorganic phosphate. The _in silico_ modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker _et al._, 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spectridine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb _et al._, 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the \\(N^{1}\\),\\(N^{8}\\)-(bisglutathionyl)-spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S]2) to dihydrotrypanothione (T[SH]2). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S]2) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against trypanosomatids (Hamilton _et al._, 2003).\n\nThe genus _Leishmanita_ owns three enzymes involved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and _a_-D-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into adenosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofuranose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid sequence when compared to corresponding mammalian enzymes, which should allow the development of selective inhibitor compounds.\n\nIn our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ and _T. brucei_. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from _T. cruzi_ or APRT enzyme from _Leishmanita tarentolae_, were assessed.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae) and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg (Mytraceae) were collected in July 2000 in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The plants were authenticated by Dr. Fatima Regina Salimena-Pires, a taxonomic botanist from Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF), and Dr. Marcos Sobral from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), respectively. Voucher specimens are deposited at the herbarium of Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras of Universidade de Sao Paulo, campus Ribeirao Preto (SPFR), Brazil, under the acquisition number 9968, and at the Herbarium of Botany Department, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction procedures\n\nExtracts as well as compounds **1** to **3**, **6**, **7**, **9**, **11** to **13**, **20** to **22**, **28** to **34** were obtained in conformity with formerly described procedures (Gallo _et al._, 2006a, b, c, 2008).\n\nIsolation of compound **4** from the methanolic extract of stem of _Siphoeneugena densiflora_ (SD-MS)\n\nA quantity of 60.7 g of SD-MS was submitted to liquid-liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and _n_-butanol).

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), _i. e._, the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentrations, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC50 = 55.5 _m_M).\n\n### _L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activity_\n\nAPRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier described procedures (Thiemann _et al._, 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectrophotometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 _m_L APRT solution. The reaction started by the addition of enzyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira _et al._, 2001).\n\n### _T. cruzi TR inhibitory activity_\n\nEnzyme activity and assay were performed according to prior descriptions (Hamilton _et al._, 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as positive control [IC50 = 2.72 _m_m (personal communication, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC50 value was determined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Imperial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC50 values, and the results were fitted into the equation\n\n\\[\\text{Y} = \\left\\{ {\\text{Range}/\\left[ {1 + (\\text{X}/\\text{IC}_{50})^{\\text{s}}} \\right]} \\right\\} + \\text{Background},\\]\n\nwhere Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in _m_m), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1).\n\n### _T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assay_\n\nBloodstream forms of _T. brucei_, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% serum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of _T. brucei_ was evaluated using the Alamar Blue(r) assay (Raz _et al._, 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 _m_m.\n\n### _T. cruzi cytotoxicity assay_\n\nThe assay was carried out using blood infected with trypanastigotes of _T. cruzi_ \"Y\" strain collected by cardiac puncture in experimentally infected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal murine blood to 2 * 106 trypanastigotes/mL. The assay was performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or compounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 _m_g/mL, 250 _m_g/mL and 100 _m_g/mL. The plates were incubated at 4 degC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC50 = 31 _m_g/mL or 76 _m_M) were run in parallel. The results were expressed as percentage of lysis of trypanastigote forms compared to the DMSO control. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n### _Identification of compounds_\n\nFig. 2 shows the structures of isolated and tested compounds from _S. densiflora_: quercetin **(1)**; quercetin **(2)**; gallic acid **(3)**; aryanbolic acid **(4)**; vanillic acid **(5)**; sitosterol **(6)**; syringic acid **(7)**; 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzoic acid **(8)**; ellagic acid **(9)**; 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde **(10)**; casuarin **(11)**; castalagin **(12)**; ellagic acid 4-_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranoside **(13)**; and from _V. polygamma_: lucolin **(14)**; 3-O-methylquercetin **(15)**; chrysorioenol **(16)**; 3,3'-_O_-dimethylquercetin **(17)**; 3,7,4'-_O_-trimethylkaempferol **(18)**; acacetin **(19)**; isoorientin **(20)**; schaftoside **(21)**; carlinoside **(22)**; penduletin 4'-_O_-methyl ether **(23)**; 2\\(a\\),3_a_-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid **(24)**; oleanolic acid **(25)**; 2\\(a\\),3\\(a\\),19_a_-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid **(26, euscaphic acid); _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid **(27)**; 20-hydroxyec\n\n## Page 6\n\ndysone (**28**, polypodine A); polypodine B (**29**); stachysterone (**30**); shidsterone (**31**); metacrylic acid (**32**); caffeoyl 6-_O_-b_-d-glucopyranoside (**33**); sitosterol 3-_O_-b_-d-glucopyranoside (**34**, daucosterol). The structures of the compounds were elucidated by comparison of their spectral data (1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, HMBC, HSQC, 1H-1H COSY, IE-MS or ESI-MS) with earlier published data (see references in Tables I and II).\n\n### Trypanocidal activity\n\nAmong the 21 extracts and 13 partition fractions tested against trypomastigote forms of _T. cruzi_, 15 revealed significant activities (> 60%, Table III) and were considered as promising sources of active substances.\n\nPartition of VP-HL produced fractions with poorer activities (Table III). 1H NMR analysis of\n\nFig. 2: Structures of compounds isolated from _V. polygamma_ and _S. densiflora._\n\n## Page 7\n\nFig. 2 (continued).\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\nVP-HHL (53%) showed characteristic signals of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. VP-DHL (38%), when submitted to column chromatography, yielded a fraction containing a mixture of steroids which was responsible for 93% of Tc lysis at 500 _m_g/mL (this information is not displayed in the table).

The flavone luteolin (**14**), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduction of the methoxy group at position C-3 (**15**) or C-3' (**16**), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested enzymes (for comparison, see activities of compounds **17**, **18** and **23** in Table II). The _O_-glycosylated flavonoid quercetin (**2**) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone **1**. Lio _et al._ (1985) observed the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activities also performed by compounds **21** and **22** (Table II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I and II). An unseparated mixture of lupool, _a_-amyrin and _b_-amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from _S. densiflora_ (SD-DML), tested at 200 _m_m, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentration, a mixture of compound **24** and its isomer _2a_,3_b_-dihydroxy-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound **24** inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II).\n\n### APRT inhibition\n\nFrom 17 extracts and subfractions tested, eight presented results greater than 60%. Several could not be screened because they absorbed at the same wavelength used in the bioassay. The activity of the methanolic extract from leaves of _S. densiflora_ was increased after fractionation (from 74 to 90%, Table I). Furthermore, quercetin (**1**) as well as quercetin (**2**), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD-EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had activities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I and II). When analyzing the results displayed by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hydroxy groups. Accordingly, compound **29**, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to **28** and two in relation to **30**, was twice more active than **28** and seven times more than **30** (Table II).\n\n### TR inhibition\n\nAll tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (**11**) and castalagin (**12**) which performed an IC50 value of 179.3 _m_m on enzyme inhibition, although this result is not promising in comparison with clomipramine, the positive control.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. Marcos Sobral (UFMG) and Fatima Regina Salimena-Pires (UFJF) for botanical identifications, to ALCOA Aluminio S/A for facilitating the plant collections, to Ahilan Saravanamuthu for supplying TR enzyme, and to Dr. John Lee Richardson for valuable discussions.

The acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn from a culture of _Penicillium_ sp.1 afforded orcinol (**1**). On the other hand, _Penicillium_ sp.1 cultivated in potato-dextrose-broth furnished two different compounds, _cyclo_-(L-Pro-L-Val) (**2**) and uracil (**3**). The chromatographic fractionation of the acetonitrile fraction obtained from _Penicillium_ sp.2 led to three dihydroisocoumarins, 4-hydroxymellein (**4**), 8-methoxyamellein (**5**) and 5-hydroxyamellein (**6**). Compounds **5** and **6** were obtained from the _Penicillium_ genus for the first time. Additionally, metabolites **1-6** were evaluated for their antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. The most active compounds **1** and **4** exhibited detection limits of 5.00 and 10.0 _m_g against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospremum_, respectively. Compound **2** showed a detection limit of 10.0 _m_g, displaying potent AChE inhibitory activity.\n\nkeywords: _Penicillium_, _Alibertia macrophylla_, Endophytic Fungi, Acetylcholinesterase\n\n## Introduction\n\nTerrestrial-derived microfungi have been the sources of several novel and pharmacologically active compounds over decades (Hormazabal _et al._, 2005; Schmeda-Hirschmann _et al._, 2008; Takahashi and Lucas, 2008). In this context, endophytes belonging to the _Penicillium_ genus have been recognized as a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites (Fill _et al._, 2007). Recent examples include the anticancer berkelic acid from _Penicillium_ sp., polyketides with HIV-integrase inhibitory activity from _P. chrysogenum_ and the insecticidal paraheraquamides H and I from _P. cluniae_ (Singh, 2003; Stierle _et al._, 2006).\n\nAs part of our interest for bioactive metabolites from endophytes associated with Brazilian plants (Cafeu _et al._, 2005; Inacio _et al._, 2006; Silva _et al._, 2006; Teles _et al._, 2006), _Alibertia macrophylla_ (Rubiaceae) was selected for our study, due to the fact that this species accumulates a series of bioactive compounds (Bolzani _et al._, 1991; Silva _et al._, 2007).\n\nThus, the major aim of the current study was to identify potential bioactive compounds from _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2, two endophytes associated with _A. macrophylla_ leaves, by using antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory assays.\n\n## Material and Methods\n\n### General\n\n1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), _g_HMBC, _g_HMQC and _g_COSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the solvents as internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer in the ESI mode using MeOH/H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V). TLC was \n\n## Page 2\n\nperformed using Merck silica gel 60 (230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 \\(\\text{PF}_{25}\\) plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde(\\(\\text{H}_{5}\\text{SO}_{4}\\) reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 preparative column (250 mm x 21.2 mm). Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 instrument using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck).\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _Alibertia macrophyla_ K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) was collected in Estacao Ecologica Experimental de Mogi-Guava, Fazenda Campinina, Mogi-Guava, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identification was made by Ph.D. Maria Claudia Marx Young (Institute of Botany, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil (voucher no. SP 370915).\n\n### Isolation and identification of the endophytes\n\nFor isolation of the endophytic fungi, adult and healthy leaves of _A. macrophyla_ were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were first washed with water and soap, and then immersed in an 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and finally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. Sterilized leaves were cut into 2 x 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthramicine sulfate (50 mg/mL) with approx. 3 to 4 pieces on each dish (Silva _et al._, 2006).\n\nThe endophytic fungi were identified according to the characteristics of morphology of the culture and spores, mechanism of spore production, and molecular taxonomy according to a modification of the rapid preparation of DNA from filamentous fungi (Raeder and Broda, 1985). The fungi were identified by Ph.D. Derlene Attil de Angelis (CPOBA-UNICAMP - Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quimicas, Biologicas e Agricolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in our collection with culture numbers 05070032-C and 05-070032-A for _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2, respectively.\n\n### Preparation of the crude extract in corn and potato-dextrose-broth of Penicillium sp.1\n\nThe cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 degC for 40 min. After cool, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC in static mode for 21 d. After the incubation period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 x 250 mL); after that the solvent was evaporated, providing the crude MeOH extract (10.6 g). The methanol extract was dissolved in water and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was suspended in acetonitrile and partitioned with hexane. Evaporation of the organic phase resulted in the crude acetonitrile extract (804 mg).\n\nThe fungus was cultivated using potato-dextrose-broth (PDB) as culture medium (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/L H2O). For the PDB, 20 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) were used, each containing 100 mg of potato extract, 5.0 g dextrose and 250 mL distilled water, which were autoclaved at 125 degC for 15 min. Approx. 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of _Penicillium_ sp.1 were inoculated into each flask, and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 d at 25 degC on rotatory shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration, and the filtrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 x 2.5 L). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase under reduced pressure yielded a brown, solid residue (507 mg).\n\n### Preparation of the crude extract in corn of Penicillium sp.2\n\nThe cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 degC for 40 min. After cooling, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC in static mode for 21 d. After the incubation period, the solid cultures were \n\n## Page 3\n\nground and extracted with EtOAc (6 x 250 mL); after that the solvent was evaporated, providing the crude EtOAc extract (15.0 g). The EtOAc extract was dissolved in acetonitrile and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with hexane. The acetonitrile fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude acetonitrile extract (6.0 g).\n\n### Isolation and identification of compounds **1**-**6_\n\nThe crude acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn of _Penicillium_ sp.1 (804 mg) was fractionated by CC using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/acetonitrile gradient (10-100% acetonitrile) affording 10 fractions (A-J). Fraction D (13.1 mg) afforded compound **1**. The crude EtOAc extract obtained in PDB of _Penicillium_ sp.1 (507 mg) was fractionated by CC using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/acetonitrile gradient (10-100% acetonitrile) affording 5 fractions (K-O). Fraction C (30.5 mg), after recrystallization with MeOH, led to compound **2** (4.5 mg). Fraction L (40.2 mg) was further purified using RP-HPLC [_l_ = 254 nm, 12.0 mL/min, H2O/acetonitrile (9:1, 40 min)] and supplied compound **3** (12.4 mg, _R_t = 3 min).\n\nThe crude acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn of _Penicillium_ sp.2 (6.0 g) was fractionated by CC using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/MeOH gradient (5-100% MeOH) affording 16 fractions (Fr1-Fr16). Fraction Fr2 (18.0 mg) was further purified using RP-HPLC [_l_ = 254 nm, 10.0 mL/min, H2O/acetonitrile (82., 80 min)] leading to compounds **4** (3.4 mg, _R_t = 24.5 min), **5** (5.3 mg, _R_t = 31.1 min) and **6** (6.3 mg, _R_t = 62.3 min).\n\n_Orcinol_ (**1**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 8.97 (2H, _brs_, 1-OH and 5-OH), 6.01 (2H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-2 and H-4), 5.99 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-6), 2.43 (3H, \\(s\\), H-7). - 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 158.1 (C-1, C-5), 138.9 (C-3), 106.9 (C-2, C-4), 99.7 (C-6), 21.1 (C-7).\n\n_Cyclo_(_L_-_Pro_-_L_-_Val_) (**2**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 7.92 (1H, _brs_, H-8), 4.12 (1H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-6), 3.92 (1H, _brs_, H-9), 3.40 (2H, \\(m\\), H-3), 2.35 (1H, _dsept_, \\(J\\) = 2.5, 6.5 Hz, H-10), 2.13 (2H, \\(m\\), H-5), 1.78 (2H, \\(m\\), H-4), 1.02 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, H-12), 0.86 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, H-11). - 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 170.2 (C-7), 165.2 (C-1), 59.5 (C-9), 58.2 (C-6), 44.6 (C-3), 27.7 (C-5, C-10), 22.0 (C-4), 16.4 (C-11), 18.3 (C-12).\n\n_Uracil_ (**3**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 7.38 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-6), 5.41 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-5). - 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 164.4 (C-4), 151.9 (C-2), 142.9 (C-6), 99.9 (C-5).\n\n_4-Hydroxymellein_ (**4**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 11.0 (1H, _brs_, 8-OH), 7.45 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, H-6), 6.96 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-7), 6.86 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-5), 4.63 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 2.0 Hz, H-3), 4.50 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-4), 1.90 (1H, _br_ = 4OH), 1.51 (3H, \\(d\\),\n\n## Page 4\n\ned to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 degC. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol), in order to wash them, and were thoroughly dried just before use. After migration of the sample in a suitable solvent (or direct deposition of sample), the TLC plate was dried for complete removal of the solvent. The plate was then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and thoroughly dried again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was laid flat on plastic plugs in a plastic tank containing a little bit of water; by this means, water did not come directly into contact with the plate but the atmosphere was kept humid. The cover was placed on the tank and incubation was performed at 37 degC for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the 1-naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple colouration after 1-2 min. Galanthamine was employed as positive control (Marston _et al._, 2002).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe molecular structures of all isolates (Fig. 1) were confirmed by the MS and NMR data as shown below. Assignments were based on 2D-NMR experiments including _g_COSY, _g_HMQC, and _g_HMBC.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a brown amorphous powder and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C7H5O2 ([M-H]- at _m/z_ 123). The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** showed two aromatic signals, d_H 5.99 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-6) and d_H 6.01 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, 2H, H-2 and H-4) suggesting a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135deg spectra showed five signals, assigned to one oxygenated aromatic groups at d_C 158.1 (C-1 and C-5), two methines attributed to signals at d_C 99.7 (C-6) and d_C 106.9 (C-2 and C-4) and one methyl group at d_C 21.1 (C-7). The position of the methyl substituent at position C-3 was attributed on the basis on the _g_HMBC experiment, which indicates a correlation of d_H 2.43 (H-7) with d_C 138.9 (C-3) and d_C 106.9 (C-2 and C-4). This data suggests that **1** is orcinol (Monde, 1998).\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H18N2O2 ([M+H]+ at _m/z_ 197). The 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed signals at d_H 0.86 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-11), d_H 1.02 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12), d_H 4.12 (_t_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-6), and d_H 3.92 (_brs_, 1H, H-9). Also, three multiplets at d_H 3.40 (2H, H-3), 1.78 (2H, H-4), and 2.13 (2H, H-5) were observed. Analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum indicated two methyl groups, three methylene carbon atoms and three methine carbon atoms. The signals at d_C 170.2 and d_C 165.2 were attributed to two amide carbonyl groups at C-7 and C-1, respectively, and 1H NMR signals of an amino acid suggested that **2** belongs to the diketopiperazine class. The _g_HMBC cross-peaks between the signal for C-1 and the signals for H-3, H-6, H-9, and H-10, as well as the signal for C-7 and the signals for H-5, H-6, and H-9 confirmed that **2** was biosynthesized by condensation of the amino acids proline and valine. The interpretation of these results combined with comparison with literature data (Furtado _et al._, 2005) suggest that diketopiperazine **2** is _cyclo_-(L-Pro-L-Val).\n\nCompound **3** was isolated as yellow amorphous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C4H4N2O2 ([M-H]- at _m/z_ 111). The 1H NMR spectrum of **3** appeared to be relatively simple, exhibiting two doublets at d_H 5.41 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-5) and d_H 7.38 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-6). The 13C NMR spectrum showed only four signals, for two carbonyl groups [d_C 151.9 (C-2) and d_C 164.4 (C-4)] and two methines [d_C 99.9 (C-5) and d_C 142.9 (C-6)]. These data indicate that **3** is uracil (Schindler, 1998; Martin _et al._, 2007).\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structures of compounds **1–6** isolated from _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nCompound **4** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M+Na]+ at _m/z_ 217). The 1H NMR spectrum showed doublets for three aromatic protons at _d_H 6.86 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-5), _d_H 6.96 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-7) and _d_H 7.45 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, 1H, H-6). Altogether these signals suggest that **4** presented a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The _g_COSY cross-peaks of the doublet at _d_H 1.51 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-9) coupled to a methine hydrogen atom with a signal at _d_H 4.63 (_dq_, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-3) in turn coupled to a methine hydrogen atom at _d_H 4.50 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-4), suggesting an _a_-methylhydroxy unit in the molecular structure of **4**. The broad singlet at _d_H 11.0 (1H) indicated the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a hydroxy group (8-OH) and a carbonyl group (C-1). The 13C NMR and DEPT 135deg spectra showed the presence of ten signals, assigned to one methyl [_d_C 16.0 (C-9)], five methine groups [_d_C 78.1 (C-3), _d_C 67.2 (C-4), _d_C 118.5 (C-5), _d_C 136.7 (C-6), _d_C 118.2 (C-7)], and three aromatic quaternary carbon atoms [_d_C 162.1 (C-8), _d_C 106.8 (C-8a), _d_C 140.5 (C-4a)], and one signal at _d_C 169.1 (C-1), which was attributed to a carbonyl group, suggesting that **4** is an dihydro-isocumarin. This information coupled to data of the literature (Holler _et al._, 1999) assigne **4** to the structure of 4-hydroxymellein.\n\nCompound **5** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C11H12O3 ([M+H]+ at _m/z_ 193). In particular, a high similarity between the NMR spectral data of compounds **5** and **4** was observed. The major difference was identified in the chemical shifts attributed to H-4 of **5**, which showed a multiplet at _d_H 2.80 (2H, H-4). Furthermore, the presence of a singlet at _d_H 3.88 (3H, H-10) suggested a methoxy substituent. A _g_HMBC correlation was observed between the signal at _d_C 161.2 (C-8) and H-10, which confirmed the position of the methoxy group at C-8. This information coupled to literature data (Kamisuki, 2007) assigne **5** to the structure of 8-methoxymellein.\n\nThe dihydroisocumarin **6** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M-H]+ at _m/z_ 193). Considering differences in the NMR spectral data between compounds **5** and **6**, the 1H NMR spectrum of **6** exhibited two ortho-coupled hydrogen atoms at _d_H 6.73 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-7) and _d_H 6.92 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-6), suggesting a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135deg data indicated signals at _d_C 156.5 and _d_C 143.0, which where attributed to the hydroxylated aromatic carbon atoms C-8 and C-5, respectively. These data indicate a hydroquinone ring in the molecular structure of **6**, which was identified as 5-hydroxymellein (Harwood, 1984).\n\nCompounds **1**-**6** were evaluated for their antifungal activity against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ using a direct bioautography assay (Table I). The most active compounds, orcinol (**1**) and 4-hydroxymellein (**4**), showed a potent effect towards the yeasts, exhibiting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 _m_g against _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_, respectively. **5** exhibited moderate fungitoxicity towards _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 _m_g, re\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Compound & Antifungal activitya & Acetylcholinesterase \\\\  & _Cladosporium_ & _Cladosporium_ & inhibitory activitya \\\\  & _cladosporioides_ & _sphaerospermum_ & \\\\\n**1** & 5.00 & 10.0 & 60.0 \\\\\n**2** & 50.0 & 50.0 & 10.0 \\\\\n**3** & 25.0 & 25.0 & 60.0 \\\\\n**4** & 5.00 & 10.0 & 30.0 \\\\\n**5** & 10.0 & 25.0 & \\textgreater{}100 \\\\\n**6** & 50.0 & 50.0 & \\textgreater{}100 \\\\ Nystatinb & 1.00 & 1.00 & – \\\\ Galanthaminec & – & – & 1.00 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable I: Antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of compounds **1**–**6**.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nspectively. 5-Hydroxymellein (6) proved to be not potent, since the content at which this compound showed activity was 50 _m_g. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydroisocumarins and free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8. The identification of the compounds **1**, **4** and **5**, potentially bioactive against the phytopathogenic fungi, indicates that they act as defence of the host species against possible attacks of pathogens.\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for compounds isolated from _Penicillium_, few studies have been devoted to the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to terminate the impulse-transmitted action through cholinergic synapses (Stryer, 1995; Sigurdsson and Gudbjarnason, 2007). Although the fundamental reason of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not clear so far, AD is firmly associated with impairment in the cholinergic transmission. A number of AChE inhibitors have been considered as candidates for the symptomatic treatment of AD as the most useful relieving strategy (Barbosa-Filho _et al._, 2006; Alarcon _et al._, 2008). The diketopiperazine 2 exhibited the highest AChE inhibitory activity displaying a detection limit of 10.0 _m_g (Table I). Compounds **1** and **3** showed a detection limit of 60 _m_g, which was considered as weakly potent. The dihydrosiocoumarin **4** displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 30.0 _m_g. On the other hand, compounds **5** and **6** were not active (detection limits over 100 _m_g). Similar to the observed antifungal activity, free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8 corroborate to increase the anti-AChE potency presented by dihydrosiocoumarins.\n\nIn conclusion, six metabolites from _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2, two endophytes associated with _A. macrophylla_ leaves, exhibited potential bioactivity, including antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results suggest that compounds **2** and **4** should be considered further in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for the use in the drug design for Alzheimer's disease treatment.\n\n###### Acknowledgements.\n\n This work was funded by grants of the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) as part of Biota-FAPESP,The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br), grant no. 03/02176-7, awarded to V.

In the bioautography assay against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _Cladosporium spharoospermum_, compounds 1 and 2 were found to be active while compounds 3, 4 and 5 did not show antifungal activity.\n\nKeywords: endophytic fungus; _Xylaria_ sp.; antifungal compounds.\n\n**INTRODUCAO**\n\nVarios produtos naturais com propriedades teraquticas foram isolados de especies de fungos, especialmente agentes quimicaterpicos, como penicilinas e cefalosporinas usadas ate hoje como antibioticos; mevinolina, um agente redutor de celosterol; bicomicinas, daunorubicinas e analigos, como agentes antitumoraris; avermectina B, um anti-helmmittico de largo espectro, entre outros1,2. Recentemente, o aumento de infecceses fungicas causadas por fungos oportunistas, como _Candida e Aspergillus_, e a resistencia microbiana a uma serie de antibiotics disponviel no mercado estao importanto, novamente, as compensahias farmauceutas a investirem na busca por substancias antifringicas de fontes naturais2.\n\nDentre os microorganismos que acumulam substancias antifungicas, fungos e leveluras destacam-se pela quantitadde de produtos farmaceuticos de uso corrente na medicina com tais pro-priedades.\n\nOs fungos filamentosos, onde ondofiticos estao incluidos, constituent um grupo de microorganismos que biosintetizam uma quantitadde fantastica de metabolitos secundarios, chegando, em casos especiais, a uma producao 73% superior a de outras classes de microorganismos3. Fungos endofilitos sao microorganismos que habitam o interior de plantas e constituent-se em uma fonte valiosa de produtos bioativos4. Este nicho de fungos associados a especies vegetais de Cerrado de da Mata Atlantica permanece praticamente seme qualquer estudo quimico e biologico sendo, portanto, uma fonte potencial de substancias de interesse farmaccojocico.\n\nDando continuidade as nossas pesquisas de bioprospeccao, varia as especies vegetais de Cerrado e Mata Atlantica foram selecionadas para isolamento e cultivo de fungos endofilitos. De _Paliocurea marcgravii_ St. Hil., uma Rubiaceae de larga ocorrencia no Cerrado, e conhecida populamente como \"erva de rato\" ou \"cafe bravo\", foram isolados varios fungos endofilitos. Dentre os ja identificados, _Xylaria_ sp. foi selecionado para estudo devido a atividade apresentada por seu extrato bruto frente aos fungos fitopatogenicos _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ e _Cladosporium sphaerosgperrum_, indicando a producao de metabolios com atividade antifungica em potencial. _Xylaria_ sp. foi subnettido aos procedimentos usuats de cultivo em larga escala para fornecimento dos extractos brutos que apos fracionamento bioguiado, levou ao isolamento de 5 substancias: acido 2-hexilideno-3-metilbutanodioico (**1**), citocalasina D (**2**), 7-dechlorogriseofulvina (**3**), citocalasina B (**4**) e grisefonlvia (**5**) (Figure 1).\n\n**PARTE EXPERIMENTAL**\n\n**Procedimentos experimentalis gerais**\n\nOs espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{10}\\)C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectrometro Varian INOVA-500 operando a 500 MHz para o nucleo de \\({}^{1}\\)H e em 125 MHz para o nucleo de \\({}^{13}\\)C; TMS foi utilizado como referencia intema. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrometro de massas de biaixa resoluco FISONS- Modelo VG Platform II, to modo Electrosrapy. As analises cromatogrificas por CLAE no modo analificar foram utilizadas em equipamento ProStar da Varian acoplado ao detetor ProStar 330 de arranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analifica Phenomenex Fenil-Hexil (250 x 4,60 mm; 5 \\(\\mu\\)m). No modo preparativo, as analises por CLAE foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar da Varian acoplado a detetor ProStar UV, utilizando coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexil (250 x 21,20 mm; 10 mm). Nas separacoes cromatogrificas em columa abertas o sob presso foam utilizadas silica gel C-18 (Merck) e Sephadex LH-20 (Merck) como fases estacionarias. Para cultivo de _Xylaria_ sp. em meio liquido foram utilizados 20 fracsos de Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo preparado a partir de agua Mili-Q e PDB (DIFCO), posteriormente submetto a esterilizacao em autoclave a 121 \\({}^{\\rm C}\\) e 1 atm de presaao por 20 min. Para cultivo em meio solido de milho foram colocados 90 g de milho descascado (Yoki) em 2 Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 75 mL de agua destida. Estes meios foram autoclavados quatro vezes (4 das) por 40 min a temperatura de 121 \\({}^{\\rm C}\\) e 1 atm de presao.**\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nA especie vegetal _Paliecurea marcgravii_ St. Hil. (Rubiaceae) foi coletada, em junho de 2001, na Estacao Ecologica Experimental de Mogi-Guacu (SP). Uma exsicata do material vegetal identificado encontra-se depositada no Herbario do Instituto de Botanica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente de Sao Paulo (SP).\n\n## Isolamento da cepa fungica\n\nO fungo endofitico foi isolado de folhas sauderies de _Paliecurea marcgravii_. As folhas foram lavadas com qaue a sabao e esterilia-das por imperaio em NaClO 1% (5 min) e em etand 70% (1 min), seguatias de lavagen com aqua esteril (10 min) e secagem'. Apos o processo de esterilia?acao, as folhas foram cortadas e incubadas em placa s de Petri contendo PDA, as quais foi adicionado o antibioti-co sulfato de antamicina (50 mg/mL) para evitar crescimento de bacterias contaminantes. Repiques sucessivos em placa s de Petri contendo PDA resultaram no isolamento de 4 linhagens codificadas com PM-01, PM-02, PM-03 e PM-04. Estas linhagens foram preservadas em frascos esterilia?ados com agua. A linhagen PM-03, identificada como _Xylaria_ sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning, Departamento de Fitpotatologia da Universidade Federal de Lavras - MG, foi selecionada para estudo quimico, visando a obtencao das substancias bioativas.\n\n## Cultivo do microorganismo e obtencao dos extratos brutos\n\nA cepa fungica de _Xylaria_ sp. foi repicada em placa de Petri contendo PDA e incubada por 7 dias. Apos este periodo, o fungo foi incubada dos meios de cultivo liquido (PDB) e solido (Milho). Em PDB, _Xylaria_ sp. foi cultivada em 4000 mL de meio (20 frascos de Erlenmeyers de 500 mL) e mandita em incubadora rotatoria (\"shaker\") sob temperatura controlada (24 \"C) por aproximadamente 28 dias, fornecendo o caldo fermentado. O caldo foi submetido a filtracao para separacao dos micellos e a particao liquido/liquido com AcOEt que, apos a evaporacao do solvente, forneceu 2,0 g do extrato bruto acetate de etila (PDB-AcOEt). _Xylaria_ sp. tambem foi cultivada em incubido milho, onde permaneo incubada por 21 dias, a 24 \"C em modo estifico. Em seguida, foi realizada a extracao com metanod, fitirracao para separacao dos micellos e concentraao do solvente, fornecendo 5,3 g de extaro bruto metalico (milho-MeOH).\n\n## Isolamento dos constituintes quimicos\n\nO extrato bruto PDB-AcOEt (2,0 g) foi dissolvido em acetato de etila e, em seguida, particionado com hexano e acetonitrile, resultando em dus solucoes. A solucao ACN, apos concentracao, forneceu a fracao ACN (0,7 g) que foi submetida a cromatografia em coluna usando silica de fase reversa (C-18), eluida com MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O no modo gradiente, resultando em sete sub-fracoes. As sub-fracoes ACN-4 a CN-7 foram reunidas (ACN-4; 400 mg) devido a bioatividade apresentada freate is linaens _Claalosporium cladosporioides e C, yaheraspremen_. Esta sub-fracao ACN-7 foi submetida a una particao com acetato de etila e solucao de hidroxido de sodio 5%. A fase aquosa foi tratada com acido claridro ate pH 5 e, em seguida, extraida com cloroformio que, apos a concentracao do solvente, forneceu a substancia **1** (100 mg). A fase organica (AcOEt), apos concentracao do solvente, foi fractionada em uma coeluna sephadex LH-20 eluida com metanol, resultando em 10 sub-fracoes (FCS 1-10). A sub-fracao FCS-1 (23 mg) foi submetida a CLAE preparativa empregando modo de eluicao isocratico acetonitrila:aqua (38:62), fluxo 20 mL/min, \\(\\lambda\\) 221 nm e columa fenil hexil, resultando no isolamento da substancia **2** (3,5 mg).\n\nO extrato bruto milho-MeOH (5,3 g) foi analisado por RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H, onde constataram-se varios sinais references a hidrogenios metinico s metricos tipcos de acteares. Para remover estes acgata, una porcao do extrato (1) foi dissolvida (parcialmente em accetato de etila, obtendo-se a fracao AcOEt-milho (210 mg). Em seguida, esta fracao foi submetida a cromatografia em coluna com silica de fase reversa C-18 no modo de eluicao isocratico empregando MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (80:20), resultando em M-1 (100 mg). A subfracao M-1 foi purificada por CLAE preparativa utilizando com eluente MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (60:40), fluxo de 15 mL/min, coluna fenil hexil e e 2.221 nm fonecendo 8 sub-fracoes (M1.1 - M1.8). As sub-fracoes (Ceses M1.3, M1.5 % C d1.7 resultam no las submatcino das substancias **3** (8,3 mg), **4** (20,6 mg) e **5** (8,8 mg).\n\nFigure 1: Substáncias produzidas por Xylaria sp.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n### Bioensaio\n\nOs extratos brutos (PDB-AcOEt e milho-MeOH) e as substancias isoladas foram submetidios a tecnica de Bioautografia para deteccao de atividade antifringica. Este bioensaio consiste na nebulizacao de suspenoes dos fungos _Cladosporiur_ elaboroprioides e _Cladosporiur sphaersperum_ (concentracao 5 x 10' esporos/mL em solucao de glucose e sais) em plaacs de CCDC contendo 400 mg dos extracts brutos 100 mg das substancias puras, previamente eluidas com solvente adequado. Em seguida, as placas foram incubadas em camara imida a 25 degC por 48 h. O aparecimento de zonas de inibicao na placa nebulizada com _C. sphaersospermum_ e/ou _C. cladosporioides_ indica a presenca de substancia(s) com potencial antifungico. A nistatina foi a substancia utilizada como antifringico pardao.\n\nAs substancias puras que se mostram potencialmente bioativas foram submetidias a bioensaio, para determinacao do limite de deteccao. Os resultados sao expressos como valores de concentracao da amostra (g/mL) requeridos para produzir um halo de inibicao comparavel com o produzido pelo padrao nistatina. Os ensaios foram realizados em diferentes concentracoes (100, 50, 25, 10, 5 e 1 ug/mL) para as substancias puras e para o padrao.\n\n## Resultados E discussao\n\nO estudo quimico dos extratos brutos PDB-AcOEt e milho-MeOH, produzidos pelo fungo endofittico _Xylaria_ sp., resultou no isolamento do acido 2-hexilicdeno-3-metlibutandioico (**1**), citocalasina (**2**), 7-decolorigrosfolvina (**3**), citocalasina B (**4**) e grisefoculina (**5**). A identificacao destas substancias foi realizada com base na comparaao de seus dados especroscopicos (RMN 1H e 10C, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC e EM) com valores disponi-veis an literatura. Os metabolitos **1-5** ja havium sido produzidos por fungos da familia Xylariaceae, entretanto, este e o primeiro relato da producao de **3**, **4** e **5** por um fungo endofittico.\n\nA analise detalhada dos espectros de massas, RMN de 1H e 10C (uni e bidimensionais), alem da comparaao com dados da literatura', permitu a identificacao de **1** como acido 2-hexilicdeno-3-metlibutandioico.\n\nA substancia **2** foi identificada como citocalasina D (C3H2,N0O) atrav es da analise dos dados de RMN de 1H e 10C e EM-ES (+120 V) e evidenciou 13 graus de insaturacao. A analise dos dados de RMN de 1H e 10C indicou a presencia de tras carbonilas, um anel benzenico monossubstituido e seis carbonos olefinicos, o que resultou no grau de insaturacao 10. Os 3 graus de insaturacoes renamces esteyerima que a mollecula fosse constituida por 3 anes, alem do and aromatico. O espectro de hidrogenio apresentou sias em d1 3,57 e 5,26 caracteristicos de hidrogenios carbonilicos, que foram atribuidos a H-7 e H-21. A geometrica das ligacoes duraplas \\(\\Delta^{13,14}\\) e \\(\\Delta^{19,20}\\) foi determinada como \\(E\\), devido as constantes de acoplamento (_J_ = 15,0 Hz) entre os hidrogenios. Os sinusa \\(\\delta_{1}\\), 1,38, 1.05, 0.39 e 2,27 formatividos as meltilas H,C-23, H,C-22, H,C-11 1.6,C-25, respectivamente. O sinal referente a una metila em 8h, 2,27 f e tipico de citocalasina com um grupo acetano a forma de radical. Estas informacoes aliadas a analise dos dados espectrometricos de RMN de 1H, 10C, gHMQC, gHMBC, gCOSY, EM e comparaao com os dados diz literatura' confirmaram a substancia **2** como sendo una citocalasina do tipo D. A configuracao relativa de 2 foi determinada por comparaao dos valores de losclamcenos quimicos de RMN 1H e 10C, constantes de acoplamento e comparaao com os dados de literatura. Experimento de rotacao ottica forreceu [a],25 +15,4 (c, 0.25 EtOH), condizente com a litetraura', permituido identificada-la como (+)-citocalasina D. Os valores dos deslocamentos quimicos da citocalasina D (**2**) estao aperentados na Tabela 1.\n\nA substancia **4** foi identificada como citocalasina B atrav es da analise dos dados espectrometricos de RMN de 1H e 10C (uni e bidimensionais), EM-ES (+120 V) e comparacao com dados da literatura',01,01. Os sinais registrados pelo espectro de RMN de 1H em 8h, 5,81, 5,03, 6,76 e 5,70 foram atribuidos aos hidrogenios das ligacoes dupla \\(\\Delta^{13,14}\\) e \\(\\Delta^{12,25}\\), respectivamente. Ambas ligacoes duraples possume geometria \\(E_{\\mu}\\) una vez que a constante de acoplamento entre os hidrogenios H-13-H-14 e H-21-H-22 e de 15,5 Hz. Pelo espectro de RMN de 1H tambem foi possivel verificar a presencia de 2 metilas (CH3-11 e CH3-24) e de hidrogenios carbonilicos (\\(\\delta_{\\text{H}}\\) 3,61 e 4,36) atribuidos aos hidrogenios H-7 e H-20. Os dados espectrometricos de **4** foram comparados com os da citocalasina D (**2**), onde rot jossvelt noar una grande semethelnacos nos sinais e constatou-se que **4** se travata de uma submastica da classe de citocalasinas. A diferenca marcante entre **2** e **4** est na a usancia de um sinal entre \\(\\delta_{\\text{H}}\\) 2,10-2,30, atribuido o deslocamento quimico da metila do acetato, o que permitiu propo que a ligacao com o C-9 cocorre com o oxigenio do grupo acetato, em vez de se ligar no atomo de carbono como no caso da citocalasina D (**2**). A configuracao relativa de **4** foi determinada por comparaao dos valores de **Table 1**.: Dados de RMN de 1H* (500 MHz) e 13C (125 MHz) da citocalasina D (**2**) e citocalasina B (**4**) em DMSO-d-p, \\(\\delta\\) (ppm)\n\n## Page 4\n\ndeslocamentos quimicos em RMN de 1H, 13C, constantes de acoplamentnos e comparacao com dados da literatura3.

The phytochemical investigation of the flowers of _Pterogyne nitens_ (Caasalpinioideae) resulted in the isolation and identification of nine phenolic derivatives, quercetin 3-_O_-sophrooside, taxifolin, astilbin, ourateacetechin, caffeic, ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic and gallic acid, besides two guanidine alkaloids, pterogynine, pterogynidine. This is the first time these compounds have been reported in _P. nitens_ flowers. As this is a monospecific genus, these secondary metabolites may have taxonomical significance. Their structures were assigned on the basis of spectroscopic analyses, including two-dimensional NMR techniques.\n\nPterogyne nitens; flavonoids; guanidine alkaloids.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n_Pterogyne nitens_ Tulasse (Fabaceae - Caesalpinioideae), uma especie pertencente a un género monoespecifico, e popularmente cohecida como \"amendoin-do-campo\", \"amendoin-bravo\", \"ballsamo\", \"vyi-raro\", \"cocal\", \"tipa\" etc. Na America Latina essa especie arborea ocorre na Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguai e Brasil. No territorio brasileiro ocorre com freqiencia na regiao de Mata Atlantica e Cerrado comprerendida entre o Ceara tao Paran.1\n\nFootnote 1: Email: bozani@iq.unesp.br\n\n\"Amendoin-bravo\", como e popularmente conhecida no estado de Sao Paulo, e camplamente empregada na construcao civil de sas características da sua madeira moderadamente densa e resistente.2 _P. nitens_ também echocida pela belez a odor de suas fllores, bem como pela intensidade de suas follagens e frutificacao possui grande valor ornamental sendo, portanto, recomendada para arborizacao de vias urbanas e rodovies e na reposicao de mata cilier em locais com inundacoes periodicas. Esta especie habita os remanescentes de vegetacao paulista e encontra-se sob risco de extincao, fazendo parte da lista de especies recomendadas para a conservacao genetica no estado de Sao Paulo.3\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nFootnote\n\n## Page 2\n\nligacao do grupo metoxlico ao anel arornatico foi estabelecida pela correlacao observada entre os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,90 (OCH\\({}_{\\rm J}\\)) e 147.9 (C-3), no mapa de conformos _g_HMBC. Assim, a substancia **2** pode ser caracterizada como sendo acido ferdlico.7 Os espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H da substancia **3** apresentaram dois singlets \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,98 (2H) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,80 (6H), os quais foram atribuidos aos hidrogenios metricnics H-2 e H-6 e aos dois grupos metoxlicos, respectivamente. Os demais dahod espectrasimaram a posicao dos dois grupos metoxlicos nos carbonos C-3 e C-5 e permitam identificar a es-trutum alocular de **3** como sendo acido sinapico.8 Os dados dos espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C de **4** foram quasiez simalers aqueles observados para o acido cafeico **1**. Na estrutura de **4**, alem dos sinais de uma unidade de acido cafeico analisados a partir dos espectros de RMN de \\({}^{15}\\)C, foram diagnostics um conjunto de sinais compuiras e com una uladde de acido quintico. O espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H angerencus anisas teris hidrogenios metricnos em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,56 (dd, \\(J\\) = 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-4), 3,92 (d, \\(J\\) = 3,5 Hz, H-4) e 5,06 (td, \\(J\\) = 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-5) e para hidrogenios metilenicos na regiao compreendida entre \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 1,08 e 1,99 (H-2 e H-6), os quais confirmaram a presenca de una unidade derivada do acido quintico. A ligacao do grupo cafeofila a unidade de acido quintico foi estabelecida pela correlacao observada entre os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,06 (H-5) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 165,7 (C-9'), no mapa de conformos gHMBC. Os valores observados para os acoplamentos de H-4 com H-3 e H-5 indicaram una relacao axial-equatorial entre H-4 e H-3 (_J_ = 3,5 Hz) e axial-entre H-4 e H-5 (_J_ = 10,0 Hz) confirmando as posicoes diequatoriais para os grupos cafeofila e a hidroxila (4-OH). Os experimentos de NOSSY 1D mostraram um aumento na intensidade do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,92 (H-3) pela irradiacao do sinal atribuido ao hidrogenio H4(3,56) e ausencia de NOE quando da irradiacao do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,06 (H-5), consolidando a configuracao relativa proposta. Tais informacoes foram confirmadas com dados da literatura, indicando que a estrutura de **4** corresponde ao acido 5_-O-_cafeoilquintico.9 Os dados obtidos dos espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C permitiram caracterizar a substancia **5** como sendo acido galleo.10\n\nOs espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C permitiram inferir que a substancia **6** pertenee a classe dos flavonoides. Entre outras feicoes destacam-se o conjunto de sinais do espectro de \\({}^{15}\\)C em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 73,6,85,0 e 198,3 atribuidos aos carbonos C-3, C-2 e C-4, respectivamente, indicando que **6** possui a estrutura de um diidroflavanol. Um par de dubletos em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,91 (_J_ = 2,0 Hz, 1H) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,88 (_J_ = 2,Hz, 1H) foram atribuidos ao enel A 5,7,9,10-tetrassubstitution. Os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,96 (d, \\(J\\) = 2,0 Hz, 1H), \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,80 (d, \\(J\\) = 8,0 Hz, 1H) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,84 (dd, \\(J\\) = 2,0 e 8,0 Hz, 1H) corroboram o padrao 1,3,4-trissubtitude para o anel B. Ainda o espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H de **6** apresento um par de dubletos em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,90 (_J_ = 12,0 Hz, 1H) e 4,49 (_J_ = 12,0 Hz, 1H), os quais foram atribuidos aos hidrogenios H-2 e H-3, respectivamente. A constante de acoplamento apresentada por estes dois dubletos (_J_ = 12 Hz) sugere um acoplamento do tipo axial-axial, conduzindo a proposico de que o anel B e o grupo hidroxila 3-OH matem una relacao _anii_. Estes dados analisados em consomnancia com os de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)C permitiram caracterizar **6** como sendo taxifolina.11 Os espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C de **7** indicaram uma estreita similaridade entre **6** **6** **7**. A unica diferenca notada entre os espectros das daus substancias refere-se aos sinais característicos de uma unidade glicosifica en **7**. O sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 17,8, atribudo no acarbono mello C-6\" e o conjunto de sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 100,1 (C-1\"), 71,7 (C-4\"), 70,4 (C-3\"), 70,1 (C-2\") e 69,0 (C-5\") permitiram caracterizar a unidade monosficia como sendo una ramnose. O espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H demosstro a presencia de um dubleto em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,04 que foi atribudo ao hidrogenio amorrico H-1\", cuja constante de acoplamento de 1,5 Hz inferior a configuracao \\(\\alpha\\) para a unidade de ramnose. A correlacao deste dubleto e o sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 75,7 atribuido ao carbono C-3, observada no mapa de conformos gHMBC, sugeriu que a unidade de ramnose se encontra ligada ao carbono C-3. Os dados espectros-cos analisados para **7** indicaram tratar-se da estrutura da asti1bina.12 A analise polarimetrica dos diidroflavonosis **6** e 7 indicou valores de rotacao optica especifica de \\(+17^{\\circ}\\) (c= 1,02 MeOH, 27 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C) e-22\\({}^{\\circ}\\)(c= 0,82, MeOH, 27 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C), respectivamente. Esses dados sugerem as configuracoes absolus \\(R_{\\rm c}\\) dos carbons C-2 e C-3 presentes nas extruturas moleculares de **6** e 7, os quais es mostarram compufeis com os valores descrito na literatura.13\n\nO espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H da substancia **8** apresentou tres si-nais característicos de hidrogenios aromaticos: \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,53 (s, 2H), 5,93 (d, \\(J\\) = 2,0 Hz, 1H) e 5,95 (d, \\(J\\) = 2,0 Hz, 1H) indicando tratar-se tambem de una flavonoide. Os sinais correspondentes de dos sidinos principales em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,72 (dd, \\(J\\) = 3,0 e 17,0 Hz) e 2,86, \\(J\\) = 5,0 e 17,0 Hz) foram atribuidos aos hidrogenios H-4 e H-4b, respectivamente e permitam atribuidos a entrure de uma catequina para **8**. Os sinais relativos aos carbonos entre \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 100,1 e 157,9 e 29,1 analisados em conjuncao com as correlacoes observadas no mapa de conformos gCOSY para os hidrogenios H-4a, H-4b e H-3 apidaram a confirmar a proximacao de uma catequina para **8**. Os experimentos de NOSSY 1D foram emprogrados visando confirmar a esterequoimica relativa de C-2 e C-3. A irradiacao en \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,73 (H-4a) causou aumento na intensidade do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (m, H-3). A irradiacao do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,86 (H-4b) tambem levoa aumento de intensidade em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (H-3), indicando a proximidade destes hidrogenios. No entanto, pela intensidade dos NOE observados os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,86 (H-4b) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (H-3) estao posicionados na mesma face dho qano ed ano quala ligandos. A irradiacao do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,73 (H-4a) tambem causou um incremento \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,78 (sl, H-2), indicando una correlacao 1,3-diaxial entre H-4a e H-2. Ao irradiar-se o sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (H-3), houve am ganho de intensidade em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,78 (H-2) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,73 (H-4a) ccerente com una relacao _sin_ entre H-2, H-3 e H-4a. Estes dados analisados em consomnancia com as constantes de acoplamento destenis semis permitram atribur a configuracao relativa proposta. O mapa de conformos gHMBC demonstro como una intens correlacao entre o siennal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,80 (s, 3H), atribudo a um hidrogenio metoxlico e o sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 136,0, o qual esta relacionado ao carbono C-4', sugerindo que o grupo metoxila se encontra ligado ao carbono C-4'. A medida da rota-cao optica especifica de **8** [\\(\\alpha_{\\rm h}\\)]\\({}_{\\rm D}\\)= -58\\({}^{\\circ}\\)(c= 1,22, acetona) indicou as \n\n## Page 3\n\nconfiguracoes \\(R\\) e \\(R\\) dos carbonos C-2 e C-3, similares aos valores concentrados para a epigalocatequina.14 Os dados apresentados sao compativels com estrutura da ourateacacatequina,15 confirmando sua identifadec com **8**.\n\nA analise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracterizar a substancia **9** tambem como um flavononide. O espectro de RMN de 13C apresento os sinais em 8C 177.3, 155, 4 e 132,9 atribuidos aos carboneos-C-4, C-2 e C-3, respectivamente, evidencian-d do a subclasse dos flavonois. Os sinais em 8,144, 7 e 148,7 atribuidos as carboneos C-3' e C-4', respectivamente, evidenciam um flavonol cubo anel B encontra-se 1',3',4'-trissubstituido. Adicioanmente, os sinais de RMN de 13C comprentidos entre 8C 60,6 e 8C 82,6 analisados com os sinais de RMN de 1H em 8,566 (d, \\(J\\) = 7,5 Hz, 1H) e 8H 4,58 (d, \\(J\\) = 7,5 Hz, 1H) correspondentes a dois hidrogenios anomericos indicam dus subunidades de glucose c, com base no valor da constante de acoplamento (_J_ = 7,5 Hz) para estes dois dublets, verificou-se tratar de dues subunidades de b-glicose. Os experimentos de _g_HMBC demostrarami dus correlacces entre os dubletos em 8,56,6 e 8,4,58 atribuidos nos hidrogenios anomericos H-1\" e H-1\", respectivamente, e o sinal em 8H 82,6 sugerindo que a ligacao interglicosficia seja do tipo 2\"-1\". O mapa de contornos gHMBC de **9** tambem apresentou uma correlacao entre o sinal em 8,132,9 atribuido ac carbono C-3 e o dubleto em 8,56, fevando a conclusao que a posisao de _O_-glicosilacao se encontra em C-3. Pelos dados obtidos pode-se caracterizar **9** como sendo quercetin 3-_O_-sorofoso.16\n\nAnalise dos dados de RMN de 13C das substancia **10 e 11** indi- cou tratar-se de alcaloides de estruturas bastante similares. Entre outras caracterisas destacam-se a presencia de sinais em torno de 8,155, 7, e 156,7 (C-2) tipo de carbon guanidino e um corojunto de cinco sinais relacionados ase subunidades isoprotcilas em toro de 8,17,8/17,7; 8, 25,225,1; 8, 39,0/38,7; 8, 119,2/119,0 e 8,135,8/136,0. A analise desdes dados indicou que **10 e 11** contem um nucleo guanidinico substitudo por unidades hemiterpenodicas. Dado evidenciado por dos singlets em 8,12,62 (H-4') e d\\({}_{\\text{th}}\\) 1,68 (H-5') atributados nos hidrogenios dos grupos mettilicos; um dubleto em 8,372 (d, \\(J\\) = 6,5, H-1') e um tripole em 8,16(t, \\(J\\) = 6,5, H-2') relacionados ase hidrogenios metilenos e metilinco, respectivamente, para **10**. Da mesma forma, dados similares caracterizaram a estrutura de **11**, indicando que as estruturas em questao se tratam de alcaloides guanidino-prenilados. A unica diferenca entre os alcaloides **10 e 11** deve-se ao padrao de substituicao do nucleo guanidrinco. No alcalo **10** o anali 8,372 (_J_ = 6,5 Hz), atribuidos hidrogenios H-1', apresenta-se como um dubleto devido acoplamento com H-2'. Adiciammente, a anusencia de hidrogenio azorncito no asstrutura calodizica indicou o padrao \\(N\\),_N_-substituido para **10**, que foi caracterizado como sendo a pterognina.17 No alcaloidle **11**, a presenca de um tripleto em 8,7,72 (t, \\(J\\) = 6,5, 1H) devido a acoplamento do hidrogenio azorncito do nucleo guanidinico com H-1' da unidade hemiterpenicnica indicou que a substituica terpenica ocor nos nitrogenios vicinala da estrutura guanidinica. Analise de todos os dados indica que **11** possul padrao \\(N\\),_N_' de substituicao isoprotcilica. Fundamentado nestas analises, a substancia **11** foi caracterizada com a pterognilina,3 um isomero constituicol do alcaloide **10**.\n\nAs substancias **1-11** foram avaliadas quanto a sua capacidade de inibica sobre mieleporoxidase (MPO), uma heme-enzima abundante em polimorfonucleares (PMNs), e considerada uma macromolcule-chave na resposta immunologica inspecifica a varios agentes invasors, principalmente bacterias. A MPO e responsavel pela converso de pervida de hidrogenio (H,O) e anions clorte em agua e acido hipocloroso (HOCl) que, por sua vez, atua como um potente agente antimicrobiano. Alem disso, o excesso da atribuidade de MPO e subequiente producao exagerada de HOCl culmina em un intenso estresse oxidativo para os PMNs. A literatura correlaciona essa injuria oxidativa promovida por MPO e HOCl com inameros processos inflamatorios, tais como artritite reumuatodide, fibrose csticia, doenca inflamatoria intestinal (IBD), injuria pulmonar neonatal, etc. Dessa forma, a busca por inibidores de MPO a partir de fontes naturais forma-se de grande valia na descoberta de novos agentes anti-inflamidators.18\n\nDentre as substancias ensaadas com MPO, apenas as substancias **5**e **9** prostarram-se ativas, exibindo CI30 de 17,5 e 3,72 nM, quando comparadas a queretcetina, utilizada como controle positivos, que apresentou uma CI30 de 1,22 nM. O valor de CI30 da quercetina apresenta-se inferior aquele observado para o seu glicosde **9**, sugerindo a importancia de uma hidroxila livre na posicao 3 para atividade de inibica o MPO. As demais substancias maxima-se inativas (CI30 > 100 nM), including a substancia **6**, um analog hidrogenado da quetercina. Essa observacao supere que uma insaturacao situada entre os carbonso C-2 e C-3 no nucleo flavonolcio para uma acao inibitoria sobre MPO.\n\nOs extratos e fracoes obtidas das flores de _P. nitens_ tiveram sua capacidade antioxidante avaliada no ensaio em cromatoplacas reveladas com b-carotene, mostrando-se attivos, uma vez que mantiveram a coloracao laranja nos pontos de alpicacao. As substancias fenolicas isoladas este estudo sao provavelmente as responsaveis pela attivadade antioxidante desas fracoes detectadas pelo teste preliminar com b-carotene e que foi anteriormente relatado por Cai e colaboradores, que demonstraram a capacidade sequestradora de radicais livres das substancias **1-9** nos ensaios com DPPH (2,2-direni-1-picrilidrazila) e ABTS [2,2'-azino-di-(3-etillesponica-6-acidto sulfonico)].19 Atividade sequestradora de radicais exibida pelos derivados fenicos ven sendo amplamente discutida a la literatura e esta correlacionada a fatev mesomicros que conferemente a esse grupo funcional una alta reutividade com doadores de eletrons.20 Os alcaloides guanidinicos **10 e 11** tivera seu poder antioxidante avaliado sobre os radicais DPPH c ABTS. Os resultados indicaram que os alcaloides sao involveso de compPH (CI30 > 200 nM) e mostram atividade bia sobre o radical ABTS, apresentando CI30 de 87,7 e 190,0 mM, tendo a quercetina como controle positivos (CI30 de 7,64 e 3,12 mM para os radicais DPPH e ABTS, respectivamente).\n\nO estudo quimico das flores de _P. nitens_ culminou no isolamento de onze substancias de tras classes quimicas distintas: flavonoides (flavonois, diidroflavonois e catequinas), derivados do acidio e alcaloides. Dentre esses, somente as substancias **10** e 11 ja havim sido relatadas como preterentes ao melaboloma de _P. nitens_. Este trabalb permitiu concluir anda que os metabolitos secundarios acumolados nas flores desta especiac sao predominantemente de naturza fenolica. A descricao dos constituitunes acumulados em _P. nitens_ e tambem de grande valia tendo em conta que sua madeira verm sendo empregada indiscriminadamente pela construcao civil e, por tratar-se de um genor monoespecifico, esta leguminosa esta seriamente ameacada de extincao.2\n\n## Parte Experimental\n\n### Procellentos esperimentais gerais\n\nOs espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectromero Varian INOVA-500e operando a 500 MHz para o nucleo de 13C, TMS foi utilizado como referencia interna. Os dados de rotacao optica foram obtidos em polarimento Polamar A Carl Zeiss Jena. As analises por CLAE no modo analitico foram realizadas em equi\n\n## Page 4\n\npamento ProStar/Varian(r) acoplado ao detector ProStar 330(r) de arranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analitica Phenomenex(r) Fenil-Hexila (250 x 4,600 mm; 5 mm). No modo preparativo, as analisies por CLAE foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar/Varian(r) acoplado ao detector ProStar-UV(r), utilizando-se coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexila (250 x 21,2 mm; 10 mm). Nas separacoes em coluna aberta foram utilizadas gel de silica derividade C-18 (40-63 mm, Merck(r)), gel de silica para comatomagrafia _flash_ (35-70 mm) e para comatomagrafia de excluso molecular (Sephadex,(r) LHI-200). As analisies por camatomagrafia em camada delgada foram realizadas com rotamoplacas de gel de silica G60 (0,25 mm). Apos o desenvolvimento das comatomelacas estas foram visualizadas sob luz ultravioleta (l = 254 e 365 nm) e reveladas com solucao de anisaldedo em acido sulfurico seguido de aquecimento.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nAs flores de _P. nitens_ foram coletadas no Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo - SP, no mes de abril de 2003, pela Dra. M. C. M. Young. O material botanico foi identificado como sendo _Pterogyne nitens_ (Fabaceae - Caesalpinoideae) pela Dra. I. Cordeiro, do mesmo Instituto. Uma exsicata (SP204319) encontra-se depositada no herbario \"Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann\" do Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo - SP.\n\n## Extracao e isolamento\n\nAs flores (1,8 kg) foam secas a temperatura ambiente por 15 dias e, posteriormente, submetidas a moagent empregano moiho de facas. O po obido (1,5 kg) foi weado a macrogazo empregano hexanos e posteriormen maceração em etanol. Apos evaporacao, o extrata hexanico (3,8 g) foi analisado por RMN de 'H e CCDC mostrando tratar-se de uma mistura complexa de terpenos. O extrata etanolico (15,0 g) foi dissolvido em uma mistura de metanol:agua (7:3) e posteriormente submetido a particao liquido-liquido empreganado aceto de etile a _n_-butanol.\n\nA fracao AcOE (3,8 g) foi submetida a comatomagrafia em coluna de permeacao em gel (Sephadex,(r) LHI-20, 180 x 5 cm), eluida em MeOH, obtendo-se 25 subfracoes de 75 mL. A subfracao AcOE-17 (143,0 mg) foi submetida a comatomagrafia _flash_ em coluna de gel de silica (28 x 3 cm), eluida em modo gradiente (CHCl;MeOH, 100 a 50%), obtendo-se os acidos cafeico (**1**; 12, 0 mg), ferulico (**2**; 14,0 mg) e sanpico (**3**, 7,0 mg). A subfracao AcOE-20 (79 mg) foi submetida a comatomagrafia em coluna de fase reversa (8 x 3 cm) empregano mistura de MeOH:H\\({}_{\\text{O}}\\) (30 a 80%), resultando no isolamento de dois flavonoides, taxifina (6, 14 mg) e outaectaequana (**8**, 15 mg).\n\nA fracao _n_-butanolica (3,0 g) foi submetida a cromatografia por exclusao molecular (LHI-20, Sephadex, 180 x 5 cm) eluida em MeOH, resultando em 22 subfracoes de 70 mL. A subfracao BuOH-7 (280 mg) foi submetida a cromatografia em coluna de gel de sslica (28 x 4 cm), eluida em mistura de CHCl;MeOH (10 a 30%), obtendo-se dos alcaloides guanidinicos, pterognizino (**10**, 98 mg) e (96 mg). A subfracao BuOH-12 (120 mg) foi submetida a cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (10 x 3 cm), eluida em MeOH:H\\({}_{\\text{O}}\\) (1:1), obtendo-se astighina (**7**, 27 mg). A subfracao BuOH-18 (97 mg) foi submetida a CLAE-UV preparativo [MeOH:H\\({}_{\\text{O}}\\) (56:44), l = 254 nm, fluxo = 11.0 mL/min), culminando no isolamento do flavonol glicosilado (9, 18 mg).\n\nA fracao hidradocolica (1,7 g) foi inicialmente submetida a cromatografia de permeacao em gel (Sephadex,(r) LHI-20, 120 x 8 cm), eluida em MeOH, obtendo-se 13 subfracoes de 35 mL. A subfracao HA-5 foi identificada como acido galico (**5**, 11 mg) e a subfracao HA-12, como sendo o acido 5-O-cafeiolquinco (**4**, 22 mg).\n\n## Atividades antioxidante e inibitoria sobre molecoroxidase (MPO)\n\nPara os ensaios em CCD reveladas com b-caroteno, as amostras foram eluidas e reveladas com uma solucao dicloromentaica de b-carotene a 0,02%.

The fractionation of methanol extract of _T. claussenii_ seeds bioassay-guided against _Spodoptera frugiperda_ has led to the identification of the o-phenylalkyl and alkenyl fatty acids as active compounds in this extract. The structures of the compounds were proposed by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data.\n\nKeywords: _Trichilia claussenii_; o-phenylalkyl and alkenyl fatty acids; _Spodoptera frugiperda._\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nO milho representa um dos principais cereais em todo mundo e cultivado em pequenas, medias e grandes propriedades. No Brasil e considerada como cultura de expresso nacional, de grande importancia social e economica, e esta presente de norte a sul do Pais.' Sao utilizados, durante o desenvolvimento da cultura, insumos sinteticulos como pesticides qua, allem deumenta os custos de producao, polucn a ambiente e de eikaxim resfudos nos alimentos. O controle de pragas e uma das atividades de importancia economica que deve ser ben planejada para a obtenao de maiores rendimentos economicos.2 A lagarta-do-cartucho, _Spodoptera frugiperda_ (J. E. Smith), destaca-se como importante praga do milho, tanto pela reducao da productvideo de da qualidade do produco final, quanto pela eliducidade de controle.23\n\nFootnote 2: e-mail: paulo@dq.ufscar.br\n\nUm dos primeiros relatos da atividade insecticida de _Trichilia_ spp. sobre S. _frugiperda_ foi foi foi foi foi foi foi foi foi foi foi.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nforam concentradas por destilacao do solvente em evaporator rotation, formecendo os extratos hexanico, metanolico e hidrometanolico, respectivamente. Os extratos foram submetiods a ensaios de toxicidade sobre a lagarta-do-carutcho do milho, _S. frugiperda_, e os que apresentaram attividade foram fractionados.\n\n### Ensaio de toxicidade\n\nOs ensaios biologicos sobre _S. frugiperda_ foram realizados no Laboratorio de Bioensaios do Departamento de Quimica da UFSCar, a 25 + 1 degC, UR de 70 +- 5% e fotofase de 12 h. Para realizacao dos testes, a criacao de _S. frugiperda_ (J. E. Smith) foi mandita em laboratorio, sendo as lagarta alimentadas com dieta artificial e os adultos com solucao de mel a 10%.11\n\nOs ensaios de toxicidade basearam-se a metodologia descrita por Paula _et al._._12 Para realizacao dos biensaios, foram preparadas solucoes das amastros em acetona e/ou agua. Foram utilizadas grupos de 10 larvas de _S. frugiperda_ no segundo instar (5 dias), onde cada grupo foi transferida para placas de Petri. As medias dos pessos dos grupos de insetos form obtidas pelas medidas realizadas em balanca analitica. Em cada inseto, 1 \\(\\mu\\)L da solucao em acetona ou agua foi alpicado topicamente, via uma microseringa. Para evitar a possivel more do inseto, em cada grupo de larvas foi colocada pequena porcao (300,0 mg) da dieta artificial. Este processo foi realizado 1 h apos a aplicacao da solucao. O controle consistir na anplicacao de 1 \\(\\mu\\)L de acetona ou agua em cada inseto e foi realizado utilizando as mesas condicoes descritas anteriormente. Todos os experimentos e orespectivo controle foram realizados em triplicata. Todos os ensaios foram realizados na concentracao de 10 mg/mL e a mortalidade dos insectos foi verificada apos 48 h. Os resultados foram expressos em media da porcentagem da mortalidade e analisados utilizando-se a analise de variancia (ANOVA), sendo usado P <= 0,05 como nivel de significancia.\n\n### Isolamento e identificacao dos constituintes quimicos de _T. claussenii_\n\nO extrato metamolico das sementes de _T. claussenii_ (TCSM, 4,54 g) foi suspenso em una mistura MeOH/H,O (7:3) e particio-naato successivamente com hexano, CH2Cl2, ACoEt e MoOH/H,O, obtendo-se apos a evaporacao dos solventes as fracoes: TCSM1 = 0,37 g ; TCSM2 = 0,06 g; TCSM3 = 1,00 g e TCSM4 = 3,10 g, respectivamente. As fracoes obtidas foram submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade sobre _S. frugiperda_. A fracao bioativa TCSM1 (0,37 g) foi fraciocanda em columa de gel delica (70-230 mesh) entrappedo-se como eleunes: hexano 100%, hexano/ACoEt (99:1/98:2/95:5/9:1/8:2/7:3/1:1), ACoEt 100%, ACoE/MeOH (99:1/98:2/95:5/9:1/8:2/7:3/1:1) e MeOH 100%; as fracoes obtidas foram tenuialos em 6 fracoes (TCSM1-1 a TCSM1-6) com base as enelmnelaane revelada pela analise por cromatografia em camada fina e, posteriormente, submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade. As sub-fracoes bioativas TCSM1-3 (0,05 g) e TCSM1-4 (0,20 g) foram fractionadas em gel de silica (70-230 mesh), utilizando como eleuten hexano/ACoEt/MeOH (hexano/ACoEt (8:2/7:3/1:1), ACoE 100%, ACoE/MeOH (99:1/8:2/95:5/9:1/8:2/7:3/1:1) e MeOH 100%) em gradiente de polarado crescente. Atraves das similaridades cromatograficas as fracoes form reuniadas e submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade. As sub-fracoes biotivas TCSM1-3-2 (0,006 g) e TCSM1-4-4 (0,01 g) foram identificadas com mistura dos acidos o-fenil alcanoicos e alquenocios atraves da analise dos espectros de RMN de \\({}^{\\text{i}}\\)H e por comparacao com os dados da literatura. Para identificacao do mannho das cadeias metilicanos dos acidos, uma pequena aliquota das amastros toi esterificala com diazomethane como desorte por Leonard _et al._,37: fonrecendo os esteres metflicos identificados via CG/EM e por comparacao com a literatura.\n\n## Resultados e discussion\n\nInicialmente, os extratos organicos das cascas dos frutos (TCCF, pericarpo), cascas das sementes (TCCS, arilo) e sementes (TCS) de _T. claussenii_ foram submetids a ensaios de toxicidade sobre _S. frugiperda_. Os resultados iniciais mostraram que o extrato metamolico das sementes de _T. claussenii_ (TCSM) provocou a mais alta porcentagem de mortalidade (64,0%, Figura 1).\n\nO extrato TCSM foi entao fracionado, formecendo as fracoes hexanco (TCSM-1), diclormetano (TCSM-2), acetato de etila (TCSM-3) e hidrometanolico (TCSM-4). Entretanto, somente a fracao TCSM-1 apresentou attividade relevante com 70,0% de mortalidade sobre a lagarta-do-carutcho (Tabela 1).\n\nO extrusion of the \\(\\mu\\)L,\n\n## Page 3\n\npresentes nestas fracoes esterres mettlicos e/ou estreres graxo. Esses dados para os acidos o-fenil aclanocios e alquenciocos sao equivalentes aos relatados anteriormente.8,14\n\nPara identificacao dos constituintes minoritarios (acidos graxos), do tamanno das cadeias metilencias dos acidos o-fenil alcanocios e alquenciocos e localizacao da posiciao da ligacao dupla dos dilitmos, uma pequena aliquota das fracoes TCSM-1-4-4 e TCSM-1-3-2 foi esterificadda com diazometano10,e posteriormente, analisada via CG-EM. Atraves da comparacao dos espectros de massas com os adados da bibiotica do CG-EM de a literatura,8,14 foi possibel propor o stammos das cadeias meteilencias desses acidos que variamente no 10 a 15 carbons (Figura 2, Tabela 2). Foi possibel propor tambem a localizacao da ligacao dupla dos acidos o-fenil alquenciocos entre os carbonos 8-e em relacao ao grupo fenila. Os acidos o-fenil alquenciocos apresentaram como pico base _m/z_ 104, oriundo da fragmentacao do tipo McLafferty da ligacao dupla (Esquema 1). O cormatograma da fracao bioativa TCSM-1-4-4 apresentan 39 picos, cujos espectros de massas from comparados aos de bibiotica de dados do CG-EM e literatura,8,14 extendando na identificacao de 18 acidos que correspondem a 88,9% da porcentagem relativa dos mesmos na fracao, sendo 74,8% acidos o-fenil alcanocios e alquenciocos e 14,1% acidos graxos (Tabela 2).\n\nA ocorrencia dos acidos o-fenil alcanocios e alquenciocos ja foi relatada anteriormente em folhas de _T. claussenii_,8 porem ainda nao havia relatos da associacao dos mesmos com atividade insecticidea encontrada nesta especie.\n\nFootnote 8: endnote:\n\n## Page 4\n\n* [3] Waquil, J.

The present investigation reveals that _P. nitens_ extracts and fractions were more effective against _C. brucei_ and _C. parapsilosis_ than against _C. neoformans_. The growth of _C. albicans_ was moderately affected by all tested extracts and fractions. The strongest effects were observed for _n_-butanol fractions from branches (MIC = 15.6 mg/mL) and roots (MIC = 31.2 mg/mL) against _C. brucei_. Additionally, the chromatographic fractionation of the _n_-butanol fraction from branches afforded four guanidine alkaloids; _N-1.N.-2.N.3_-trisopentenylguanidine (**1**), described for the first time in the Fabaceae family, and nitensidines **A-C (2-4)**, which showed moderate activity towards _C. brucei_ (MIC = 62.5 mg/mL) and _C. parapsilosis_ (MIC = 31.2 mg/mL).\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe clinical relevance of opportunistic fungal infections have increased at an alarming rate in the second half of the twentyth century, including individuals infected with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer (Clark & Hajeh, 2002; Hage et al., 2002). The most frequent causing agents of such infections are _Candida, Aspergillus_ species, _Cryptococcus neoformans_, _Mucor_ and some unusual genera such as _Fusarium, Trichosporon,\n\n## Page 2\n\nand _Seedosporium_(Guarro et al., 2006; Nucci & Anaissie, 2007). Furthermore, the most common treatment for these infectious diseases involves azoles and polyene macrolides, which are limited in their spectrum, and presenting severe side effects (Helmerhorst et al., 1999). For this reason, there is a need for new antifungal compounds which can serve as lead compounds for further development in antifungal chemotherapy. In this way, plants have been proven to be a rich source of antimicrobial agents (Vieira et al., 2005, Alves et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2006; Sena Filho et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007; Batista-Junior et al., 2008; Cardoso-Lopes et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2008; Tempone et al., 2008; Bertucci et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2009a; Silva-Junior et al., 2009).\n\n_Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, is popularly named in South America as \"tipa\", \"vyi-raro\", \"cocal\", \"amendoinzeiro\", \"balsamo\" and \"amendoin-bravo\" according to the region where this plant grows. It is a sole beautiful legume tree from _Pterogyne_ genus, which is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, reaching 5-12 m height (Burkart, 1952; Lorenzi, 1998). Cold aqueous preparations using stem barks has been used as folk medicine for treating of ascaridiasis (Crivos, 2007). Previous chemical and biological studies have demonstrated the presence of guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity against to human cancer cell lines (Bolzani et al., 1995; Ferreira et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2007, 2009b,c) and phenolics with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging activities (Fernandes et al., 2008; Regasini et al., 2008a,b,c; Souza et al., 2009; Souza et al., 2010).\n\nThus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of extracts and fractions from branches, green fruits, roots and stem barks and isolated terpene guanidine alkaloids from _P. nitens_ against four opportunistic human yeasts (_Candida albicans, C. Brusei, C. parapsilosis_ and _Cryptococcus neoformans_), by using broth microdilution test.\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n### Plant material\n\nRoots, branches, green fruits and stem barks of _Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo (Sao Paulo, Brazil) by Ph.D. Maria C. M. Young in January 2005 and identified by Ph.D. Ines Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP 204319b) was deposited at the State Herbarium \"Maria Enedia Kaufmann\" of Institute of Botany (Sao Paulo, Brazil).\n\n### Extraction\n\nThe powdered shade-dried plant material was extracted three times (72 h) by macroation with hexane and, subsequently with ethanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation yielding a thick syrup. The crude ethanol extracts were further reconstituted in methanol-water (7:3) and then partitioned with ethyl acetate and _n_-butanol, successively. Samples from hexane and ethanol extracts, ethyl acetate, _n_-butanol and lyophilized hydroalcoholic fractions, were submitted to antimicrobial tests.\n\n### Isolation of antifungal compounds 1-4\n\nThe _n_-butanol fraction (2.5 g) from the ethanol extract of branches was subjected to gel permeation column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol to afford nine fractions (B1-B9), which were combined after comparison of their TLC profile [chloroform:methanol (9:1)] revealed with Dragendorff's reagent. The alkaloidal fraction (B2, 587 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase C-18 silica gel CC eluted with acetonitrile:water gradient that afforded eight fractions (ALK1-ALK8). Purification of fraction ALK5 (121 mg) by repeated CC over silica gel (230-400 mesh) eluted with chloroform:methanol in a gradient ranging from 0 to 35% methanol, furnished _N-1,N-2,N-3_-triisopentenyl)guanidine (**1**, 7 mg) and nitensidine B (**3**, 12 mg). Fraction ALK-8 (88 mg) was subject to preparative TLC developed with ch loroform:methanol:triethylamine (87:12.5:0.5), developed three times to yield nitensidine A (**2**, 7 mg) and nitensidine C (**4**, 3 mg).\n\nThe molecular structures of these guanidine alkaloids were identified through \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR, \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR and MS data. The spectral data were in agreement with those published in the literature (Bolzani et al., 1995; Conegero et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n## Microorganisms and growth conditions\n\nThe test organisms _C. albicans_ ATCC 90028, _C. krusei_ ATCC 6258, _C. parapsilosis_ ATCC 22019 and _C. neoformans_ ATCC 90012 were originally obtained from the Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Sao Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 to 48 h at room temperature.\n\n### Antimicrobial susceptibility testing\n\nThe antifungal activity tests were performed using broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications (Rodriguez-Tudela et al., 2003). The medium used was RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. Samples were diluted in DMSO and each well of a 96-well U-bottomed culture plate were added 100 \\(\\mu\\)L culture together with 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of 2-fold serial diluted test compound. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be 1 x 10\\({}^{\\circ}\\) to 5 x 10\\({}^{\\circ}\\) CFU/mL. This suspension was inoculated on the microdilution plate previously prepared with the extracts, fractions and compounds **1-4** diluted at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 mg/mL. The plates were incubated with agitation at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 24 h for _Candida_ spp. and 48 h for _C. neoformans_. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were used as positive controls exhibiting a MIC value ranging from 2.00 to 0.06 and 64.00 to 2.00 mg/mL (Table 1).\n\nThe MIC values were calculated as the lowest concentration of the test samples which shows complete growth inhibition of the fungi strains. Results were analyzed visually and spectrophotometrically. All assays were performed in triplicate. The extracts and fractions showing a MIC lower than 100, ranging from 100-500, 500-1000 and over 1000 mg/mL were considered potent, moderated, weak and not active, respectively (Holetz et al., 2002).\n\n### Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC)\n\nAll tested samples in antifungal study showing MIC\\(<\\)1000 mg/mL, were transferred to plates of Sabouraud-dextrose agar. The plates were incubated at 35 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 48 h (yeast). The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that did not permit any visible fungal colony growth on the appropriate agar plate after the period of incubation. All assays were performed in triplicate.\n\n## Results\n\nIn this work, eight extracts and twelve fractions as well as four guanidine alkaloids (**1-4**) were tested at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 mg/mL against four human opportunistic yeasts (_C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis_ and _C. neoformans_). These results were summarized in Table 1.\n\nAll extracts and fractions from _Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, were weakly active against the yeast _C. albicans_ with MIC values ranging from 1000 to 250 mg/mL, which were considered moderate to weak according to Holetz et al. (2002). The hexane extract from roots was not active to _C. albicans_ and _C. neoformans_ (MIC\\(>\\)1000 mg/mL). The extracts and fractions from roots and green fruits demonstrated moderate activity against _C. krusei_, except the _n_-butanol fraction from roots, which presented strong activity (MIC 31.2 mg/mL) against this yeast. Additionally, branches and stem barks exhibited potent activity against _C. krusei_ with MIC values ranging from 15.6 to 62.5 mg/mL and the best result was observed for the _n_-butanol fraction from branches (MIC = 15.6 mg/mL). Furthermore the hexane extracts and hydroalcoholic fractions from branches and stem barks showed moderate to weak activity against this yeast. All the samples had weak to moderate activity against _C. parapsilosis_ and _C. neoformans_, except for the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate, and _n_-butanol fractions from stem barks, which exhibited potent inhibition of _C. parapsilosis_ (MIC = 62.5 mg/mL).\n\nCompounds **1-4** isolated from _n_-butanol fraction of branches from _P. nitens_ inhibits the growth of opportunistic fungi with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.2 mg/mL against _C. krusei_ and _C. parapsilosis_, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of all extracts, fractions and guanidine alkaloids (**1-4**) were also evaluated against the four yeasts and showed MFC values higher than 1000 mg/mL, indicating a fungistatic behavior.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSeveral Fabaceae species have been evaluated for their antifungal properties (Scorzoni et al., 2007) among them _Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, a typical leguminous plant from Brazilian flora has been studied for antimicrobial activity. Previous biological studies have demonstrated that extracts from the barks of _P. nitens_ did not show antibacterial activity (Salvat et al., 2001).\n\nThe bioactivity presented for compounds **1-4** indicated that antifungal activity observed in the extracts and fractions may be at least partially due to guanidine alkaloids. It was also observed that the strongest antifungal effects of the tested samples were on strains of _C. krusei_ and _C. parapsilosis_ when compared with _C. albicans_ and _C. neoformans_.\n\n### nitens\n\nand isolated compounds displayed\n\n## Page 4\n\nactivity against _C. lrusei_, which is very significant because this yeast has natural resistance against commercial drug fluconazole (Rex et al., 1995), suggesting its potential application for treating _C. lrusei_ infections, considering a possible mode of action different from those azole drugs.\n\nThe current study suggests that _P. nitens_ have antimicrobial activity against opportunistic yeasts. Therefore, it could be an important source of antifungal compounds which can be useful for developing new lead compounds, including compound **1**, which was described for the first time in the Fabaceae family. Further chemical and pharmacological investigations are thus needed in order to isolate and identify additional constituents and establish the potential mechanisms of action.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was funded by grants from the \"Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo\", FAPESP (Brazil), as part of the Biota-FAPESP-The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br) through grants 03/021767-7 and 04/07932-7.

Additionally, three inactive neoligans, including the new bicycle[3.2.1]octane neoligan 2\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-oxo-piperol B were obtained and characterized by spectrometric methods.\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Nectandra grandiflora_ Nees is a tree belonging to Lauraceae family, which is known for economically important species such as _Aniba roseodora_ (\"pau-rosa\"), the main source of sesquiterpene (linalool)-rich essential oil used in perfumery; and species with scented leaves and bark such as _Laurus nobilis_ (bay leaves) and _Ocotea odorifera_ (Brazilian cinnamon), widely used as conditions.[1, 2] Lignans and neoligans are important classes of secondary metabolites occurring in Lauraceae species, which include several medicinally important closely related compounds as the anti-mitotic podophyllotoxin, extracted from _Podophyllutum peltatum_ (Berberidaceae), used in the preparation of the antitumoral lignans etoposide and teniposide, and the antioxidant _nordihydroguaiaretic acid_ (NDGA), obtained from _Larrea tridentata_ (Zygophyllaceae).[4]\n\n_Nectandra_ species are extensively used in folk medicine due to their antirheumatic, digestive and diuretic properties.[5] Some of the claimed medicinal properties have been substantiated by studies, e.g. on _Nectandra salicifolia_, which showed antifungal and vascular muscle relaxing properties,[6] in addition to antimalarial activity due to the presence of the alkaloid costaricin in its bark extract.[7] Previous work on _N. grandiflora_ evidenced the presence of aporphine alkaloids and antitumoral activity in its bark extract.[8]\n\nA number of pathologies are known to be ultimately associated with the imbalance of pro and antioxidant factors in living systems. Exogenous antioxidant compounds may therefore exert beneficial actions upon \n\n## Page 2\n\nsystems which have been deprived from sufficient amounts of endogenous antioxidants as in some cardiovascular diseases, tumors, inflammation, ulcer and aging.9\n\nAs part of our ongoing projects aiming the phytochemical investigation of Sao Paulo State flora,10-12 the EtOH crude extract from leaves of _N. grandiflora_ collected at Jureia State Park, Atlantic Forest, have been subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation using the b-carotene test on TLC for the detection of antioxidant compounds.13 Pure compounds isolated from this extract were further evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity towards the stable free radical DPPH and compared to standard compounds rutin and BHT.11,14 Non-active fractions were also investigated and afforded the benzofuran neolignan burchellin and two bicyclocotane[3.2.1] neoligans: piperol B and the new 2'-oxo-piperol B.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe EtOH crude extract of _N. grandiflora_ leaves was successively partitioned with organic solvents affording hexane, CHCl3, EtOHAc and MeOH extracts. The TLC test using b-carotene as revealing agent indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the EtOHAc and MeOH fractions. Chromatographic fractionation of these extracts led to the isolation of protocatechuic acid (**6**) and flavonoid glycosides afzelin (**4**) and quercetrin (**5**), which were identified through analyses of their MS and NMR spectra and comparison with literature data.15,16 Fractionation of the CHCl3 extract led to the isolation of neoligans **1-3.**\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as a light brown viscous oil and its 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals for sp2 carbons and 9 signals for sp3 carbons, including three signals at _ca._ d 56, assigned to three methoxy groups on sp2 carbons (Table 1). These data combined with HRMS analysis in the positive ion mode [(C2H2O3, (M+1)+ 357; expanded to C18H18O2O2(OCH3)3] suggested compound **1** is a bicarbonyl neolignan, with 13C NMR signals for C=O groups at d 190.5 and d 203.0.\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of compound **1** showed three broad doublets at d 2.48, d 5.08 and d 5.14, and one multiplet at d 5.89 assigned to hydrogens of an allyl moiety. Additionally, a doublet at d 0.09 (3 H-9) and a quintuplet at d 2.08 (H-8) indicated compound **1** is a guianin type bicyclocotane neolignan.17,18 The absence of a doublet at _ca._ d 5.90 for an oxybenzylic hydrogen of the related benzofuran type neoligans, gave additional support to this proposal. Its relative stereochemistry was deduced from the absence of anisotropy from the aromatic ring on the deshielded H-9 (d 0.99) evidencing a _trans_ relationship between methyl group C-9 and the aromatic ring.17,18\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} position & \\(\\delta_{\\text{n}}\\)b & \\(\\delta_{\\text{c}}\\)c & HMDC \\\\\n1 & - & 134.3 s & - \\\\\n2 & 6.47 d (2) & 110.6 d & C-7 \\\\\n3 & - & 148.6 s & - \\\\\n4 & - & 149.6 s & - \\\\\n5 & 6.71 d (8) & 111.8 d & - \\\\\n6 & 6.55 dd (2 e 8) & 119.5 d & - \\\\\n7 & 2.4\n\n## Page 3\n\nMoreover, the bicycle bridge associated with the guianin type configuration of **1** is evidenced by the absorption of H-6' at d 5.72. Further analysis of NMR spectra and comparison with literature data for other guianin-type compounds suggested the presence of an \\(a\\), _b_-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and an additional carbonyl (C-2', \\(v\\) 1760 cm-1) in the bicyclic moiety.17,18 HMQC correlations allowed the complete assignment of hydrogen signals to carbons; and HMBC correlations of C-2' to H-7, H-3' and H-7'; and C-4' to H-7 and H-3' supported the position of carbonyl groups at C-2' and C-4' in the bicyclic moiety, respectively (Figure 1). This spectrum also showed correlations of C-5' to H-3'; C-7' to H-6'; and C-1 to H-7, H-8 and H-3', which supported the position of one methoxyl at C-5', the allyl group at C-1' and aromatic ring at C-7. Additional cross-peaks in the HMBC spectrum gave support to the proposed structure for compound **1** (Figure 1).\n\nESI(+)-MS/MS experiments for the protonated molecule of _m_/_z_ 357 with dissociation induced by collisions with argon provides further structural characterization as dissociation forms major ionic fragments of _m_/_z_ 316 (24), 341 (8), and 301 (22) owing to the losses of an allyl, methyl and allyl plus methyl radicals, in addition to a fragment ion of _m_/_z_ 151 (9), assigned to the dimethoxytropilium ion. Additionally, the protonated **1**, of _m_/_z_ 357, dissociates by the loss of a neutral molecule of 1,2-dimethoxybenzene to yield the ion of _m_/_z_ 219 (Figure 2), which likely rearranges to form an acylium ion that subsequently loses a neutral C3H4 alleine to yield an ion of _m_/_z_ 179. Additional data from a LRMS experiment showed the base peak of _m_/_z_ 179 and peaks at 357, 325, 316 and 219 (see Experimental section), which gave support to the structure proposed for compound **1**. These data are fully consistent with the new bicyclooctane neolignan **1**, which is therefore assigned as (75*, 8_R_*, 1'_R_*, 3'_R_*)-3,4,5'-trimethoxy-3,7'-cyclo-8,1'-neolig-8'-ene-2,4'(3'H)-dione.\n\nCompound **2** was identified as the bicycle [3.2.1]octane neolignan piperol B and compound **3**, as the benzofuran neolignan burchellin, previously isolated from _Piper betle_ and _Aniba burchelli_, respectively.19,20 Compound **2** is a guianin type and compound **3** is a porosin type neolignan and their identification was based on extensive analyses of NMR data as well as on comparison with literature data for guianin, porosin and ferrearin type neoligans, which are widely distributed in Lauraceae species.21\n\nThe antiradicar activity of compounds **1**-**6** has been evaluated towards the stable free radical DPPH, which exhibits an absorption maximum at 517 nm, evidencing prominent activities of compounds **4**-**6** (Figure 3) and poor activities for compounds **1**-**3.** The absence of phenolic hydroxyls in the latter renders them less effective in promoting DPPH reduction, therefore appearing as poor radical scavengers. The free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids and other phenols is mostly due to their aromatic hydroxy groups, which confer great stability to the phenolic radical as soon it is formed, after one hydrogen radical donation to DPPH. The stronger activity of compound **5** when compared to compounds **4** and **6** is probably due to the catechol moiety in the B ring of quercetin along with its extended conjugation through the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl system on the C ring, which are some of the major structural features associated with antioxidant activity of flavonoids.22 The comparison with standard compound rutin (DA=81% at 50 \\(m\\) mol L-1) evidences the reported major roles of some structural\n\nFigure 1: Selected HMBC correlations for compound **1**.\n\nFigure 3: Free-radical scavenging activity of compounds **4**-**6** and reference compounds BHT and rutin.\n\nFigure 2: Dissociation routes to selected ESI(+)-MS/MS ionic fragments for compound **1**.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nfeatures of flavonoids as the catechol moiety present in the B ring and the C2-C3 double bond for the enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity.22 On the other hand, the synthetic antioxidant BHT (DA=9% at 50 _m_mol L-1) exhibited the weakest antiradicalar activity as expected, due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH.23\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 Mesh) and Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used for all column chromatography separations unless otherwise stated. HPLC separations were performed on a Waters Prep LC 4000 System and C-18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns (4.6 mm and 20mm i.d. for analytical and preparative columns, respectively) and pre-columns were used. All solvents (Merck or Malinckrodt) were of analytical or HPLC grade. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. Low resolution ESI(+)-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. High resolution ESI(+)-MS analysis were performed on a hybrid double quadrupole (Qq) and orthogonal time-of-flight (Tof) mass spectrometer (Qtof, Micromass UK) operating at 7.000 resolution and mass accuracy of 10 ppm. The temperature of the nebulizer was 50 degC. The ESI and mass spectrometer were operated in the positive ion mode. The cone and extractor potential were set to 40 and 0 V, respectively. The _m_/z scan range was from 50 up to 1000. Tandem mass spectrometric [ESI(+)-MS/MS] experiments were performed using the product ion scan mode via Q1 mass selection of the desirable product ion, q2 collision-induced dissociation (CID) with N2, and orthogonal TOF mass analysis of the CID ionic fragments. The collision energy ranged from 15 to 25 eV, depending on the dissociation ability of the precursor ion.\n\n### Plant material\n\n#### Nectandra grandiflora\n\nleaves were collected in Jureia-Itatins State Park, Atlantic Forest, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Ines Cordeiro. The voucher specimens (number: Moraes 05) were deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Botanica-SEMA, SP, Brazil.\n\n#### Extraction and isolation\n\nDried and ground leaves (2.0 kg) were extracted with ethanol at r.t. and afforded a dark green EtOH extract (5.0 g) after solvent evaporation under vacuum. Partition of the EtOH extract with organic solvents gave the hexane (0.6g), CHCl3 (1.6 g), EtOHAc (0.5 g) and hydroalcoholic (2.3 g) extracts after solvent evaporation. MPLC on silica gel of the CHCl3 extract (1.6 g, hexane/EtOAc gradient) gave 15 pooled fractions (A1-A15). Fraction A2 (41.0 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl/acetone/HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound **2** (12.2 mg). Fraction A3 (32.1 mg), obtained from the elution with hexane/EtOAc 4:1, was further purified by preparative TLC (CHCl/acetone/HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound **1** (6.8 mg). Fraction A6 (88.1 mg) was recrystallized in MeOH to afford compound **3** (25.5 mg). CC on Sephadex LH-20 of the EtOAc fraction (200.0 mg) eluted with MeOH resulted in 42 subfractions which were pooled after TLC analysis (B1-B4). Fr. B2 (38.7 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/HOAc 79:18:2:1) and gave compound **4** (7.1 mg). Purification of fraction B3 (45.1 mg) by preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 36:12:1:1) afforded compound **5** (14.0 mg). The hydroalcoholic fraction (200.0 mg) was submitted to CC on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH resulting in 10 fractions (C1-C10). Purification of fraction C-8 (37.7 mg) by RP-HPLC (C18 Luna-Phenomenex column, MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 55:43:2, 8 mL min-1, detection at 280 nm) gave compound **6** (8.1 mg).\n\n#### Bleaching of b-carotene on TLC plates\n\nSamples were eluted on TLC plates which were then dried and sprayed with 0.02% solution of b-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates are placed under natural light until discoloration of background. The remaining yellow spots indicate the presence of antioxidants.13\n\n\\[Reduction\\ of\\ 2,2\\text{-diphenyl-}1\\text{-picrylhydrazyl}\\ radical\\ (DPPH)\\]\n\nThe free radical scavenging capacities of the isolates and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated from their ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 _m_mol L-1 to 100 _m_mol L-1were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated as DA= (Ao-A)/Ao.11,14\n\n_(7S*,8R*,1'R*,3'R*)-3,4,5'-trimethoxy-3,7'-cyclo-8,1'-neolig-8'-ene-2,4'(3'H)-dione (**1**).

Their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments as quercetin-3-_O_-rutinoside (**2**), kaempferol-3-_O_-rutinoside (**3**), kaempferol-3-_O_-_a_-L-rhamnopyranoside-(1-9-6)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactopyranoside (**4**), quercetin-3-_O_-\\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranoside-[(1-4)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactopyranoside (**5**), 6-hydroxy-rutin (**6**), kaempferol-3-_O_-D-galactopyranoside (**7**), kaempferol-3-_O_-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**8**) and kaempferol-3-_O_-\\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranoside)-[(1-4)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-glucopyranoside (**9**). In addition, catechoin (**10**) and catechin-(4-\\(\\alpha\\)-8)-catechin-procyanidin B-3) (**11**) were isolated. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative properties using an autographic assay based on \\(\\beta\\)-carotene bleaching on TLC plates, and spectrophotometric detection by reduction of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Flavonoids **2**, **5**, **6**, **10** and **11** displayed strong free radical scavenging activity, when compared with the standards BHT and rutin.\n\n**Keywords**: Rubiaceae, chimarrhoside, DPPH, \\(\\beta\\)-carotene\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn recent years, flavonoids have been widely recognized as a major class of secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties due to their ability to scavenge free radicals.[1, 2, 3] Antioxidant is a broad classification for molecules that may act prior to, or during, a free radical chain reaction at initiation, propagation, termination, decomposition, or subsequent reaction of oxidation products as sensitive targets.[4] There are several diseases, whose causes and severity are linked to oxidation, mainly those associated with oxygen free radicals, which have been implicated as mediators of degenerative and chronic deteriorative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases,[5] such as rheumatoid arthritis,[6] diabetes, vascular disease and hypertension, cancer and hyperplastic diseases,[7] cataract formation and aging processes.[8] Radical-mediated pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion, asthma and many others involving an imbalance in pro-oxidant-antioxidant processes.[9] In our search for antioxidant compounds from Amazonian plant species, we examined constituents of \\(Chimarrhis\\)\\(turbinata\\) DC Rodr.. (Rubiaceae) leaves, collected in the city of Belem, Para State, Brazil. The chemical composition of _C. turbinata_ has been studied previously, and bioactive indole alkaloids were identified.[10, 12] In this paper, we describe the isolation \n\n## Page 2\n\nof a new bifluxonoid, named chimarrhoside (**1**), and eight known flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant effects, which were deduced by electrochemical detection coupled to an HPLC system, bleaching of _b_-carotene on TLC plates, and parameters related to the evaluation of antioxidant activity measured by free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nChimarrhoside (**1**) was obtained as an amorphous pale yellow powder from the EtOH extract and exhibited in its mass spectrum a molecular ion peak at _m/z_ 1171 [M+H]+ obtained from ESIMS. The IR and UV spectra of **1** revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (270, 295, 344 nm, 1690 cm-1). Part of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of compound **1** were observed in duplicate, suggesting a dimer (Table 1). Comparison of the 13C NMR values of **1** with literature data13 evidenced the kaempfero1 algvcone and additional similar spectral features to those of **3**, also isolated in this work, except for the duplication of some signals for carbons arising from a dimer structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum of **1**, signals for two kaempfero1 units as two _meta_-coupled A-ring hydrogens (H-6/H-8) and two pairs of coupled B-ring hydrogens (H-3'/H-5' and H-2'/H-6') for each aglycone were observed, in addition to four anomeric hydrogens at \\(d\\) 5.12 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) 7.7 Hz), 5.02 (1H, d, \\(J\\) 7.7 Hz), 4.40 (1H, br s), 4.60 (1H, br s), 20 hydroxymethine and 2 hydroxymethylene hydrogens. The 13C NMR spectrum of **1** revealed the presence of two kaempfero1 moieties and 24 hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene signals which, analyzed together with 1H NMR data (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of two diglycoside moieties identified as rutinosyl and a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside. This assumption was supported by signals at \\(d\\) 103.1 / 67.1 and \\(d\\) 104.0 / 65.9, assigned to C-1\" C-6\" of the glucopyranosyl and of the galactopyranosyl moiety respectively. Those signals also showed HMQC correlations with H-1\" (anomeric) and H-6\" (Table 1); as well as signals at \\(d\\) 100.9/16.4 and \\(d\\) 100.4/16.6, assigned to C-1'''/C-6''' of the two rhamnopyranosyl moieties, respectively, which also showed HMQC correlations with H-1''' (_d_ 4.4 0 and 4.60) and H-6''' (_d_ 1.17 and 1.11). On the basis of the above data, the chemical shifts assigned for each sugar: the glucosyl and galactosyl moieties were confirmed taking into account the values at \\(d\\) 103.1, 76.6, 75.7, 74.3, 70.1 and 67.1 as well as \\(d\\) 104.0, 73.9, 73.6, 71.5, 68.2 and 65.9 attributed to glucose and galactose, respectively.15 According to literature data, using the same solvent, the chemical shifts of hydroxymethines carbons in glucose are quite deshielded when compared to those of galactose. The glucosyl/galactosyl groups are linked to the rhamnosyl residue at C-6\", because the signal assigned to this carbon, in both sugar moieties, was markedly displaced downfield at \\(d\\) 67.1/65.9 (D_d_ + 6), respectively when compared with the 13C NMR spectrum of free hydroxymethylenes in glucose/galactose. This also was confirmed by the observation of a HMBC long-range correlation of the anomeric hydrogen signal of the rhamnosyl group at \\(d\\) 4.40 / 4.60 with C-6\" of the glucosyl moieties at 67.1 and 65.9, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the site of glycosylation at C-3 of each kaempfero1 moiety was evidenced from downfield shifts of C-2 (D_d_ +9) and C-4 (D_d_ +2) and upfield shift of C-3 (D_d_ -3) when compared to the aglycone,15 as well as from HMBC correlations of H-1\" to C-3a/3b within each kaempfero1 diglycoside moiety (Figure 1). Further HMBC correlations of H-6 and H-8 with C-7 (_d_ 164.6) confirmed the assignments for ring A and suggested the interflavonoidic linkage at C-7 due to the observed downfield shift of its signal when compared to the monomer.15 Moreover, ESIMS analysis showed peaks of _m/z_ 298 (70) and 133 (40) resulting from Retro Diels-Alder (RDA) fragmentations. From moiety A wherein bonds 1 and 3 undergo scission, lead to formation of ions I and II as well as scission of bonds 0 and 2 led to the formation of fragment _m/z_ 433 (30). The fragment _m/z_ 298 (70), was generated by both RDA suffered by moiety A and moiety B (Figure 2). Additional fragments observed in the mass spectra are in accordance with those reported for kaempfero1.16 These data, combined with HPLC analysis, which showed a lower retention time for compound **1** (5.7 min) when compared to monomeric flavonoid diglycosides **2** (9.8 min) and **3** (13.8 min.) (Figure 3), confirmed the proposed structure for compound **1** as kaempfero1 _3_-_O_-_b_-rutinosyl-(7\\(a\\) -\n\n## Page 3\n\npyranosyl-(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside (**4**), quercetin-3_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside (**5**), 6-hydroxy-rutin (**6**), kaempferol-3_O_-D_-galactopyranoside (**7**), kaempferol-3_O_-D-glucopyranoside (**8**) and kaempferol-3_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 6)-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 4)-b-D glucopyranoside (**9**), catechin (**10**) and catechin-(4\\(a\\) - 8)-catechin (procyanidin B-3) (**11**). These compounds were identified and their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments and compared with literature data (Figure 4).13-15, 18, 19-22, 26-28\n\nThe radical scavenging effects obtained for compounds **2-11** assayed with DPPH are shown in (Table 2) using as reference the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 21.34 _m_g mL-1) and BHT (IC50 62.50 _m_g mL-1). These results indicate that the free-radical scavenging activity of these\n\nFigure 2.: Selected fragment ions from compound **1** by ESIMS.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nmicromolecules is due to its hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the ease of stabilization of the phenoxyl radical after reduction of DPPH and is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by the IC50 values for compounds **2, 5, 6, 10**, and **11**.24\n\nIt is also evident from Table 2, that _ortho_-dihydroxy moiety plays more important role for this type of activity than the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl, as the lack of the latter, e.g. in compound **10**, contributed in a lesser extent to the loss of activity, as observed for compounds **3**, **4** and **7-9**, due to the missing catechol group.

NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 degC and referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance (CD3OD at d 3.33 and 49.0 for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR-Nicolet, model EMACT-40 Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer, in the range 500-4000 cm-1. ESIMS spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10-20 eV with argon. Silica gel 60H (230-400 _m_), (60-230 _m_) (Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) and XAD-16 (Sigma) were used in column chromatography. TLC plates were illuminated under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. For preparative HPLC, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, ODS Phenomenex,, Luna column (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 _m_m), and pre-Column (50 x 10.00 mm) were used in this study. For semi-preparative HPLC, a Supelco ODS column 8 (250 mm x 10 mm x 5 _m_m) was used. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All EIMS spectra were obtained by direct insertion of the samples, using an electric cone potential of +70 eV.\n\n### Plant material\n\nLeaves from _C. turbinata_ DC Rodr. were collected at the Viro Reserve, in the State of Para, in October 1996 and February 2000. Dr. Ines Cordeiro identified the specimen, and a voucher No. Cord-2367 was deposited in the Herbarium of the Sao Paulo Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\n_C. turbinata_ were collected twice, and the plant material obtained (1.0 kg), were dried, powdered and extracted with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) and EtOH, successively, affording extracts A and B, respectively, after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure.

The EtOH solutions were evaporated under vacuum to give a residue (57.1 g). This residue was dissolved in EtOH:H2O (90:10), and then extracted with _n_-hexane to give a _n_-hexane fraction (28.9 g). The EtOH:H2O fraction was extracted with CH2Cl2, EtOAc and _n_-BuOH successively, to give a CH2Cl2 fraction (4.0 g), EtOAc fraction (4.1 g), _n_-BuOH fraction (12.4 g) and H2O-soluble residues (7.6 g), respectively, which were screened by b-carotene test on TLC.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compounds & IC50 (_μ_mol L−1)a \\\\\n**2** & 21.3 ± 0.1 \\\\\n**3** & 62.3 ± 0.3 \\\\\n**4** & 59.4 ± 0.3 \\\\\n**5** & 30.1 ± 0.2 \\\\\n**6** & 25.4 ± 0.2 \\\\\n**7** & 63.2 ± 0.4 \\\\\n**8** & 63.1 ± 0.6 \\\\\n**9** & 61.9 ± 0.5 \\\\\n**10** & 33.4 ± 0.1 \\\\\n**11** & 11.5 ± 0.1 \\\\ BHT & 80.1\n\n## Page 6\n\nThe EtOAc (4.1 g) underwent to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 25 fractions (A-1 to A-25).

Each mixture was shaken and maintained for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin and BHT were used as standard compounds. DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in methanol (1.0 mL) served as control.

The structural novelty and diversity of fungal secondary metabolites make them a logical source of new leads for drug discovery and development. Among the 20 most commonly prescribed medications, six are from fungal origin [2]. The versatility of microbial biosynthesis is conspicuous and the filamentous fungi, as well as the filamentous actinomycetes are the two most prolific groups capable of producing novel secondary metabolites [3]. In the course of our screening program for antibiotic producers, we selected a Brazilian strain of _Aspergillus fumigatus_ isolated from Pantanal (Mato Grosso do Sul State) soil sample. The interest in _A. fumigatus_ metabolites is due to their broad range of biological activities [4]. Moreover, Symoens _et al._[5] reported the high genetic polymorphism of _A. fumigatus_ isolates, and according Debeaupuis _et al._[6], the intraspecies variability at the genomic level appears to be very high, reflecting the environmental diversity of this species. Varga and Toth [7] described a general overview of the techniques used for the examination of the genetic variability of _A. fumigatus_ and suggested that recombination played an important role in _A. fumigatus_ populations. Different strains of the same fungus species may produce different compounds using the same medium [8]. Also, the production of secondary metabolites by fungi may vary with the biotope in which they grow and to which they are adapted [9]. Fumifungin and synerazol, new antifungal antibiotics, were isolated from the culture broth of _A. fumigatus_. Fumifungin was produced by a strain isolated from a Himalayan soil sample [10] and synerazol was produced by a strain from Thailand soil sample [11]. The study of a Brazilian strain of _A. fumigatus_, aiming to isolate and identify antimicrobial compounds, was undertaken based on the wide variability encountered for this species.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Microorganisms\n\n_Aspergillus fumigatus_ was isolated from a soil sample collected in Pantanal - MS, Brazil and was identified by the \"Fundacao Tropical de Pesquisas e Tecnologia Andre Tosello\", Campinas- SP, Brazil. The microorganism is stored as a conidial suspension on silica gel (6 - 12 mesh,\n\n## Page 2\n\ngrade 40, desiccant activated) at 4 degC. The _Staphylococcus aureus_ ATCC 25923 and _Micrococcus luteus_ ATCC 9341 strains, used for antimicrobial evaluation, were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection.\n\n### Metabolites production\n\nA two-step culture was performed for secondary metabolites production, consisting of an initial inoculum of a suspension of 4 x 106 conidia mL-1. The fungus was first grown at 40 degC in five Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of seed medium each.12 After 24 hours of the incubation on rotary shaker at 120 rpm, the resulting mycelia were harvested, rinsed and transferred to a 30 liter Micros I fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), containing 20 liters of fermentation medium (glycerol 1.5%, sucrose 1.5%, peptone 0.6%, yeast extract 0.15%, NaCl 3.0%, KH2PO4, 0.06%, MgSO4. 7H2O 0.5%, CuSO4. 5H2O 0.0001%, FeSO4. 7H2O 0.0003% and dimethicone 0.01%). The initial pH value of the medium was set at 6.0, and the fermentation was carried out at 40 degC for 144 hours at 200 rpm in the first 24 hours. After that, the stirring speed was increased to 250, 280 and 300 rpm at 24, 48 and 72h, respectively. Then, the stirring speed was kept at 300 rpm for additional 72 hours, and aeration rate was maintained at 9 L min-1.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of compounds\n\nThe culture broth was separated from mycelium by filtration and submitted to three times partition with chloroform. The resulting chloroform fractions were combined and concentrated under vacuum to eliminate the organic solvent. Then, the crude chloroform extract (960 mg) was submitted to flash chromatography13 over 11 g of Si gel 60 (230-400 mesh), which was eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of methylene chloride-methanol 49:1. Thinslayer chromatography analysis of the 30 collected fractions allowed to assemble them into 19 fractions. Two active fractions (Fr-18 and Fr-19) were selected from guided bioassay, and further fractionated using an analytical HPLC system. Instrumentations consisted of a Shimadzu (SCL-10Avp, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing. Analytical chromatography of the two active fractions, as well as of the unfermented medium extract was carried out using isocratic gradient (methanol-water 35:65). A CLC-ODS (M) - 4.6 x 250 mm Shimadzu column was used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. The spectral data from the detector were collected over the 200-400 nm range of the absorption spectrum. The Fr-18 (67.3 mg) yielded **1** (2.9 mg) and the Fr-19 (41 mg) afforded **2** (3.1 mg), **3** (1.4 mg), **4** (1.7 mg), **5** (3.2 mg), **6** (2.9 mg) and **7** (2.5 mg) after being purified by HPLC.\n\n### Structure determination of compounds\n\nThe structures of the compounds were determined by spectroscopic techniques, especially by detailed analyses of their 1H and 13C NMR spectra, including 2D NMR techniques (COSY, HMQC and HMBC), as well as mass spectrometry. The relative stereochemistries of the diketopiperazines were determined on the basis of the results of Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments. A modified version of Marfey's method14 was used to determine the absolute stereochemistries of the individual diketopiperazines amino acids, which were obtained by acid hydrolysis. A small amount (100 mg) of each diketopiperazine was hydrolysed in 6 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid at 105 degC, under reflux, for 24 hours. The acid was removed under vacuum, and the acid-free mixture of amino acids was derivatized with the addition of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide (FDAA, Sigma). For that, 100 mg of the mixture of free amino acids were reacted with a solution of 1% FDAA in acetone (80 _m_L) followed by the addition of 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution (16 _m_L). Then, the resulting mixtures were kept at 40 degC for one hour. The molar ratio of FDAA to diketopiperazine was set at 2.8:1.0. HPLC was carried out using a reversed-phase column Nucleosil(r) 100-5 (4.6 mm x 250 mm ID) packed with 5 mm spherical silica (Macherey-Nagel). A linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)-MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)-MeCN (6:4), over 45 minutes (flow rate 1.0 mL min-1), was used to separate the FDAA derivatives, which were detected by UV at 340 nm. The L-amino acids (Aldrich Co.), used as chromatographic standards, were derivatized as described above, and the diketopiperazine individual amino acids were identified by co-injection with the standards ones.\n\n### Bioassay\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of the crude extract was investigated by using both agar diffusion, using Petri dish template system, and bioautography methods. For the first procedure, an aliquot of the extract, free of solvent, was dissolved (5.0 mg mL-1) in 50% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, v/v) aqueous solution and applied into the template holes on medium surface. Negative controls were run in parallel with DMSO aqueous solution and chloroform. Penicillin G (0.6075 U, 50 _m_L, Sigma) for _Micrococcus luteus_ and penicillin G \n\n## Page 3\n\n(1.215 U, 50 \\(\\mu\\)L, Sigma) for _Staphylococcus aureus_ were used as positive controls. The inoculum was prepared by culturing each organism in antibiotic Ndeg 1 agar medium (Merck) for 24 hours at 37 degC. The microorganisms were transferred to a 0.9% NaCl solution until they reached the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard. Each microorganism suspension (0.5%) was poured into antibiotic Ndeg 1 agar medium, and distributed over the plates.\n\nFor bioautography, the crude extract was dissolved (30 mg mL-1) in ethyl acetate, from which 8 \\(\\mu\\)L were applied on silica gel G60 F254 thin layer chromatography plates. The chromatograms were developed in chloroform-methanol (93:7, v/v). After elution, the plates were carefully dried for complete removal of the solvents. Suspensions of microorganisms were prepared in saline solution by comparison with the 0.5 McFarland standard. Afterwards, the suspensions were diluted (2%) in antibiotic Ndeg 1 agar medium and distributed over the plates. Gentamicin discs were used as positive control. The thin layer chromatography plates were incubated overnight at 37 degC in a humid chamber. Subsequently, the plates were overlaid with a solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.5%, m/v), and the growth inhibition was observed as clear zones on the chromatograms.15 The obtained fractions were evaluated by using bioautography technique, as described above, and the isolated compounds were evaluated in triplicate by microdilution broth method16, for which the compounds were solubilized in DMSO and diluted in tryptone soya broth in the range of 15 nmol L-1 to 2.9 mmol L-1. The inoculum was adjusted to each organism to achieve a cell\n\nFigure 1: Structures and NOESY correlations of the isolated compounds.

Penicillin G (Sigma) was used as positive control and the negative control was run for a solution of DMSO and tryptone soya broth. Also, it was included both inoculated wells, which controls the adequacy of the broth to support the growth of the organisms, and uninoculated wells, which was free of antimicrobial agent to verify the sterility of the medium. The microplates (96-well) were incubated at 37 degC for 24 hours. After that, 40 _m_L of 2,3,5- triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.7%) in aqueous solution were added to indicate the viability of microorganisms.17\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe crude chloroform extract from _A. fumigatus_ culture broth exhibited activity against _Micrococcus luteus_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_, providing inhibition zones of 21 mm +- 0.577 and 25 mm +- 0.577, respectively, by using the agar diffusion method. The results of bioautography analysis displayed two large overlapping inhibition zones, at Rf values of 0.34 and 0.52.\n\nThe chromatographic purification of chloroform extract, by using a combination of Si gel flash chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, furnished 7 diketopiperazines (Figure 1).\n\nThe identification of diketopiperazines **1-7** was straightforward based on the presence of both the characteristic 13C NMR chemical shifts for the amide carbonyl groups (d 167-172) and the 1H NMR signals of the amino acids. The presence of proline moiety as one of the components of **1-4** and **7** was deduced by the presence of methylene multiplets in the spectra (d 1.15 - 3.59, 6H) and by H-C correlations observed in the HMBC experiments. Analysis of HMBC experiment showed the correlation of C-1 and C-6 with H-3 for compounds **1, 3, 6** and 7. Compounds **5** and **6** bear a hydroxyproline moiety [d_h_4.45 (H-4), d_c_69.0 (C-4) and d_h_4.27 (H-4), d_c_68.9 (C-4), respectively] instead of a proline one. Analysis of the NMR spectra indicated that phenylalanine, glycine, valine and leucine were the other amino acid moieties present in compounds **1-7** (Table 1, 2 and 3).\n\nDiketopiperazine **1** bears the molecular formula C14H16N2O2, which was established by mass spectrometry, using electrospray ionization (ESI). The molecular weight of compound **1** was deduced as 244 by the quasimolecular ions at _m_/2 245 [M + H]+, 267 [M + Na]+ and 283 [M + K]+. The molecular formula of diketopiperazine **6** was assigned as C14H16N2O3, which contains one additional oxygen in relation to compound **1**. These data were well consistent\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} H & **1** & **6** \\\\\n1 & - & - \\\\\n2 & - & - \\\\\n3 & 3a:3.48 – 3.56 m (1H) & 3a:3.26 d (13.1 Hz; IH) \\\\\n3b: 3.33 – 3.39 m (1H) & 3b: 3.70 d (5.0; 13.1 Hz; IH) \\\\\n4 & 1.75 – 1.83 m (2H) & 4.27 hr (5.0 Hz; IH) \\\\\n5a: 1.15 – 1.24 m (1H) & 5a: 20.66 d (1.0; 5.8; 13.0 Hz; IH) \\\\\n5b: 20.4 – 2.12 m (1H) & 5b: 1.37 d (5.0; 11.8; 13.0 Hz; IH) \\\\\n6 & 4.06 d (1.7; 6.3; 10.8 Hz; IH) \\\\\n7 & - & - \\\\\n8 & 4.56 hr s (1H) & 4.56 hr s (1H) \\\\\n9 & 4.44 ddt (1.0; 4.8; 5.0 Hz; IH) \\\\\n10 & 3a.14 dd (5.0; 14.4 Hz; IH) & 10a: 3.14 dd (5.3; 14.2 Hz; IH) \\\\\n10b: 3.18 dd (4.8; 14.4 Hz; IH) & 10b: 3.18 dd (4.8; 14.2 Hz; IH) \\\\\n1’ & - & - \\\\\n2’ & 7.20 – 7.29 m (1H) & 7.20 – 7.29 m (1H) \\\\\n3′ & 7.20 – 7.29 m (1H) & 7.20 – 7.29 m (1H) \\\\\n4′ & 7.20 – 7.29 m (1H) & 7.20 – 7.29 m (1H) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD,OD, d values) data of **1** and **6**\n\n## Page 5\n\nwith theirs 1H and 13C NMR data. The 1H NMR spectra of **1** and **6** displayed signals of methylene benzylic protons groups (H-10) attached to monosubstituted benzene rings (d 3.14- 3.18). These data suggested a phenylalanine moiety for these compounds.\n\nThe 1H spectrum of the compound **2** showed the signals at d 4.06 (_J_ 2.0 and 16.9 Hz, dd, 1H, H-9a) and d 3.69 (_J_ 16.9 Hz, d, 1H, H-9b), both protons are attached to a carbon at d 45.8, as observed in HMQC experiment, indicating a glycine moiety for this compound.\n\nThe 1H spectrum of the compound **4** displayed two doublets at d 0.93 (_J_ 6.9 Hz, 3H, H-11) and d 1.07 (_J_ 6.9 Hz, 3H, H-12) indicating the presence of two methyl groups. Moreover, the signals at d 2.48 (_J_ 2.5 and 6.9 Hz, dsept, 1H, H-10) and d 4.01-4.03 (m, 1H, H-9) allowed to propose a valine moiety for this compound.\n\nThe molecular formula of diketopiperazine **5** contains one additional oxygen in relation to compound **7**. Their 1H and 13C NMR signals showed close correspondence, except for the signals of both hydroxyproline and proline residues, respectively. Their 1H spectra showed two doublets at d 0.95 (_J_ 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12) and d 0.94 (_J_ 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12) for **5** and **7**, respectively, as well as other two doublets at d 0.96 (_J_ 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-13) and d 0.95 (_J_ 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-13), indicating the presence of two methyl groups attached to the molecules. In addition, the signals at d 4.13- 4.18 (m, 1H, H-9), d 1.83- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-10a), d 1.46- 1.53 (m, 1H, H-10b) and d 1.83- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-11) of compound **5** and the signals at d 4.09- 4.15 (m, 1H, H-9), d 1.81- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-10a), d 1.47- 1.56 (m, 1H, H-10b) and d 1.81- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-11) for compound **7** allowed to propose a leucine moiety for these compounds.\n\nThe spectra data for all compounds showed signals due to one N-H proton (d 4.56, br s, 1H), with exception of diketopiperazine **3**. The EIMS data showed peaks at _m/z_ 195 [M + H]+, 217 [M + Na]+ and 233 [M + K]+, which allowed to propose the structure of cyclo Pro-Pro for compound **3**.\n\n1H and 13C NMR previously reported data for the compounds **1**, **4**, **5**, **6** and **7** are in agreement with obtained data for isolated diketopiperazines.18-20\n\nRegarding the absolute stereochemistries of the diketopiperazines, it was possible to determine that all diketopiperazines were biosynthesized from L-amino acids (Table 4). All the derivatized obtained from the hydrolysis of the diketopiperazines displayed the same retention times of the derivatized standard L-amino acids. The modified Marfey's method was successfully applied to the determination of the absolute configuration of amino acids. It was done by using a linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)/MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)/MeCN (6:4), over 45 minutes, (flow rate 1.0 mL min-1). The original method describes a linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethylammonium phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.0)/MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylammonium phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.0)/MeCN (1:1), over 60 minutes (flow rate 2.0 mL min-1).14\n\nDiketopiperazines corresponding to cyclic dipeptides have been isolated from microorganisms, sponges and from a variety of tissues and body fluids.18,21,22 These heterocyclic compounds display several biological properties, such as: antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral and plant growth regulation.19,23 Fdhila _et al._20 reported the isolation of DD-diketopiperazines cyclo (D)-Pro-(D)-Phe, (D)-Pro-(D)-Leu, (D)-Pro-(D)-Val and (D)-4-OH-Pro-(D)-Phe from marine bacteria associated with cultures of _Pecten maximus_. These DD-diketopiperazines presented a potent inhibitory activity against the pathogen _Vibrio anguillarum_, while the LL-enantiomers were completely inactive.20 Therefore, the D-stereochemistry seems to be important for the biological activity.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c} Amino acid derivative & Retention time / min \\\\\n4-OH-Proline & 14.9 \\\\ Glycine & 24.1 \\\\ Proline & 26.1 \\\\ Valine & 32.7 \\\\ Phenylalanine & 39.3 \\\\ Leucine & 39.4 \\\\ FDAA & 31.5 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: HPLC reversed-phase retention times of the L-amino acid standard derivatives\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} \\hline C & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** & **6** & **7** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 167.3 & 165.3 & 168.6 & 167.8 & 167.8 & 167.4 & 168.5 \\\\\n2 & - & - & - & - & - & - \\\\\n3 & 45.9 & 45.1 & 45.8 & 46.1 & 56.0 & 55.6 & 46.0 \\\\\n4 & 23.1 & 22.1 & 23.2 & 23.2 & 69.0 & 68.9 & 23.2 \\\\\n5 & 29.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nAll the isolated compounds inhibited the growth of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Micrococcus luteus_ only at the concentration of 2.9 mmol L-1. This result is insignificant in comparison with penicillin, for which the MIC values were established at 0.25 _e_mol L-1 and 0.12 _e_mol L-1, respectively. It is important to point out that the literature reports24 the antimicrobial activity of the cycle (L)-Pro-(L)-Phe against a clinical isolated strain of _Staphylococcus aureus_ at the concentration of 15 _e_mol L-1 but, in the protocol used in this study, no activity was detected by using the mentioned concentration.\n\nThe origin of diketopiperazines has been questioned, once several cyclic dipeptides have been found in fermentation broths and cultures of yeast, as well as in lichens and fungi.25 It is known that diketopiperazines can be generated via non-enzymatic cyclization of linear dipeptides at extremes of temperature.26 It was checked whether diketopiperazines would have been generated by heat sterilization and incubation of the medium culture during the fermentation process. However, these cyclic dipeptides were not detected in the HPLC profiles of the obtained extracts from the culture medium without the fungus.\n\nTo our knowledge, these cyclic dipeptides have not been previously reported for _A. fumigatus_, with exception of the cyclo (L)-Pro-(L)-Leu.27\n\n## References\n\n- Baker, D.
