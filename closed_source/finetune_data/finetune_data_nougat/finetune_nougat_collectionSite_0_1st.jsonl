Casearin X degraded to the corresponding dialdehyde when stored in CDCl\\({}_{3}\\). The diterpene s isolated were cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines, with caseargrewiin F being the most active and the new clerodane, casearin X, the second active compound with \\(IC_{50}\\) values comparable to the positive control doxorubicin. All isolated diterpenes showed lower activities against normal human cells than against cancer cell lines, which might indicate a possible selective action on cancer cells. Casearin X dialdehyde was not cytotoxic to cancer cells indicating that the occurrence of these CO groups at C(18) and C(19) is incompatible with the cytotoxic activity.\n\n## Introduction\n\n_-__Casearia sylvestris_Swartz (_Salicaceae_), commonly known as guacatonga, is widely distributed in the form of a shrub or tree throughout South America, but especially within the Atlantic and Amazon forests and the Cerrado biomes of Brazil [1]. The plant is of considerable scientific interest by virtue of its extensive use in popular and traditional medicine for the treatment of snake bites and in wound healing, and also as an anti-ulcer, anti-pyretic, and topical antiseptic [2][3]. Pharmacological studies on leaf extracts of _C. sylvestris_ have confirmed anti-ulcerogenic [4][5], anti-inflammatory [6], antivenom [7][8], and cytotoxic activities [9][10]. Additionally, no significant toxicological effects have been observed following oral administration of EtOH extracts of _C. sylvestris_ leaves to animals [4], and no genotoxicity was detected when such extracts were assayed against hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) and lung fibroblast V-79 cells [11].\n\nPhytochemical investigations of various species of _Casearia_ have revealed the presence of a series of oxygenated tricyclic _cis_-clerodane diterpenes in which the tetrahydrofuran ring bears two acyloxy groups at C(18) and C(19) [12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21]. Such compounds are reportedly unstable under acidic conditions and readily degrade to form the corresponding dialdehyde [16]. The caesarins A - T, isolated from the leaves \n\n## Page 2\n\nof _C. sylvestris_, represent a group of diterpenes of this type that are cytotoxic to V-79 cells in transgenic Chinese hamsters, 180A sarcoma cells implanted into rats, and mutant strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_[9][10][17]. A number of related diterpenes, the caseaverstrins A\\(-\\)C, have been isolated from the leaves and branches of _C. sylvestris_ and found to exhibit anti-fungal activity against _Aspergillus niger_ and cytotoxicity against human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cell lines [18], whilst the roots of the same plant contain a similar type of diterpene with trypanosomicidal properties [19]. Moreover, less complex clerodane diterpenes, such as (+)-15-hydroxy-3-cleroden-2-one and (\\(-\\))-hardwickiic acid [20], have been identified in the leaves of _C. sylvestris_. These compounds differ from the casearins with respect to the pattern of oxygenation and also in the configuration of the _A/B_ ring junction, and between the Me(17) and Me(20) groups. It thus appears that _C. sylvestris_ can biosynthesize both _cis_- and _trans_-clerodane diterpenoids, a characteristic that is common to various other species including _Adelanthus lindenbergianus_ (Adelhantaceae) and _Grangea madersapatana_ (Asteraceae) [22][23].\n\nIn the present article, we report on the isolation of five casearins (including the new casearin X (**1**)) and of caseargrewin F (**6**) from the EtOH extracts of the leaves of _C. sylvestris_, and on the formation of the degradation product of casearin X, **7**. The structures of the compounds were determined from spectrometric data and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. The cytotoxicities of these compounds against human cancer and normal cell lines are also reported.\n\n**Results and Discussion.** - _Isolation and Structure Determination_. Fractionation of the EtOH extract of the leaves of _C. sylvestris_ by solid-phase extraction (SPE) from silica gel/activated charcoal, followed by normal-phase low pressure column chromatography (LPCC) over silica gel and preparative reversed-phase (_C18_) HPLC, allowed the purification of a new clerodane diterpene (**1**) together with the known compounds **2\\(-\\)6**[9][10][21].\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nCompound **1**, obtained as a white powder, was submitted to high-resolution time-of-flight-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-TOF-ESI-MS) in the positive-ion mode and exhibited [_M_ +  Na]\\({}^{+}\\) and [_M_ + K]\\({}^{+}\\) ions with masses 555.2931 and 571.2659, respectively, that were consistent with the values 555.2928 and 571.2668, respectively, calculated on the basis of an empirical formula of C30H44O8 for the molecular ion. The 13C-NMR of **1** presented 30 signals that were similar to those reported for other casearins [9][10][17][20]. A broad band in the IR at 3490 cm-1, together with 13C- and 1H-NMR signals at d(C) 72.9 (C(6)1)) and d(H) 4.16 (\\(dd\\), \\(J\\) = 11.0, 5.0; H\\(-\\)C(6)), respectively, indicated the presence of a HO\\(-\\)CH group in the molecule. Similarly, an IR absorbance at 1752 cm-1 and 13C signals at d(C) 170.0, 173.3, and 173.4 suggested the presence of one AcO and two butanoate ester groups, respectively (_Table 1_). The absorption band at 235 nm in the UV spectrum is characteristic of a conjugated diene in the side chain of the casearins [9][10][17][20], the presence of which was confirmed from signals observed in the olefinic region of the 1H-NMR showing _cis/trans_ coupling of the CH2 H-atoms of a terminal monosubstituted C=C bond (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.11 (\\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 11.0, H\\({}_{\\rm a}-\\)C(15)1)), 5.24 (\\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 17.0, H\\({}_{\\rm b}-\\)C(15))) with the vicinal H-atom (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 6.79 (\\(dd\\), \\(J\\) = 17.0, 11.0, H\\(-\\)C(14))), and a signal at d(H) 5.62 (\\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 9.0, H\\(-\\)C(12)) which could be attributed to the H-atom attached to a trisubstituted C=C bond of a conjugated diene. The partial structure formed by the side chain linked at C(9) was confirmed from the observed HMBC correlations between H\\(-\\)C(11) and C(12), H\\(-\\)C(12) and C(13)/C(16), H\\(-\\)C(14) and C(16), H\\(-\\)C(15) and C(13), and Me(16) and C(13), together with the COSY correlations shown in the _Figure._ The (_Z_)-configuration of the C=C bond at C(12) was determined on the basis of the nuclear _Overhauser_ (NOESY) effect observed between Me(16) and H\\(-\\)C(12).\n\nThe signals of the O-bearing CH groups at d(C) 97.3 (C(18)) and 99.2 (C(19)), and of the two H-atoms at d(H) 7.14 (\\(s\\), H\\(-\\)C(19)) and 7.43 (\\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 1.5, H\\(-\\)C(18)) indicated the existence of a diacetal system in the C ring. Moreover, HMBCs (_Figure_) between H\\(-\\)C(18) and the CO group of one butanoate group (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 173.4), and between \n\n## Page 4\n\nH\\(-\\)C(19) and the CO group of an AcO group (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 170.0) defined the positions of these substituents. The second butanoate group was attached to the C-atom displaying a signal at \\(\\delta\\)(C) 67.4 (C(2)).\n\nThe relative configurations at the eight stereogenic centers were determined from 13C-NMR spectral data, 1H-NMR coupling constants, and the results of NOE and NOESY experiments. The _cis_-configuration of the \\(A/B\\) ring junction was deduced from the chemical shift (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 25.5) of the Me(20) group in accordance with previous reports [15][24][25]. The chemical shifts of C(5) and C(10) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 54.8 and 37.7, resp.) were similar to those described for the casearins and analogous compounds [9][10][26]. Moreover, the values of the coupling constants (\\(J\\!=\\!3.5\\) and 13.5 Hz) of the _doublet_ of _doublet_ at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 2.74 suggested that H\\(-\\)C(10) was in axial orientation. Finally, nuclear \n\n## Page 5\n\nOverhauser_ (NOESY) effects between H\\(-\\)C(10) and H\\(-\\)C(12), and H\\(-\\)C(11) and H\\(-\\)C(19), indicated a similar orientation for the side chain at C(9).\n\nIn general, _cis_-clerodane diterpenes that are not substituted at positions C(7), C(8), C(10), C(11), and C(12) exhibit chemical shifts around \\(\\delta\\)(C) 15.0 and 26.0 for the Me(17) and Me(20) groups, respectively, in the _trans_ configuration [13][26\\(-\\)28], and values of _ca._\\(\\delta\\)(C) 16.0 and 18.0, respectively, for Me(17) and Me(20) groups in the _cis_ configuration [20][21][28\\(-\\)30]. Caserarins substituted at C(7) present chemical shifts for the Me(17) and Me(20) groups of _ca._\\(\\delta\\)(C) 11.0 and 26.0, respectively, which are most likely caused by the \\(\\gamma\\) shielding effect of the O-bearing substituent at C(7) [9][10]. Caseravestrins are not substituted at C(7), which explains the chemical shift value of \\(\\delta\\)(C) 15.6 reported for C(17) [18]. In the case of **1**, which has no substituent at C(7), the signals at \\(\\delta\\)(C) 16.1 and 25.5 (associated with the Me(17) and Me(20) groups, resp.) indicate a _trans_ relationship between Me(17) and Me(20).\n\nThe chemical shift of \\(\\delta\\)(C) 67.4 for the O-bearing H\\(-\\)C(2) group, and the coupling constant observed for the allylic H-atom H\\(-\\)C(2) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.71, \\(t\\) = 4.5), are consistent with a _b-pseudo_-equatorial orientation of H\\(-\\)C(2) [13][19][26]. Furthermore, the observed nuclear _Overhauser_ (NOESY) effects between H\\(-\\)C(2) and H\\({}_{\\beta}-\\)C(1) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 2.10\\(-\\)2.14 (\\(m\\))), and H\\(-\\)C(6) and H\\({}_{\\beta}-\\)C(1), suggest that these H-atoms possess the same \\(\\beta\\)-orientation. The 1,2-diaxial coupling of H\\(-\\)C(6) with CH\\({}_{2}\\)(7), implied by the value of the coupling constant (11.0 Hz) for H\\(-\\)C(6), confirms the \\(\\alpha\\)-equatorial position of the OH group. The observed homoallylic coupling (\\({}^{5}\\)\\(J\\)) between H\\(-\\)C(18) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 7.43 (_t_, \\(J\\) = 1.5)) and H\\(-\\)C(2) requires that the \\(\\pi\\)-orbitals of the C\\(=\\)C bond overlap with the 1\\(s\\) orbitals of the H-atoms thus implying a \\(\\beta\\)-orientation for H\\(-\\)C(18) [12]. Finally, the nuclear _Overhauser_ effect between H\\(-\\)C(18) and H\\(-\\)C(19) confirms the \\(\\alpha\\)-orientation of the butanoate group at C(18) and the AcO group at C(19).\n\nThe \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR data (recorded in (D\\({}_{5}\\))pyridine) for **2** (C\\({}_{31}\\)H\\({}_{44}\\)O\\({}_{10}\\)), **3** (C\\({}_{30}\\)H\\({}_{44}\\)O\\({}_{9}\\)), **4** (C\\({}_{29}\\)H\\({}_{42}\\)O\\({}_{9}\\)), **5** (C\\({}_{33}\\)H\\({}_{48}\\)O\\({}_{10}\\)), and **6** (C\\({}_{28}\\)H\\({}_{40}\\)O\\({}_{8}\\)) were comparable with those previously determined in CDCl\\({}_{3}\\)[9][10][21]. Additional spectral data (UV, IR, HR-MS, \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR, HMQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY) confirmed the structures of these compounds.\n\n_Formation and Structure Elucidation of Caserin X Dialdehyde_**7**. Some authors have reported, on the basis of NMR experiments, that clerodane diterpenes similar to the casearins are unstable in CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) and undergo opening of the diacetal ring with the formation of an 18,19-dialdehyde [16][18]. In this context, the caseamembrins F, J, and K isolated from _C. membranaceae_ which are considered to be natural products [14][26], are most likely artefacts generated by the use of CHCl\\({}_{3}\\). In the present study, the NMR spectra of **1** measured in CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) presented signals of two aldehyde H-atoms replacing the H-atoms of the diacetal ring. When the stability over a period of one month of **1** dissolved in five different deuterated solvents (_i.e._ CDCl\\({}_{3}\\), (D\\({}_{6}\\))DMSO, (D\\({}_{6}\\))acetone, CD\\({}_{3}\\)OD, and (D\\({}_{5}\\))pyridine) was studied, degradation was detected only in CDCl\\({}_{3}\\). It is probable that the formation of **7** from **1** was promoted by traces of acid present in CDCl\\({}_{3}\\)[16], and for this reason all further NMR experiments were conducted with (D\\({}_{5}\\))pyridine as solvent.\n\nCompound **7**, obtained as a white powder, exhibited an [_M_ + H]\\({}^{+}\\) ion in the positive-ion mode HR-TOF-ESI-MS with a mass of 403.2484 that was consistent with the value of 403.2484 calculated on the basis of an empirical formula of C\\({}_{24}\\)H\\({}_{34}\\)O\\({}_{5}\\) for \n\n## Page 6\n\nthe molecular ion. The difference in the molecular formulae of **1** and **7** was consistent with the loss of a butanoate and an AcO group and the formation of a dialdehyde at positions 18 and 191). The 13C-NMR data (including DEPT-135) of the dialdehyde recorded in CDCl3 were similar to those of **1** measured in (D\\({}_{5}\\))pyridine, except of the signals of the diacetal C-atoms at C(18) and C(19) which were substituted by signals associated with aldehyde CO groups with signals at \\(\\delta\\)(C) 195.7 (_d_) and 202.6 (_d_), respectively. Similar differences were observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum in which the signals associated with H-C(18) and H-C(19) appeared in the aldehyde region, _i.e.,_\\(\\delta\\)(H) 9.92 (_d_,\\(J\\) = 2.0) and 9.38 (_s_), respectively. The structure and relative configuration of **7** was determined on the basis of data derived from 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments (1H, 13C, DEPT-135 and -90, HMQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY) in a manner similar to that described above for casearin X.\n\nCompound **7** is an isomer of caseanigrescens D-2, a degradation product of caseanegrescens D from _C. Nigrescens_[16], and the two aldehydes differ only with respect to the position of the conjugated diene in the side chain, being \\(\\Delta^{12,14}\\) in the former and \\(\\Delta^{13(16),14}\\) in the latter.\n\n_Cytotoxicity against Tumor Cell Lines._ The isolated compounds **1-7** were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against the four human tumor cell lines MOLT-4 (leukaemia), MDA-MB-435 (melanoma), HCT-8 (colon), and SF-295 (glyoblastoma), and against L-929 (normal fibroblasts). The _IC\\({}_{50}\\)_ values displayed in _Table 2_ reveal that **6** was the most active of the compounds tested, showing stronger cytotoxicity against all tumor cell lines (_IC\\({}_{50}\\)_! 0.2 mm) compared to normal L-929 cells (_IC\\({}_{50}\\)_! 1.09 mm). These values are quite similar to those obtained to the positive control doxorubicin, that presented _IC\\({}_{50}\\)_ values ranging from 0.02 to 0.83 mm to tumor cells, and 1.2 mm to L-929 cells. Considering the selectivity towards tumor cells, compound **6** was 12.1 times more active against MOLT-4 cells than against L-929, while doxorubicin was 24 times. However, if it was considered for example breast and glyoblastoma cells, while doxorubicin was only 1.4 and 3.0 times more active in tumor cells, **6** was 8.4 and 6.4 times more active, respectively. In the previous evaluation of cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines, compound **6** was inactive against KB cells (oral epidermoid carcinoma), showed significant cytotoxicity against BC1 cells (human breast cancer) and minor activity against NCI-H187 cells (human small cell lung cancer) [21]. Further studies are necessary to establish the selectivity profile for this compound. Whilst **1** is not as cytotoxic as **6**, it exhibited a good anti-proliferative potential against tumor cells (_IC\\({}_{50}\\)_! 1 mm). Compounds **2-5** displayed only moderate cytotoxicities, although it is worth noting that, in every case, cytotoxicity against normal cells was lower than that against tumor cells, indicating a possible selective action on cancer cells. Compound **7**, on the other hand, was ineffective against most of the tumor lines. Additionally, none of the compounds tested caused haemolysis even at the highest concentration (200 mg/ml), suggesting that the mechanism of cytotoxicity is probably related to a more specific pathway.\n\nCytotoxic activities against human tumor cell lines have been studied for other clerodane diterpene 18,19-dialdehyde obtained from species of _Casearia._ Thus, caseanembrin F was found to be cytotoxic to PC-3 (prostate cancer) cells but not to HepG3B (hepatoma) cells [26]. Moreover, the caseanembrins J and K exhibited no cytotoxicity against KB (oral epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (cervical epithelial \n\n## Page 7\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\ncarcinoma), and Hepa59T/VGH (liver carcinoma) cells [14], and casearnegrescens A-2 and D-2 were not active against A2780 (ovarian cancer) cells [16]. It would appear, therefore, that the presence of the dialdehyde function in these clerodane diterpenes results in the total or partial loss of cytotoxicity indicating that the occurrence of the CO groups at positions 18 and 19 is incompatible with the cytotoxic activity. In addition, the lack of an AcO group at C(6) and the lack of an O-bearing function at C(7) in the strongest active compounds (casearin X and caseargrewiin F) agree with the discussion of SAR in previous reports [10][14].\n\nIn conclusion, caseargrewiin F and the new compound casearin X showed relevant cytotoxic activity against the leukemia, melanoma, colon, and glyoblastoma cancer cell lines, comparable with the positive control doxorubicin. In addition, the lower activities of these compounds against normal human cells can be indicative of a selective action on cancer cells.\n\nThe authors are grateful to the _Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo_ (_FAPESP_), _Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico_ (_CNPq_), _Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior_ (_CAPES_), and _Instituto Flowetal da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado de Sao Paulo_ for support of the project.

Dried and powdered leaves of _C. sylvestris_ (20.5 kg) were extracted with EtOH (_ca._ 200 l) in a stainless steel extractor with solvent re-circulation for _ca._ 24 h at 40\\({}^{\\circ}\\). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 1540.0 g of dry residue. A portion (473.6 g) of the residue was separated by SPE from SiO2 (60-200 mm, _Merck_)/activated charcoal (_Synth_) (1:1, _w_/_w_) by elution with hexane/AcOEt (95 : 5, _v_/_v_), AcOEt, and MeOH to afford three fractions (_SPE1_-_SPE3_). _SPE2_ (16.0 g) was submitted to normal-phase LPCC over SiO2 (40-63 mm; _Merck_) eluted with a gradient of hexane/AcOEt/PrOH of increasing polarity (78 : 20.5 : 1.5 to 60 : 373 : 2.7, _v_/_v_/_v_): 45 fractions were collected and monitored by TLC, anal.

All cell lines were maintained in _RPMI 1640_ medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, at 37\\({}^{\\circ}\\) with 5% CO\\({}_{2}\\). Tumor cell growth was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2_H_-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates (\\(0.7\\times 10^{5}\\) cells/well for adherent cells and \\(0.3\\times 10^{5}\\) cells/well for suspended cells) and the compounds (0.019-25 mg/ml) were added to each well. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT 0.5 mg/ml. After 3 h, the plates were centrifuged, and the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 ml DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (_DTX-880, Beckman Coulter_). Doxorubicin was used as pos. control.\n\n_Statistical Analysis._ The _ICS_0 values and their 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (_Intuitive Software for Science_, San Diego, CA), from three independent experiments.\n\n_Haemolytic Assay._ The isolated compounds were assayed for haemolytic activity at concentrations in the range 1.56-200 mg/ml according to the method of _Moreira et al._[32]. Analytes were incubated in 96-well plates for 60 min at r.t. with suspensions of mouse erythrocytes (2%) in NaCl (0.85%) containing 10 mm CaCl\\({}_{2}\\). Following centrifugation, the levels of haemoglobin in the supernatants were determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm.\n\n_Casearin X_ (=(_I_R*,3S*,5S*,6aR*,7S*,8S*,1_0R*,1_0aR*)-I-(Acetyloxy)-3,5,6,6a,78,9,10-octahydro-10-hydroxy-7,8-dimethyl-7-[(2Z)-3-methylpenta-2,4-dien-1-yl]naphtho[1,8a-c]furan-3,5-diyl Dibutanoate; **1**).

The structures of **1** and **2** were established on the basis of their spectroscopic data. Iridoid **1** and saponin **2** exhibited moderate inhibitory activities against _Candida albicans_ and _C. krusei_ in a dilution assay.\n\n## Introduction\n\n_- Albertia edulis_ (Rich.) A. Rich. ex DC, commonly known as'marmelada-bola', is widely spread in the Brazilian 'Cerrado'. The _Alibertia_ genus is known for the occurrence of iridoids, triterpenoids and phenolic derivatives [2-6]. Recent phytochemical investigations of stems of _A. macrophylla_ led to the isolation of a diterpene, 2\\(b\\),3\\(a\\),16_a_-trihydroxy _ent_-kaurane [5]. Previous studies of the leaves of _A. edulis_ resulted in the isolation of ten triterpenes [7]. In our continuing chemical and biological investigations of the Brazilian Rubiaceae plant species, we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new iridoid, 6_b_-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester (**1**), and a new saponin 3_b_-O_-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosideyl-(1 - 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranoside pomolate (**2**), from _A. edulis_ stems together with known iridoids: shanzhiside methyl ester (**3**) and ixoside (**4**), and phenolic derivative 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 1-_O_-b_-d-apifuranosyl-(1 - 6)-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside (**5**). We also report strong antifungal activity against pathogenic _Candida_-species yeast and _Cryptococcus neoformans_ of the AcOEt extract of this species and, the moderate antifungal activity of compounds **1** and **2**.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n**Results and Discussion.** - The EtOH extract prepared from dried and powdered stems of _A. edulis_ was submitted to partition in hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH. The preliminary biological screening indicated that the AcOEt extract showed antifungal activity (_cf. Table 4_). Fractionation and purification over silica _RP-18_ led to the isolation of compounds **1** - **5**. The known compounds **3** - **5** were identified by comparing their spectroscopic data to those reported in literature [8-10].\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of **1** showed a peak at _m_/_z_ 403.1289 ([_M_ - H]-), determining the molecular formula as being C17H24O11, and a peak at _m_/_z_ 241.0738 ([_M_ - H - 162]-), corresponding to the loss of a hexose moiety. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic data were consistent with a _b_-glucopyranosyl unit and an iridoid aglycone. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals at d(H) 7.34 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 1.0, H - C(3)) and 5.61 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0, H - C(1)) corresponding to an iridoid dihydropyran ring. The signal at d(H) 3.64 (_s_, 3 H) corresponded to a MeO group, and the signal at d(H) 5.21 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.5, 2 H) corresponded to an exocyclic =CH2 group. An anomeric H-atom signal at d(H) 4.41 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.5) confirmed the presence of a sugar residue with _b_-configuration. The 13C-NMR spectrum of **1** showed 17 signals. The C-atom signals at d(C) 35.5 (C), 41.8 (C), 95.0 (CH), 107.9 (C) and 152.2 (CH) were attributed to C-atoms C(5), C(9), C(1), C(4), and C(3), respectively of the dihydropyran ring of the iridoid aglycone. The remaining C-atoms signals, d(C) 73.7 (CH) and 73.5 (CH) were assigned to C(6) and C(7), respectively, and the signals at d(C) 110.0 (CH2(10)) and 150.4 (C(8)) were attributed to an _exo_-methylene function present in the structure. The _g_HMBC spectrum confirmed the assignment of C(6) and\n\n## Page 3\n\nC(7) due to the \\({}^{3}\\)_J_-correlation observed between H\\(-\\)C(10) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.21) and C(7) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 73.5). The attachment of the \\(\\beta\\)-d-glucopyranosyl moiety in **1** was established as in C(1) position in the aglycone, on the basis of the cross-peak correlations, in _g_HMBC, between H\\(-\\)C(1') (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 4.41) and C(1) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 95.0) (_Table 1_).\n\nThe \\(\\alpha\\)-orientation of H\\(-\\)C(1) and \\(\\beta\\)-orientation of H\\(-\\)C(5) and H\\(-\\)C(9) is in accordance with the biosynthetic origin of the iridoids [11]. The coupling constant between H\\(-\\)C(5) and H\\(-\\)C(6) (\\(J\\) < 1.0 Hz), together with the upfield shift of C(1) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 95.0), and the calculation of the shift difference between C(3) and C(4) (\\(\\Delta\\delta\\) = 44.3) indicated that the orientation of the OH group at C(6) was \\(\\beta\\)[12]. The appearance of H\\(-\\)C(6) as a broad _singlet_ (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 4.08) provided a small coupling constant between H\\(-\\)C(6) and H\\(-\\)C(7) (\\(J\\) < 1.0 Hz), corresponding to a dihedral angle close to 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\), necessitating a _trans_-relationship between these H-atoms, which suggested the \\(\\alpha\\)-orientation of the OH group at C(7) [13]. This configuration was confirmed on basis of NOESY interactions between H\\(-\\)C(5) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 2.81) and H\\(-\\)C(9) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 3.12 - 3.15, \\(\\beta\\)-oriented), and no interactions between H\\(-\\)C(6) or H\\(-\\)C(7). Thus, the structure of compound **1** was elucidated as 6\\(\\beta\\)-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester.\n\nCompound **2** was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of **2** showed a peak at \\(m/z\\) 1127.5641 (\\([M+{\\rm Na}]^{+}\\)), corresponding to the molecular formula C\\({}_{54}\\)H\\({}_{88}\\)O\\({}_{23}\\). The \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectrum showed signals of seven Me groups at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 0.81, 0.90, 0.99, 1.14, 1.23, 1.36 (\\(s\\), each 3 H), and 0.96 (\\(d,J\\) = 6.7, 3 H), and an olefinic H-atom at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.33 (br. \\(s\\)). The \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR data confirmed the presence of seven Me C-atom signals at \\(\\delta\\)(C) 15.8, 16.4, 16.7, 17.5, 24.6, 27.0, and 28.6, and a pair of olefinic C-atoms at \\(\\delta\\)(C) 129.6 and 139.5, suggesting that the aglycone possesses an urs-12-ene skeleton. In the _g_HSQC spectrum, the long-range correlations observed for Me groups at \\(\\delta\\)(H) 1.23\n\n## Page 4\n\n(_s_, Me(29)) and 0.96 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.7, Me(30)) with a quaternary C-atom at d(C) 73.5, together with the multiplicity of H - C(18) at d(H) 2.55 (_s_), observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum, were consistent with the aglycone pomolic acid (_Table 2_) [14].\n\nThe presence of four sugar moieties was established from the signals of four anomeric H-atoms at d(H) 4.44 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.7), 4.91 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.6), 5.22 (br. _s_), and 5.36 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.1), attached to the C-atoms at d(C) 105.5, 101.8, 101.9, and 95.6, respectively, in the _g_HSQC spectrum. The C-atom signals observed at d(C) 92.1 (C(3)) and 178.5 (C(28)) in the aglycone are consistent with a bidesmoside saponin moiety. Glycosylation of the alcoholic function at C(3) and esterification of the C(28)OOH group were indicated by the downfield shift (+13.9 ppm) and upfield shift (-2.1 ppm) observed, respectively, for the resonance of these C-atoms in **2**, relative to the corresponding signals in pomolic acid [14].\n\nTo confirm our assumption regarding the glycosidic composition of this compound, an ESI-IT-MS\\({}^{n}\\) experiment was performed. In the ESI-IT-MS\\({}^{n}\\) spectrum, the peak at \n\n## Page 5\n\n\\(m/z\\) 1103 was assigned to a deprotonated molecule (\\([M-{\\rm H}]^{-}\\)) of compound **2**. An adduct at \\(m/z\\) 1139 was observed, and it was tentatively assigned to \\([M-{\\rm H}+2\\) H2O]-, which could result from the use of H2O to dissolve the sample [15]. The second order fragmentation of the adduct \\(m/z\\) 1139 led to a base peak at \\(m/z\\) 941 (\\([M-162-{\\rm H}]^{-}\\)), indicating the loss of a hexose moiety. The MS3 fragmentation from this ion (\\(m/z\\) 941) gave a product ion at \\(m/z\\) 795 (\\([M-162-146-{\\rm H}]^{-}\\)), corresponding to the loss of a deoxyhexose moiety. MS4 fragmentation from the ion \\(m/z\\) 795 yielded a peak at \\(m/z\\) 633 (\\([M-(2\\times 162)-146-{\\rm H}]^{-}\\)), due to the loss of a second hexose moiety, and the MS5 fragmentation of this precursor ion produced a product ion at \\(m/z\\) 471 (\\([M-(3\\times 162)-146-{\\rm H}]^{-}\\)), corresponding to the loss of a third hexose moiety and is in agreement with the molecular weight of the aglycone pomolic acid.\n\nThe structures of the sugar moieties were deduced by 1D-TOCSY and 2D-NMR experiments (_Table 3_). The 1D-TOCSY method [16] allowed the subsectrum of a single monosaccharide unit to be extracted from the crowded overlapped region. Selected 1D-TOCSY data obtained by irradiation of each anomeric H-atom signal yielded the subsectrum of each sugar residue. Thus, the shifts of the sugar resonances were attributable to an \\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranosyl (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.22 (H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm Rha}\\))) and three \\(\\beta\\)-d-glucopyranosyl (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 4.44 (H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcI}\\))), \\(\\delta\\)(H) 4.91 (H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcII}\\)))), and \\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.36 (H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcII}\\)))) units. The \\(\\beta\\)-orientation of all three anomeric centers of the glucopyranosyl moieties was supported by the relatively large coupling constant values observed for the H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcI}\\)) (\\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.7), H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcII}\\)) (\\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.6), and H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcIII}\\)) (\\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.1). And the \\(\\alpha\\)-orientation of the anomeric H-atom of the rhamnopyranosyl moiety was based on the multiplicity of the H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm Rha}\\)) signal (br. \\(s\\)). The absolute configuration of the sugar residues has been tentatively determined by biogenetic considerations.\n\nThe positions of the sugar moieties were unambiguously defined by the _g_HMBC experiment. A cross-peak due to long-range correlations between H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcI}\\)) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 4.44) and C(3) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 92.1) of the aglycone indicated that this sugar unit was linked at C(3) of the aglycone. Yet, a long-range connectivity between H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcIII}\\)) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.36) and C(28) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 178.5) indicated this sugar to be involved in an ester linkage with the C(28)OOH group. Similarly, cross-peaks were observed between H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm GlcII}\\)) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 4.91) and C(2\\({}_{\\rm GlcI}\\)) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 78.1), and between H\\(-\\)C(1\\({}_{\\rm Rha}\\)) (\\(\\delta\\)(H) 5.22) and C(2\\({}_{\\rm GlcI}\\)) (\\(\\delta\\)(C) 79.4). On the basis of these findings, compound **2** was established to be 3\\(\\beta\\)-\\(O\\)-[\\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 \\(\\to\\) 2)-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 \\(\\to\\) 2)-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-d-glucopyranosyl]-28-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-d-glucopyranoside pomolate.\n\nAll isolated compounds were evaluated with respect to antifungal activity (_Table 4_), and all showed moderate antifungal activity against _Candida albicans_ and _C. krusei_ in a dilution assay [17]. On the other hand, none of the compounds showed inhibitory effects against _Candida parapsilosis_ and _Cryptococcus neoformans_ within the concentration range tested (250.0 - 0.4 mg/ml).\n\nThe stronger activity of the AcOEt extract compared to the isolated compounds may be due to the occurrence of tannins that were detected by FeCl3 and gelatin/NaCl tests [18]. Toxicity of tannins towards microorganisms is well documented [19].\n\nThis is the first report of the isolation of a saponin from the _Alibertia_ genus. Among the isolated compounds, only **3** had already been reported in this genus [5].\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nThe species of the Rubiaceae family contains a great diversity of secondary metabolites: irridoids, indole alkaloids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, phenolic derivatives, diterpenes, triterpenes, and other types of alkaloids.

Data acquisition and processing were performed using the _Xcalibur_ software.\n\n_Plant Material. Alibertia edulis_ (Rich.) A. Rich. ex DC was collected in the surrounding of Apore - GO, Brazil, in July 2004 by Dr. _C. C. da Silva_ and identified by Dr. _I. Cordeiro_. A voucher specimen (SP 370.913) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo - SP, Brazil.\n\n_Extraction and Isolation._ The dried and powdered stems (600.0 g) of _A. edulis_ were extracted with EtOH (2 l, r.t., 3 d each time) to give a crude material (43.2 g), which was solubilized with MeOH/H2O (80 : 20, _v/v_) and partitioned between hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH (3 x 800 ml each one).

The medium used was _RPMI 1640_, with l-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165m morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. The test samples were dissolved in DMSO. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline soln. with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted to 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be \\(1\\cdot 10^{5}\\) to \\(5\\cdot 10^{5}\\) CFU/ml. This suspension was inoculated onto a microdilution plate previously prepared with the test samples diluted to concentrations from 250 mg/ml to 0.4 mg/ml. The plates were incubated under agitation at 37\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for 24 h for the _Candida_ species, and 48 h for _Cryptococcus neoformans_. Fungal growth was evaluated visually and spectrophotometrically. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which the optical density (OD) was reduced to 90% of the OD of the growth control well. Amphotericin B (3 mg/ml) was used as positive control and DMSO as a negative control. MIC values were determined from three independent experiments.\n\n## References\n\n* 7th, 2007, Poster Presentation.\n* [2] L. M. V.

A study of the endophytic fungi associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing 186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of _Nigrospora sphaerica_ and _Phoma betae_ liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential compounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-b-ol diterpene is being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including GC/MS, homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Asteraceae _Smallanthus sonchifolus_ (Poepp. and Endl.) H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. Some unique substances like the anti-microbial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones [1-3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF2-9), but deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South America, New Zealand and Japan [4-7]. The plant is also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal colonization.\n\nInteractions involving plants and fungi are quite complex. They may have qualitatively different relationships with a single host plant, from parasitism to mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are considered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages none of the partners, including the absence of external manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated fungi may produce substances with specific functions inside and outside the host plant in which they normally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anti-cancer [9].\n\nAs part of the bioprostecting program in endophytic fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10-13], it was considered that _S. sonchifolus_, commonly named Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce\n\n## Page 2\n\nbioactive secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and biotechnological purposes. Using this approach, 32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds. Some of the compounds isolated in this research are being reported for the first time as secondary metabolites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant associations is discussed.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Isolation, identification and preservation of fungal strains\n\nYacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in February 2006, in the city of Ribeirao Preto (S 21deg11.933' NO 47deg46.699'), State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirao Preto _campus_, University of Sao Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\n\nThe collected plant material was washed with running tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were carried out by sequentially submerging the plant material in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were excised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA medium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 mg/ml) and incubated initially at 30 degC for 48 h, followed by 72 h at 23 degC. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures. Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure cultures were obtained.\n\nConidia producing strains were identified at the Department of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil. Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 degC in tubes containing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers onto PDA slants at 4 degC.\n\n### Cultivation and extraction procedures\n\nTwo culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for cultivation and screening of biological activities of the isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures.\n\nLiquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1). First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incubated at 30 degC for 7 d. After this period, aqueous suspensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 degC for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step, this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Buchner filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This procedure was carried out for a small scale extract production for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cultures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH, followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro\n\nFigure 1: Schematic outline of endophytic fungi cultivation and extraction procedures (experimental details in text “Cultivation and extraction procedures”).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nduce the mycelial ethanolic extract (EtM). An Erlenmeyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek medium and treated in the same way for control purposes.\n\nFor the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled water per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 degC for 40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation, one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about \\(2 \\times 2\\) cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incubation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 degC, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and the residual fraction (RS).\n\n### Isolation of compounds\n\nEaS fraction (20.2 g) of _Nigrospora sphaerica_ was fractionated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column (22.0 x 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents (step A, Fig. 2). Fraction M2EaS (9.9 g) was fractionated over silica gel column (CC, 230-80 mesh, 26.0 x 4.5 cm) using a gradient from with hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to MeOH (100%; step B) to provide 22 fractions. Fraction 13 (30.1 mg) was identified as compound **1**. Fraction M1EaS (3.1 g) was crystallized from a heated solution of MeOH/H2O 9:1 yielding compound **3** (101.0 mg; Fig. 2). Fraction EEaS (1.64 g) chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 25.5 x 5.0 cm) and eluted with the same gradient as above mentioned (step C) produced 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (246.6 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 28.0 x 3.0 cm) and using a gradient from hexane: EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%; step D) to yield 9 fractions. Fraction 6 (46.3 mg) was rechromatographed again on silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 20.0 x 1.3 cm) using the same gradient elution (step E) to yield compound **2** (16.9 mg).\n\n_N. sphaerica_ fraction EaL (474.3 mg) was fractionated over silica gel (CC, 400-200 mesh, 24.0 x 3.5 cm) by elution with gradient hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%; step F) yielding 7 fractions. Fraction 7 crystallized spontaneously to afford compound **3** (98.0 mg).\n\nFraction EaS (16.5 g) originated from 20 day cultures of _Phoma betae_ (19 flasks) was chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 11.0 x 12.0 cm) under gradient elution from hexane:EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step G; Fig. 3) to afford 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (686.7 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 25.0 x 4.0 cm) by using gradient elution from hexane:EtOAc (8:2) to MeOH (100%; step H) to\n\nFigure 3: Schematic outline of isolation of compounds from _Phoma betae_.

Compound 2 (14.7 mg) was precipitated from fraction 5 (99.7 mg) using CHCl3 (step I).\n\nFraction EaS (888.2 mg) originated from 32 day cultures of _P. betae_ (1 flask, fungus sporulation time) was chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 27.0 x 3.0 cm) using gradient elution with hexane: EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step J, Fig. 3) to provide 13 fractions (Pb-1 to 13). Fraction 4 (Pb-4, 21.9 mg) was submitted to HPLC using an isocratic solvent system containing hexane: EtOAc (9:1) delivered to the a semi-prep Nucleosil 100-7 column (250 x 10 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1, and monitored at 254 nm detection wavelength at 25 degC (step K). Compound 4 (12.1 mg) was collected at 41 min. The residual fraction (5.0 mg) collected at 45 min was resubmitted to HPLC employing a prep C18 Shimadzu column (250 x 20 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min-1, using MeOH as eluent, and monitored at 254 nm (step L). Compound 5 (0.6 mg) was collected at 28 min. Fraction 13 (Pb-13, 426.8 mg) was chromatographed over sephadex LH-20 column (60.0 x 2.5 cm) using EtOH as eluent (step M) to afford 7 fractions. Fraction 4 crystallized spontaneously to yield compound 6 (18.8 mg; step N).\n\n### Spectroscopic data of compound 1\n\nPimara-7,15-dien-3b-ol (1): white powder; molecular formula: C20H32O; [a]50-3.7deg (_c_ 2.15, CHCl3); EI/MS _m/z_ (rel. int.): 288 (30), 273 (60), 255 (100), 187 (38), 145 (35), 119 (55), 107 (70), 91 (55), 80 (48), 55 (42); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): d 5.69 (1H, dd, J = 10.8 and 18.0 Hz, H-15), 5.10 (1H, m, H-7), 4.82 (1H, dd, J = 1.5 and 18.0 Hz, H-16a), 4.79 (1H, dd, J = 1.5 and 10.4 Hz, H-16b), 3.13 (1H, dd, J = 4.4 and 11.6 Hz, H-3), 0.90 (3H, s, Me-18), 0.89 (3H, s, Me-19), 0.73 (3H, s, Me-20); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): d 39.2 (C-1), 29.1 (C-2), 79.0 (C-3), 37.1 (C-4), 52.8 (C-5 and 9), 35.8 (C-6), 113.2 (C-7), 38.9 (C-10 and 12), 20.9 (C-11), 35.2 (C-13), 44.1 (C-14), 145.4 (C-15), 110.8 (C-16), 28.1 (C-17), 35.6 (C-18), 21.6 (C\n\n## Page 5\n\n_folius_ tissues possibly demonstrating tissue specificity. Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization and five other species occurred simultaneously in two tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42, SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots. Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture conditions employed. They remain unidentified and were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated were identified by traditional taxonomical methods based on morphological features as established in Table 1.\n\nThe isolated genera _Drechslera_, _Fusarium_, _Phoma_, _Alternaria_, _Curvularia_, _Nigrospora_, _Glomerella_ and _Aspergillus_ have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a range of hosts [18-20]. They also have proven to be endophytes in several plant species [21-26] strengthening the argument that disease is an exception in the plant-microbe interaction, which could be more properly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis [27]. Genus _Papulaspora_ is a well-known competitive soil mold in the culture of mushrooms [28, 29] and it has just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few species as _Vitex negundo_[24], _Manilkara bidentata_[30], _Taxus chinensis_[31], _Amomum siamense_[32] and _Solanum tuberosum_[25]. _Preussia_, however, is recognized either as a soil or a coprophilous genus [33, 34] but has never been mentioned before as an endophyte.\n\n### Cytotoxic activity of extracts\n\nFrom the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL and RS were practically inactive (data not shown). The exceptions were RLSS33, RLSS75 and RLSS84, which\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Fungal strain** & **Taxonomic identification** & **Tissue occurrence** & \\\\ \\cline{2-4}  & **Leaves** & **Stems** & **Roots** \\\\ \\hline SS13 & _Papulaspora immersa_ Hotson & P & A & P \\\\ SS16 & _Preussia minima_ (Auersw.) von Arx. & P & A & A \\\\ SS20 & NI & P & A & A \\\\ SS21 & NI & P & P & P \\\\ SS22 & Mycelia sterile & P & A & A \\\\ SS26 & NI & P & A & A \\\\ SS29 & _Aspergillus aculeatus_ Lizuka & P & A & A \\\\ SS32 & _Glomerella cingulata_ (Stoneman) Spaulding et Schrenk & P & A & A \\\\ SS33 & _Drechslera ravenelli_ (Curt.)

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetate fractions from both culture types of _P. immersa_ (SS13), _N. sphaerica_ (SS67) and _A. tenuissima_ (SS77) produced good results on all tested cells indicating that production of bioactive molecules by these fungi does not depend on the culture medium employed. These observations emphasize the significance of these species in future biotechnology studies.\n\n### Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance of isolated compounds\n\n_N. sphaerica_ (SS67) and _P. betae_ (SS84) were chosen for large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive compounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts.\n\nThree substances were isolated from the _N. sphaerica_ EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound **1** was identified as pimara-7,15-dien-3b-ol, compound **2** as ergosterol peroxide and compound **3** as aphidicolin. Spectral data of compound **2** were in agreement with literature data [35], while compound **1**, recently detected in a plant essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36]. This is the first report of compound **1** obtained from a fungal source and having its structure completely elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds **1** and **2** showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested (Table 3).\n\nCompound **3**, isolated from the EaL fraction of _N. sphaerica_ (SS67) had its structure established as the diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR data that are in agreement with reported data [37]. Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \\hline\n**Fungus** & **Cell growth inhibition (\\%)** & & & & & \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & HCT-8 & MDA-MB435 & & & & \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** \\\\ \\hline SS13 & 100.0 (HA) & 54.5 (MA) & 95.2 (HA) & 81.3 (HA) & 98.1 (HA) & 34.2 \\\\ SS16 & 32.0 & 1.6 & 31.3 & 25.7 & 35.7 & 4.1 \\\\ SS20 & NC & 10.3 & NC & 11.0 & NC & 4.1 \\\\ SS21 & 27.2 & I & 37.0 & 1 & 23.3 & 10.9 \\\\ SS22 & 100.0 (HA) & I & 100.0 (HA) & 11.8 & 100.0 (HA) & 1 \\\\ SS26 & 31.9 & 19.9 & 17.1 & 15.9 & 41.2 & 24.9 \\\\ SS29 & 40.1 & 68.0 (MA) & 60.6 (MA) & 27.9 & 33.1 & 62.9 (MA) \\\\ SS32 & 56.6 (MA) & 33.7 & 20.0 & 33.0 & 47.7 & 15.1 \\\\ SS33 & 86.7 (HA) & 3.6 & 71.2 (MA) & I & 84.5 (HA) & I \\\\ SS36 & 52.4 (MA) & 35.3 & 38.7 & 44.7 & 49.0 & 19.7 \\\\ SS40 & 3.6 & I & 10.7 & 1 & 12.0 & I \\\\ SS42 & 30.9 & 41.0 & 36.3 & 52.0 (MA) & 21.2 & 27.1 \\\\ SS43 & 33.9 & 54.2 (MA) & 49.2 & 59.4 (MA) & 25.0 & 54.5 (MA) \\\\ SS44 & 62.7 (MA) & 23.3 & 50.7 (MA) & 12.1 & 48.1 & 3.2 \\\\ SS46 & 85.6 (HA) & 13.0 & 83.2 (HA) & 30.3 & 85.8 (HA) & 9.7 \\\\ SS50 & 30.2 & I & 57.9 (MA) & I & 12.3 & I \\\\ SS55 & 55.3 (MA) & I & 1 & I & 14.2 & I \\\\ SS62 & 99.8 (HA) & 27.2 & 51.4 (MA) & 32.2 & 67.5 (MA) & 31.8 \\\\ SS65 & NC & 1.4 & NC & 10.8 & NC & 14.2 \\\\ SS67 & 79.2 (HA) & 86.2 (HA) & 48.2 & 41.9 & 73.0 (MA) & 82.2 (HA) \\\\ SS68 & 39.2 & 55.2 (MA) & 36.4 & 23.3 & 26.9 & 54.4 (MA) \\\\ SS70 & 22.1 & 32.8 & 32.1 & 41.7 & 18.5 & 18.9 \\\\ SS73 & 28.4 & I & 6.6 & I & 9.1 & I \\\\ SS74 & 24.6 & 83.9 (HA) & I & 81.0 (HA) & 8.4 & 71.3 (MA) \\\\ SS75 & 19.5 & 22.2 & 41.0 & 4.9 & 7.4 & 28.1 \\\\ SS76 & 100.0 (HA) & 48.9 & 42.6 & 30.4 & 52.7 (MA) & 40.3 \\\\ SS77 & 94.7 (HA) & 72.9 (MA) & 82.0 (HA) & 53.0 (MA) & 78.3 (HA) & 69.2 (MA) \\\\ SS78 & 4.9 & I & 19.3 & 3.3 & 6.4 & I \\\\ SS79 & 26.2 & 5.1 & 1 & 12.4 & 8.4 & I \\\\ SS82 & 87.6 (HA) & 9.1 & 45.7 & 1.4 & 68.2 (MA) & I \\\\ SS83 & 49.3 & 8.8 & 27.7 & 32.5 & 51.0 (MA) & 16.5 \\\\ SS84 & 100.0 (HA) & 12.4 & 92.4 (HA) & 10.1 & 95.6 (HA) & 15.0 \\\\ control & 25.9 & 2.2 & 34.6 & 20.1 & 25.1 & 4.7 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Cytotoxic activity of the ethyl acetate fractions from liquid (EaL) and solid (EaS) cultures of the endophytic fungi isolated from _Smalanthus sonchitolius_.\n\n\n\n## Page 7\n\nagainst all cell lines (Table 3), but its direct _in vivo_ administration is difficult due to its poor water solubility and fast metabolization. Aphidicolin also may damage a fragile site of the mammalian genome [38, 39].

In liquid potato-sucrose medium, _P. betae_ is reported to produce an assortment of bioactive diterpenes [40, 41], including aphidicolin (3), an specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resultant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1H NMR techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only compound **2** was isolated corroborating the initial low activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day cultures yielded compound **6**, which was identified as dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines tested. The subfraction 1H NMR spectrum revealed a mixture of two substances in a 1:1 ratio, later separated and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (compound **4**) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl-isocumarin (compound **5**) in accordance with literature data (Fig. 4) [43, 44]. When compounds **4** and **5** were tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities, respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound **4** against other tumor cell lines had been previously described [45, 46] but the results in this report suggest that isocoumarin (compound **5**) and ergosterol (compound **4**) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating or improving either the therapeutic effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs [47, 48] or radiotherapy [49]. Our results suggest that compounds **4** and **5** might be considered as hits for drug development of a novel anti-cancer combination therapy.\n\nThe amounts of pesticides employed in _S. sonchifolius_ cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes _P. betae_ and _N. sphaerica_ and their host have similar biosynthetic pathways [52, 53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). _N. sphaerica_ is also known to cause both reduction of spore germination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic fungi, i.e, _Fusarium oxysporum_[55, 56], one of the isolated endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore, maintenance of _N. sphaerica_ and _P. betae_ as endophytes seems to be an ecological benefit to _S. sonchifolius_.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis study was funded by grants from the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) within the Biota-Bioprospecta-FAPESP - The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br), grant n\\({}^{\\circ}\\) 04/07935-6, and the Brazilian Government's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).

The fungus led to the formation of a different product through an unusual epoxidation reaction between C4 and C5, formation of a C3,C10 ether bridge, and a methoxylation of the C1 of tagitin C. The chemical structure of the product, namely 1_b_-methoxy-3_a_-hydroxy-3,10_b_-4,5_a_-diepoxy-3_b_-isobutyroyloxygermac-11(13)-en-6\\(a\\),12-olide, is the same as that of a derivative that was recently isolated from the flowers of a Brazilian population of Mexican sunflower (_Tithonia diversifolia_), which is the source of the substrate tagitinin C. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the substrate and the biotransformed product were evaluated in HL-60 cells using an MTT assay, and both compounds were found to be cytotoxic. We show that soil fungi may be useful in the biotransformation of sesquiterpene lactones, thereby leading to unusual changes in their chemical structures that may preserve or alter their biological activities, and may also mimic plant biosynthetic pathways for production of secondary metabolites.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are a large group of natural products found mainly in plants of the family Asteraceae. They are considered chemical markers within the family and have ecological as well as economic value [10, 37]. Moreover, STLs exhibit an array of interesting biological activities such as antimicrobial [5], cytostatic [25], and antifeedant activities [30]. They are the main active constituents of many medicinal plants of Asteraceae worldwide [32].\n\nTagitinin C (**1**, Fig. 1) is an important STL occurring in the glandular trichomes of the leaves and inflorescences of Mexican sunflower (_Tithonia diversifolia_ Hemsl. A. Gray, Asteraceae) [2]. It shows cytotoxic [19], anti-inflammatory [33], and antifeedant activities [2], and thus is a promising compound for further research into its mechanisms of action in different targets. _T. diversifolia_, the source of **1**, is used in folk medicine in many countries [8, 14] and has\n\n## Page 2\n\nanti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties [8]. However, there remains concern regarding the ingestion of STLs because of their toxicity [35]. An interesting approach is to obtain STL derivatives that may have lower toxic effects or improved pharmacological activities, or both. Obtaining STL analogues, however, based on classic synthetic methods is not always a straightforward procedure, so the biotransformation of biologically active STLs is an attractive alternative providing new derivatives whose effects should be investigated [20].\n\nThe biotransformation of organic compounds by microorganisms is considered an economically and ecologically viable technology. In addition, it is a useful tool for the structural modification of bioactive natural products and the study of natural product metabolism [15, 16]. Moreover, some microorganisms can transform drugs in a similar way to mammals, and the utilization of microbial systems as models which mimic the metabolism of drugs in humans has received considerable attention [7, 16].\n\nFungal biotransformations of naturally occurring STLs have been carried out to obtain modifications that enhance activity and/or decrease toxicity [21, 24], develop structure-activity relationships [1, 4], and establish in vitro models to predict mammalian metabolites [3, 39]. A considerable number of biotransformations of STLs have been described using fungi [29]. _Aspergillus niger_ (ATCC 16888), for example, transformed costunolide into four main products, 1_b_-hydroxyarbusculin, colartin, 11,13-dihydrosantamarine, and 11,13-dihydroreynosin [20]. In the same study, _A. ochraceous_ (CECT 2069) transformed deoxyvulgarin into two products, vulgarin and dihydrodouglanin [20]. The microbial transformation of sclareolide by _A. niger_ (ATCC 10549) yielded four oxidized metabolites identified as 1_b_-hydroxystacleolide, 3_b_-hydroxystacleolide, 1\\(a\\),3_b_-dihydroxyscalreolide, and 1\\(b\\),3_b_-dihydroxysclareolide [31]. The STL artemisitene was metabolized by _A. niger_ (NRRL 599) to yield 11_-epi_-artemisinin, 9_b_-hydroxydeoxy-11_-epi_-artemisinin, and 9_b_-hydroxy-11_-epi_-artemisinin [27]. Microbial transformation of the germacranolide parthenolide using _A. niger_ (NRRL 599) and _A. ochraceous_ (NRRL 2295) yielded 11_b_-dihydroparthenolide [11]. _A. terreus_ (IFO6123) transformed dehydrocostuslactone into two derivatives, 11\\(a\\),13-dihydrodehydrocostuslactone and 16-(1-methyl-1-propenyl)eremanntholide [13]. Cultures of two strains of _A. niger_ (AS 3.1858 and VKM F-1119) transformed one of the most important STLs, artemisinin, into four hydroxylated products, 3_b_-hydrodeoxyartemisinin, 1_a_-hydroxyartemisinin, 5_b_-hydroxyartemisinin, and 7_b_-hydroxyartemisinin [28, 39]. According to the literature, the main enzymatic reactions of STLs that are able to be catalyzed by _Aspergillus\n\nFig. 1: Proposal of biotransformation of **1** into **2** by _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 (adapted from Spring et al. [38])\n\n## Page 3\n\nspecies are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation.\n\nThus, with the aims of obtaining new, potentially bioactive compounds, and giving insights into the new metabolic reactions of STLs, we carried out the biotransformation of tagitinin C (**1**, Fig. 1) by the fungus _Aspergillus terreus_ MT 5.3.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Isolation of tagitinin C (**1**)\n\nLeaves of _Tithonia diversifolia_ (400 g) were collected by B. A. Rocha, in May 2007, in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. The material was identified by F. B. Da Costa, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the SPFR Herbarium, Department of Biology, Ribeirao Preto, SP, University of Sao Paulo, under the number FBC #126. Air-dried entire leaves were rinsed for a few seconds with dichloromethane, for dissolution of the glandular trichomes [2], thereby yielding 5 g of a yellow crude extract after filtration with common filter paper and solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. The dry residue was re-suspended in MeOH/H2O (7:3, v/v) and extracted with _n_-hexane followed by dichloromethane. After solvent evaporation, the dichloromethane layer was fractionated over silica gel 60H (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7736) by vacuum liquid chromatography [9] using increasing amounts of ethyl acetate in _n_-hexane, thereby yielding nine fractions of 250 ml each. The tagitinin C-rich fractions (3 and 4) (1.5 g, confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, TLC, and reversed-phase HPLC analysis, as well as comparison with an authentic sample [2]) were purified by centrifugal chromatography (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7749; 4 mm thickness; _n_-hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 6:3:1 v/v as eluent; flow rate 2 ml/min; UV lamp 254 nm). For final purification, preparative TLC was used (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730; 1 mm thickness; _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate/chloroform 5:3:2 v/v, and 2 % acetic acid as eluent). The isolated compound (**1**, 200 mg) was analyzed by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to check its purity before the biotransformation procedure. The 1H NMR spectral data of compounds (**1** and **2**) were in accordance with those reported [2].\n\n### Biotransformation procedure and analysis\n\nScreening was performed on a small scale (30 ml of fermentation medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks) to select efficient conditions for the biotransformation of **1**. The trials for screening procedures were performed as previously described by Krishna-Kumari et al. [17]. _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 was cultivated in malt extract medium and incubated at 30 degC for 7 days to obtain spores. After that, the spores were harvested using a 2 % Tween 80 aqueous solution and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. The pre-fermentative medium was inoculated with 1 x 107 spores/ml and incubated with agitation (150 rpm) at 30 degC for 48 h. The resulting mycelium was harvested, rinsed with sterilized H2O, and transferred to fresh Czapek medium (initial pH 6.0). The culture was then incubated under the same conditions for 10 days. After 24 h, 0.1 mg/ml of **1**, which had been previously dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (3 mg dissolved in 300 ml), was added to the culture medium. Control flasks contained culture medium with the fungus but without **1**, culture medium with the fungus and dimethyl sulfoxide and without **1**, culture medium with **1** and without the fungus, or only the culture medium. A time course study was carried out as follows. One Erlenmeyer flask was taken every 24 h; the product was extracted with dichloromethane, and then analyzed by TLC to check the degree of transformation of compound **1**. TLC was carried out on silica gel GF254 (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730) plates (0.25 mm thickness, 20 x 20 cm), and the spots were visualized after spraying the plates with vanillin/sulfuric acid (1 % H2SO4 in ethanol).\n\nThirty milligrams of **1** was used for the preparative-scale incubation with _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 for 120 h, at 150 rpm, and 30 degC. The culture broth was filtered using filter paper and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting residue (45 mg) was subjected to separation by HPLC in a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp liquid chromatograph with an SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector (Japan) using a C-18 column (Shimadzu, Japan, ODS Shim-pack 5 mm, 4.6 x 250 mm; flow rate of 1 ml/min; DAD detection). The main metabolite (**2**, 4 mg) was purified after repeated injections according to the following gradient: 0.1 min 20 % MeCN, 35 min 60 % MeCN, 38 min 100 % MeCN, 43 min 100 % MeCN, 48 min 20 % MeCN, and 53 min 20 % MeCN. Compounds **1** and **2** were observed at retention times of 24 and 29 min, respectively (UV detection set at 210 nm). Comparison of the HPLC profiles of the controls with those bio-transformed ensured that **1** had been converted to **2** through microbial catalysis.\n\nThe structures of compounds **1** and **2** were determined by HR-ESIMS, 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques, and comparison of the spectroscopic data with an authentic sample and published data [2]. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker (Germany) DPX 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H). Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Aldrich (USA). High-resolution mass \n\n## Page 4\n\nspectra were recorded on a UltrOTOFq-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA).\n\n### Microorganism\n\n_Aspergillus terreus_ MT 5.3 was isolated from soil in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and identified by C. M. S. Motta from \"Colecao de Culturas-Microeca URM-Departamento de Nicologia/CCB-UFP\", Av. Prof. Nelson Chaves s/no., Cidade Universitaria, 50670-420, Recife, Brazil. The fungus was maintained by periodic transfers on PDA at 8 degC.\n\nThe microorganism _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 was deposited in the collection \"Colecao de Culturas Tropicais\" (Tropical Culture Collection) of Andre Tosello Foundation (www. fat.org.br), under accession number CCT-7640.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nHuman promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, as described by Mossman [23]. The MTT (Sigma, USA) solution at a final concentration of 500 mg/ml was added to the culture medium 4 h before the end of the treatment, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide to the cell culture. For cell treatment we used compounds **1** and **2**, at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 mg/ml. Non-treated culture cells were used as a negative control, and cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's \\(t\\) test; and Dunnett's test was used for multiple comparisons. A \\(p\\) value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results are expressed as the mean +- SEM.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe transformation of **1** by _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 yielded the unusual STL **2** as the main compound. This was identified as 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-3,10_b_-4,5_a_-diepoxy-8_b_-isobutyroyloxygermacr-11(13)-en-6\\(a\\),12-olide. The 1H NMR spectral data of **1** and **2** are shown in Table 1. Although several researchers worldwide have chemically investigated _T. diversifolia_, compound **2** was isolated only from a Brazilian population [2]. As already mentioned, it should be emphasized that the main enzymatic reactions that _Aspergillus_ promotes in STLs are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation [6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 39, 40]. Interestingly, we have uncovered an unusual epoxidation between C4 and C5; a methoxy group was added at C1, and a C1,C10 ether bridge was formed in the 10-membered ring of **1**. Nevertheless, the exocyclic double bond at C11-C13 was preserved. Compound **2** was recently isolated from a rinse extract of the inflorescences of Brazilian _T. diversifolia_ [2]. Although its chemical structure is already known, this is the first time that **2** has been obtained as a microbial biotransformation product. An interesting observation is that the _Aspergillus_ strain used in our work was able to catalyze chemical reactions that mimicked those which occur inside the glandular trichomes from the inflorescences of _T. diversifolia_. Glandular trichomes of Asteraceae species are the places where the biosynthesis of STLs usually occurs, and possibly where **1** is converted to **2**. Thus, this fungus can be used as an alternative means of gaining **2** from **1**, therefore confirming the potential of biotransformation of natural compounds by microorganisms, as well as their ability to mimic plant biosynthetic pathways [34].\n\nSpring et al. [38] reported the isolation of a closely related analogue of **1** from _Viguiera quinqueremis_ (Asteraceae), and proposed its conversion to the hemiketal form, such as **1b** depicted in Fig. 1. The structural differences between the previously reported analogue and **1** are the nature of the C8 side-chain ester (methylbutyrate instead of isobutyrate) and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C15. The authors also discussed a spontaneous methoxylation of the **1a** analogue at C1 in the presence of MeOH, thereby leading to the formation of an analogue of **1b** (Fig. 1) [38]. Thus, it could be argued in our work that **2** is a compound produced by _A. terreus_ starting from **1b**, an artifact that had\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} H & **1** & **2** \\\\\n1 & 6.93 d (16.9) & 3.99 dd (6.7, 10.4) \\\\\n2a & 6.26 d (16.9) & 2.57 dd (6.7, 12.5) \\\\\n2b & – & 1.93 dd (10.7, 12.6) \\\\\n5 & 5.88 d (9.0) & 3.33 s \\\\\n6 & 5.41 d (9.0) & 5.13 dd (4.65) \\\\\n7 & 3.55 m & 4.33 dddd \\\\\n8 & 5.33 ddd (3.2, 6.0, 10.0) & 5.53 dd (4.2; 7.1, 11.0) \\\\\n9a & 2.40 dd (6.0, 13.8) & 1.74 dd (11.1, 14.7) \\\\\n9b & 2.00 dd (10.0, 13.8) & 1.66 dd (4.8, 14.7) \\\\\n13a & 6.36 d (1.7) & 6.29 dd (2.8) \\\\\n13b & 5.81 d (1.8) & 5.62 dd (2.3) \\\\\n14 & 1.53 s & 1.50 s \\\\\n15 & 1.95 s & 1.44 s \\\\\n2′ & 2.44 sept & 2.41 sept \\\\\n3′ & 1.06 d (7.1) & 1.05 d (7.0) \\\\\n4′ & 1.03 d (7.1) & 1.04 d (7.0) \\\\ \\textasciitilde{}OMe & – & 3.35 s \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: 1H NMR spectral data of compounds **1** and **2** (500 MHz, CDCl3, \\(J\\) in Hz)\n\n## Page 5\n\noriginated from **1** in the presence of MeOH. Nevertheless, a spontaneous interconversion where **1** was converted to **1b** would never occur in methods such as ours, because MeOH was not used in any step of the experimental procedure, either for isolation, analysis, or structure elucidation of **1**. Compound **2** is therefore a natural product obtained by biotransformation of **1**. In addition, the crude extract from the leaves of _T. diversifolia_ used in this work had been screened for the presence of **2** by HPLC-DAD analysis, and it was not detected even as a trace.\n\nAccording to Barrero et al. [6], epoxidation and hydrogenation reactions of the exocyclic double bond at C11-C13 seem to be the most common processes in the microbial transformation of STLs by filamentous fungi. In order to explain the formation of the epoxide group between C4 and C5 in the biotransformed molecule **2** as well as the methoxylation of C1, we followed the proposal of Onken and Berger [26]. The authors state that terpenoids are preferentially dissolved in the cell membranes of fungi, thereby inducing changes in properties of the membrane and causing toxicity. Fungi react against these effects and co-metabolize compounds to others that are more water soluble, thus showing that the enzyme systems involved in this process of detoxification are comparable to those of other eukaryotic cells. In the first step, monooxygenases of cytochrome P450 catalyze the oxyfunctionalization of the molecules [12, 22]. Then, in the second step, more water-soluble products are formed by the action of hydrolases or conjugation by glutathione S-transferases [6, 12]. Thus, the biotransformation of **1** leading to **2** might be part of a detoxification process created by the fungus.\n\nThe cytotoxicity bioassay was designed to observe whether **1** and **2** could elicit cell death at the selected concentrations. Both compounds showed cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells lines comparable to that of the positive control, which was statistically significant when compared with the negative control (_p_ < 0.05). The results indicated that **1** and **2** have cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells at the lowest tested doses. Similar results were found while using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where **1** and **2** also presented cytotoxic effects, thus indicating non-selective toxicity. It has previously been shown that **1** has cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells [19], but its activity has not yet been compared with that of the derivative **2**. In the same work, compound **1b** was isolated from _T. diversifolia_ as a natural compound and was found to be approximately 10 times more active than **1**. In our work, compound **2**, a C4-C5 epoxy derivative of **1b**, had a statistically similar activity to **1**.\n\nKupchan et al. [18] demonstrated that the in vitro cytotoxicity of STLs against human carcinoma was dependent on the presence of the a-methylene-g-lactone moiety. Moreover, evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of further derivatives indicated which functional groups contributed to the activity. So-called active functional groups have therefore been proposed for several STLs. It has been verified, for example, that an extra a,b-unsaturated moiety contributed to enhancing the activity of STLs with the a-methylene-g-lactone group, whereas the compounds containing only this additional unsaturation did not present significant activity [18]. In another study, it was confirmed that among other structural and electronic factors, the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl structure elements (cyclopentenone and a-methylene-g-lactone) are correlated with cytotoxicity [36]. In our work, compound **1**, containing three a,b-unsaturated moieties, had statistically similar activity to **2**, with only one a,b-unsaturated moiety. This suggested therefore that its extra unsaturations were not important to the effect observed in HL-60 cells.\n\nIn summary, we have observed that in the presence of compound **1**, enzymes from _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 were able to generate **2** in the same way as the enzymes located in the glandular trichomes of _T. diversifolia_. This fungus can thus be used as an alternative source of **2** because it mimics plant biosynthetic processes. The absence of two a,b-unsaturations in **2** did not improve or decrease its cytotoxic activity in the HL-60 cells when compared with **1**. Finally, we suggest that the mammalian metabolism of **1** after oral consumption of preparations containing _T. diversifolia_ leaves should be researched in future, because this STL may form toxic compounds when metabolized.\n\n## References\n\n- Aleu J, Hanson JR, Galan RH, Collado IG (1999) Biotransformation of the fungistatic sesquiterpenoid patchoulol by _Botrytis cinerea_.

Vieira\n\nPermanent address: Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, CEP 13560, Brazil.\n\nIsao Kubo\n\n###### Abstract\n\nFour quinoline alkaloids were isolated from stems of _Galipea bracteata_. In addition to one new compound, 2-(3,_A_'-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)-quinoline, three were identified as the known compounds 2-_n_-propylquinoline, 2-_n_-pentylquinoline and 2-(1'-pentenyl)-quinoline. However, this is the first report of their isolation from a natural source. All alkaloids showed an inhibitory effect on shoot and root growth of lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_). Three of them also showed molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail, _Biomphalaria glabrata_, involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Rutaceae is represented by a great number of species in tropical areas. Many of these species have never been the target of a photochemical investigation. In our continuing effort to find biologically active compounds we have investigated _Galipea bracteata_. In this paper we report the isolation and identification of one new alkaloid and three known ones from _G. bracteata_ collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The growth inhibitory effect against lettuce of the alkaloids, as well as, their molluscicidal activity are also described.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe dichloromethane extract of the stems of _G. bracteata_ afforded four alkaloids 1-**4**. The combination of various routine 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectrometric analyses allowed us to attribute the formulas C12H13N. C14H17N. C14H15N and C18H15NO2 to compounds 1-**4**, respectively. 1H NMR (Table 1) showed signals of six aromatic protons for all compounds at \\(\\delta 7.24 + 0.04\\), \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-3; \\(\\delta 8.02 + 0.02\\)_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-4; \\(\\delta 7.74 + 0.02\\)_dd_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-5; \\(\\delta 7.47 + 0.04\\)_td_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-6; \\(\\delta 7.66 + 0.04\\)_td_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-7 and \\(\\delta 8.01 + 0.01\\)_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, H-8. An exception was the signal corresponding to H-3 of compound 3 at \\(\\delta 7.51\\). The similarities of the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the four compounds suggest that a 2-substituted quinoline system is the structural basis for all compounds, and that the difference between them is the type of substituent attached to C-2. Compound **1** possesses a _n_-propyl moiety characterized by the signals in the 1H NMR at \\(\\delta 2.91\\) (_t_), \\(\\delta 1.81\\) (_sext_, \\(J\\) = 7.4 Hz), \\(\\delta 0.91\\) (_t_), integrating 2:2:3, respectively. Confirmation of this unit can be taken from the 13C NMR signals at \\(\\delta 41.30\\), \\(23.25\\) and \\(13.99\\), which can be attributed to C-1', C-2' and C-3', respectively.\n\nCompounds **2** and **3** are very closely related to each other and to compound **1**. The mass spectra showed the parent peak at _m_/2 199 and 197 for **2** and **3** respectively, indicating that the difference between **2** and **3** is two hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the 1H NMR of both compounds showed that **2** has two more signals in the olefinic region [\\(\\delta 6.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n= 7.8, 1.2 Hz), as well as by the presence of a methylenedioxy ring assigned to the signal at \\(d\\) 5.90 integrating for two protons. The presence of a piperonyl moiety is once more confirmed by the mass spectrum which show-cd a peak at _m_/_z_ 135. The parent peak of _m_/_z_ 277 requires a methylenedioxyphenylethyl as the substituent of this quinoline. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. The compounds 2-methyl(**5**) and 2-aminoquinoline(**6**) were used as models [1,2].\n\nThe alkaloids isolated showed inhibitory effects on the growth of lettuce seedlings and molluscicidal activity as determined according to the methods described previously [3,4]. All compounds at concentrations larger than 500 ppm inhibited both shoot and root growth in the lettuce test. At lower concentrations their activities were diminished. When the concentration was decreased to 100 ppm, only compounds **3** and **4** showed activity but at this concentration, **1** and **2** had no activity.\n\nMolluscicidal activity was exhibited by compounds **2**-**4**. Compound **1** was not molluscicidal even at 100 ppm. Compound **4** had the most powerful molluscicidal activity killing snails at a concentration of only 5 ppm. Compounds **2** and **3** possessed activities at 20 and 10 ppm, respectively.\n\nOur results suggest that the presence of a second aromatic ring at C-2 increases the activity of the compounds, and that the activity of 2-alkylquinolines depends on the length of the alkyl chain. It is important to note that very few examples of naturally occurring alkaloids have been found to exhibit molluscicidal activity [5], although recently, some potent molluscicidal alkaloids were isolated from members of the Meliaceae [6]. It is also important to mention that few species of the genus _Galipea_ have been studied. However, in a unique example presented by Mester [7], the alkaloids isolated were 2-substituted quinolines. We suspect that there should be a tendency for this genus to produce this class of compound.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Isolation of constituents. Galipea bracetata\n\nwas collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil, a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias, USP, Sao Paulo. Dried stems (920 g) were extd with CH2Cl2 at room temp. for 4 days. The ext was evapd to dryness yielding (5.567 g) of crude extract. A portion of this ext (1.463 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (50 g) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2, EtOHAc and MeOH). Alkaloids were found in fs 16-35. They were then sepd by low pressure chromatography on silica gel (Lichropenyl using hexane-EtOAc (49:1), affording **1** (31 mg), **2** (10 mg), **3** (15 mg) and **4** (113 mg).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n2-n-_Propylquinoline_ (1) [83].

These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide _N_-[7-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_),4(_Z_)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of _Piper hispidum_ H.B.K. (Alecio et al., 1998).\n\nIn this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elucidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (_3Z_,_5Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptacionamide (**1**), (_S_Z_)-N_-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-D\\({}^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one (**2**) and also of eight known antifungal amides _N_-[3-(6'-methoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_)-propenoylpyrrolidine (**3**), piperamine (**4**), _N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-D\\({}^{3}\\) -pyridin-2-one (**5**), piperatine (**6**), piperine (**7**), D\\({}^{\\alpha,\\beta,}\\)-dihydropyiperine (**8**), 5,6-dihydropyiperlonguminine (**9**) and pellitorine (**10**). The amides isolated from stems of _Piper hispidum_ (**1**, **3** and **4**) and from seeds of _Piper tuberculatum_ (**2**, **5-10**) were active against the fungus _Cladosporium sphareospermum_ as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nA CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of _P. hispidum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by HPLC purification to afford the compounds **1, 3** and **4**.\n\nCompound **1**, has a molecular formula C\\({}_{18}\\)H\\({}_{23}\\)NO\\({}_{3}\\) as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) and of the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cm \\({}^{1}\\). Its \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at \\(d\\) 5.91 (2H, _s_), and four olefine protons which showed signals at \\(d\\) 5.45 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)3,4 = 12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)4,3 and 4,5 = 12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)5,4 and 5,6 = 12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, _dt_, \\(J\\)6,5 and 6,7 = 12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that both double bonds\n\n## Page 2\n\npossess the Z configuration (Alecio et al., 1998; Shah et al. 1986). The assignments of these olefinic protons were confirmed by analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylene protons H-8 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.62 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J_{8,7}\\) = 7.0 Hz) and H-7 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.46 (2H, m) were confirmed by the DQ-COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 5.94, 1H) could be also observed.\n\nThe presence of a isobutyl moiety was confirmed by the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.13 (2H, \\(dd\\), \\(J_{1^{\\prime},2^{\\prime}}\\) = 7.0 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 1.80 (1H, \\(m\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 0.92 (6H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{3^{\\prime},2^{\\prime}\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nexchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of **1** are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-field region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at \\(d\\) 166.5, ten olefinic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [d_C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at \\(d\\) 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (Alecio et al., 1998; Araujo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of **1** was determined as (3\\(Z\\),5_Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide.\n\nA CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of _P. tuberculatum_ was fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to afford compounds **2** and **5-10**.\n\nCompound **2**, was shown to have a molecular formula C17H19NO5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) and of 13C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cm 1 (asymmetric C-O-C stretching). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** revealed the presence of methoxyphenyl groups by the signals at \\(d\\) 3.84 (6H, _s_), \\(d\\) 3.85 (3H, _s_), one aromatic proton signal at \\(d\\) 6.76 (2H, _s_) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four olefinic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spectrum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at \\(d\\) 6.48 assigned to H-8 (_J_8,9 = 12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at \\(d\\) 6.71 assigned to H-9 (_J_9,8 = 12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the \\(Z\\) configuration. The attribution of this configuration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the \\(Z\\) isomer when compared with the \\(E\\) isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at \\(d\\) 5.98 (_J_3,4 and 3,5 = 9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at \\(d\\) 6.89 (_J_4,3 and 4,5 = 9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at \\(d\\) 5.98 (_J_3,4 and 3,5 = 9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at \\(d\\) 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at \\(d\\) 3.97 (_J_6,5 = 7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-field region of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four olefinic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at \\(d\\) 165.7 and 168.1. The assignments\n\n## Page 4\n\nof the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at \\(d\\) 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at \\(d\\) 6.48 (H-8) and \\(d\\) 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at \\(d\\) 165.7 was assigned to C-2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at \\(d\\) 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-field region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [_d_c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at \\(d\\) 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide **2** was defined as 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-D3-pyridin-2-one.\n\n_N_- (12, 13, 14- Trimethoxyphenylhydrocinnamoyl)-D3 -pyridin -2- one (**5**), D_a_b_- dihydropyiperine (**8**) and 5,6-dihydropyiperlonguminine (**9**) have the molecular formula C17H21NO5, C17H21NO3 and C16H21NO3, respectively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from _Piper rugosum_ (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), _Piper guineense_ (Parmar et al., 1997) and _P. tuberculatum_ (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the first time.\n\n_N_-[3-(6'-methoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenyl]pyrrolidine (**3**) was previously isolated from _Piper pequloides_ (Shah et al., 1986) and _P. hispidum_ (Alecio et al., 1998). Piperamine (**4**) was previously obtained from _Piper nigrum_ (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and _P. hispidum_ (Alecio et al., 1998). Piplartine (**6**) was previously described from _Piper aborescens_ (Duh et al., 1990) and _P. tuberculatum_ (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (**7**) was previously described from _P. aborescens_ and _P. tuberculatum_ (Araujo-Junior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (**10**) had been reported from _Cissampelos glaberrina_ (Rosario et al., 1996).\n\nThe antifungal activity of amides **1-10** was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds **1-10** are shown in Table 3 and were performed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of _C. sphaerospermum_ growth at that level were considered inactive.\n\nThe minimum quantity of compounds **1-4**, **6**, **8-10** necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for **7** and **5** the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively.

HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reverse phase column (Waters Nova Pack, C18; 3.9 x 150 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (3:2), flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 260 nm. Elemental analysis were performed on a Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Piper hispidum_ H.B.K. stems were collected in Parque Estadual do Morro do Diabo, Teodoro Sampaio, SP and identified by Dr. Waldir Mantovani (Instituto de Biociencias -- USP). _P. tuberculatum_ Jacq. seeds were collected in the Campus do INPA (Manaus) and identified by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias -- USP, Sao Paulo.\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\nThe microorganism used in the antifungal assay _C.phaerospermum_ (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay -- 10 ul of solutions corresponding to 100 ug of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 ug of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of _C. spharoospermum_ in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25degC. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the minimal amount of **1-10** required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 ug) and miconazole (0.5 ug) were used as positive controls.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nThe dried and powdered stems of _P. hispidum_ (28.0 g) were extracted with CH2Cl2 (3x150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give **1** (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give **3** (0.004 g). Frs containing **4** were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of _P. tuberculatum_ (24.3 g) were extracted CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 x 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromatographic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **2** (0.024 g) and **6** (0.003 g). Fraction 20 (0.146 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **5** (0.005 g). Fraction 19 (0.083 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions] to yield **7** (0.012 g) and **8** (0.007 g). Frs. 8 and 13 yielded **10** (0.079 g) and **9** (0.018 g), respectively.\n\n### (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxy-phenyl)-heptadienamide (1)\n\nFound: C, 71.54; H, 7.56; N, 4.45; O, 16.43%.

(Phytolacaceae) is a shrub widely distributed in South and Central America. It grows in all regions of Brazil where it is known by many popular names. Among these, \"erva-guine\", \"guine\", \"pipi\" and \"tipi\"; and the Tupi-Guarani \"macuracaa\" are noteworthy (Hoehne, 1939; Pio Correa, 1969). In the State of Minas Gerais the roots of this plant are used to treat rheumatism (De Sousa et al., 1987) and in other Brazilian regions, both the roots and the leaves are popularly used as stimulants and abortefacients (Da Silva, 1935). Previous work on _P. alliacea_ revealed the occurrence of coumarins, triterpenes and flavonoids (Rocha and Da Silva, 1969; Delle Monache and Suarez, 1992), amino acids and trisulphide (Adegosan, 1974). In continuing our search for biologically active compounds from the Brazilian flora (Carbonezi et al., 1999), a CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)/MeOH (2:1 v/v) extract of the roots of this plant was selected for phytochemical investigation due to its significant activity against some mutant yeast strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (Gunatilaka et al., 1994) and inhibition of the growth of _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphareospermum_ (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). This study led to the isolation of five new polysulphides (**2**, **3**, **5**, **6** and **7**), together with two known compounds (**1**, **4**). Among the known compounds described in this study, only compound **4** had been previously isolated from this plant species (De Sousa et al., 1990).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)/MeOH (2:1) extract of roots of _P. alliacea_ L. inhibited strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (RS 188N, RS 52YK and RS 321) indicating strong activity of this extract towards the mutant strains of yeast. This extract was also shown to possess potent inhibitory activity against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _Cladosporium sphaerosporum_ fungi. Solvent-solvent partitioning of the bioactive crude extract afforded hexane, CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) and EtOAc fractions, in which the activities were concentrated. These fractions were individually subjected to silica gel column chromatography, using CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) or CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)/MeOH as eluents, to obtain six major bioactive fractions. The purification of these fractions was performed on silica gel preparative TLC, reversed-phase Sep Pak cartridge and HPLC affording seven bioactive polysulphide compounds.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nThe molecular formula of compound **1** was determined as C6H14S2, by 1H, 13C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Three resonances at \\(d\\) 2.66 \\(t\\) (_J_ = 7.25 Hz), \\(d\\) 1.72 _dq_ (_J_ = 7.5, 6.5) and 0.99 \\(t\\) (_J_ = 7.26 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum were characteristic of a propyl moiety (Table 1). The 13C NMR data also supported the propyl skeleton (Table 2). The proton resonance at \\(d\\) 2.66, corresponding to a methylene group, was attributed to a sulfur-bearing carbon atom, which was confirmed by elemental analysis and interpretation of its mass spectrum. According to these data the structure of **1** was assigned as dippropyl disulphide, which is reported as a natural derivative in Phytolacaceae for the first time.\n\nCompounds **2**-**5** exhibited common features in their MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The presence of a significant ion peak at _m_/_z_ 91, which is characteristic of a benzyl fragment was observed in all mass spectra of these compounds. The benzyl portion appeared to bear one, two, three and four sulfur atoms, respectively, based on the elemental analyses. The 1H NMR spectra (Table 1) of **2**, **3**, **4** and **5** presented the same signal, around \\(d\\) 7.30, compatible with a monosubstituted aromatic ring. The major differences observed in the 1H NMR spectra of each compound was due to the chemical shift of the methylene benzylic hydrogens linked to the sulfur, which in compound **2** appeared at \\(d\\) 3.66; **3** at \\(d\\) 4.05; **4** at \\(d\\) 4.15 (De Souza et al., 1990) and **5** at \\(d\\) 4.19, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) of these compounds, interpreted with the aid of DEPT spectra, indicated the presence of one quaternary C and five CH's sp2 carbons attributable to an aromatic monosubstituted ring and one sp3 CH2 assigned to a benzylic carbon. The elemental analysis and HRMS data of compounds **2**-**5** firmly established the number (and amount) of sulfur atoms in these polysulphides and confirmed their identities as dibenzyl sulphide (**2**), dibenzyl disulphide (**3**), dibenzyl trisulphide (**4**) and dibenzyl tetrasulphide (**5**), respectively. Polysulphide **4** has previously been reported from this species (De Souza et al., 1990).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**6** had an hydroxymethyl group linked to the sulfur in place of the second benzylic group as in compound **2**. Interpretation of some HMBC data (Fig. 1) aided elucidation of this structure. Correlations observed between the methylene protons signal at \\(d\\) 5.03 with the benzylic carbon at \\(d\\) 44.27 and the methylene protons signal at \\(d\\) 3.60 with the carbons at \\(d\\) 78.50 and 127.42 established compound **6** as benzylhydroxymethyl monosulphide.\n\nPolysulphide **7** is closely comparable with dibenzyl trinsulphide **(4)**; comparison of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) data with those of **4** showed that the only differences observed were due to chemical shift of the benzylic hydrogens, which in **7** appeared at \\(d\\) 4.20 (_d_C = 43.19) and the presence of an additional singlet signal at \\(d\\) 5.30, which was attributed to methylene protons by the analysis inferred by COSY, HMQC and DEPT spectral data. Analysis of \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic data recorded a methylene benzylic carbon at \\(d\\) 43.19 and a second one, extremely unshielded at \\(d\\) 106.32, whose chemical shift could be explained by the stereo-eletronic effects of several sulfur atoms linked to methylene carbon. In fact, no correlations were observed in the spectra of the \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY and HMBC (Fig. 1) of the corresponding methylene protons with other protons or carbons, respectively in **7**. The elemental analysis, together with HRMS analysis established its molecular formula as C\\({}_{15}\\)H\\({}_{16}\\)S\\({}_{6}\\) and thus confirmed **7** to be di(benzyltrithio) methane.\n\nBioautography with the plant pathogenic fungi _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ was employed to guide fractionation and isolation of the polysulphides **1**-**7**, these being responsible for the fungicidal activity detected in the crude extract (Table 3). Similar or higher to the reference compound Nystatin, the polysulphides **1**-**4** showed potent inhibition, while compounds **5**-**7** showed marginal activity against fungal growth (10.0 > 25 and 5.0 mg, respectively), in both phytopathogenic strains tested. Furthermore, their potential anticancer activities were also tested, using a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka et al., 1994). Compounds **1**, **3** and **5** had moderate effect on DNA, as deduced by the selective inhibition of the mutant strains RS 321 and RS 52YK, relative to the wild strain RS 188N (Table 3).\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation\n\n\\({}^{1}\\)H NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer, using TMS as an int. standard. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR (50 or 75 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 and DPX-300 spectrometer. EI-MS were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/5988 A spectrometer and on a VG platform II spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer 2400. IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR 1750 Perkin Elmer and FT-IR 510 Nicolet. UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV/vis Hitachi U-3000.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe species _Petiveria alliacea_ L. was collected in September and October (1997) in the Instituto Butanta Reserve, in the city of Sao Paulo. Whole shrubs were collected and separated in their distinct parts: leaves, stems and roots. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botanica-SMA, under the number SP112.6.84.\n\n### Biological testing\n\nDNA-damaging assay with mutant yeast _S. cerevisiae_: Experimental screening methods utilizing mutant strains of _S. cerevisiae_ have been described elsewhere (Gunatilaka et al., 1992).

Ten microliters of the solutions of crude extracts, fractions and pure compounds were prepared, in different concentrations: corresponding to 20, 10, 1, 0.1 \\(\\mu\\)g for pure compounds and 100, 50, 30 and 20 \\(\\mu\\)g for the crude extracts or fractions, respectively. The samples were applied to TLC plates, these being eluted with the appropriate solvent system followed by complete removal of the solvent. The chromatographic plates were sprayed with spores suspension of _C. sphaerosospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ in a nutritive medium and incubated for 48 h at 37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. After incubation, clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background chromatogram.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nRoots, stems, and leaves of _P. allacea_ L. were dried at room temperature, powdered and extracted three times with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1, v/v), for two days, at room temperature. The resulting extracts were filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield 7.0, 8.0 and 15 g of root, stem and leaf extracts, respectively. Due to the higher bioactivity noted, half of the root extract was suspended in MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and _n_-butanol. After liquid/liquid partition, the resulting residue was concentrated in vacuo and extracted with H\\({}_{2}\\)O. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the hexane, CHCl\\({}_{3}\\), and EtoOAc solubles, using silica gel column chromatography and hexane, CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\), CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc and CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (with increasing polarity) as eluants, afforded several fractions, whose bioactivities were detected only in six of them. The first hexane fraction was applied to a Si gel column tilting with a hexane:CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) gradient to afford compound **1** (22 mg). The fractions eluted with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc were further subjected to silica gel column chromatography using a MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O gradient. The intermediary fractions of this column, purified by HPLC using a C-18 Econosil column, 5 mm, 250\\(\\times\\)4 mm i.d., with an elution gradient of MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (70:30) 7 min; MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (90:10) 15 min. and MeOH (100%) 20 min with flow rate of 1 ml/min yielded the compounds **2** (7.8 mg), **3** (4.5 mg), **4** (15.0 mg) and **5** (3.6 mg). The EtOAc soluble fraction, was subjected to Si gel column chromatography using CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc with increasing polarity. The fractions obtained with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc (7:3) afforded **6** (3.8 mg).

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of _Piper arboreum_ yielded two new amides, _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**1**), arboreumine (**2**) together with the known compounds _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_)-pentaenosyl]-pyrrolidine (**3**) and _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_), 9(_E_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**4**). Catalytic hydrogenation of **3** yielded the amide _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]-pyrrolidine (**5**). We also have isolated six amides (**6-11**) and two antifungal cinnamoxyl derivatives (**12, **13**) from seeds and leaves of _Piper tuberculatum_. Compounds **1**-**11** showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against _Cladosporium phaerosospermum_ while compounds **3-4** and **6-13** also showed antifungal activity against _C. cladosporioides_. (c) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.\n\n_Keywords: Piper arboreum; Piper tuberculatum_; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity\n\n+\nFootnote †: journal: Physica A\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nChemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, ligands and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996; Parmar et al, 1997; Alecio et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides _N_-[7-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_),4(_Z_)-heptadienoyl]pyrrolidine, (32,_S_Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of _Piper hspidium_ H. B. K. (Alecio et al., 1998) and 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxyscinnamoyl)-\\(\\Delta^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one from _Piper tuberculatum_ Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**1**), arboreumine (**2**) and nine **(3-11)** known antifungal amides _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_)-pentaenosyl]-pyrrolidinine (**3**), its derivative _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]-pyrrolidine (**5**) and _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_E_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**4**); besides pedilirine (**6**), \\(\\Delta^{\\text{a}\\text{b}}\\)-dihydropierine (**7**), piperidine (**8**), dihydropierine (**9**), _cis_-pieridine (or 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13, 14-trimethoxyscinnamoyl)-\\(\\Delta^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one) (**10**) and fagaramide (**11**). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxyscinnamate (**12**) and methyl _trans_-6,7,8-trimethoxyscinnamate (**13**). The amides isolated from leaves of _Piper arboreum_ (**1**-**4**) and the hydrogenated derivative of **3 (**5**)** were active against the fungus _Cladosporium phaerosospermum_, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of _Piper tuberculatum_ **3, 4** and 6**-**13**\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n(Navickiene et al., 2000) were also active against the fungi _Cladosporium sphaerospermann_ and _C. cladosporioides_, as evaluated by direct bioautography (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n_N_-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoil]-pyrrolidine (**1**) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm-1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at \\(d\\) 5.93 (2H, _s_), and four olefinic protons which showed signals at \\(d\\) 6.29 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)7,8 = 14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)8,7 = 14.3 and \\(J\\)8,9 = 10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)9,8 = 10.9 and \\(J\\)9,10 = 11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)10,9 = 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the \\(E\\) and \\(Z\\) geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the \\(E\\) and \\(Z\\) configurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of _trans-trans_ configuration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assignment of the _cis_ configuration for the g,d double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at \\(d\\) 3.52 (2H, _m_) and \\(d\\) 1.90 (2H, m) attributed to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of **1** were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-field region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at \\(d\\) 164.8, 10 sp2 carbons, four sp3 carbons [_d_C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at \\(d\\) 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Araujo-Junior et al., 1997; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000).\n\nArboreumine (**2**) was shown to have the molecular formula C23H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES-MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm-1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respectively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at \\(d\\) 2.15 (2H, \\(J\\)2a,2b - _?a,2b = 17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, \\(J\\)2b,2a -?b,2a = 17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H-2'a and H-2b, H-2'b which are characteristic of methylene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-9', at \\(d\\) 4.29 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\)10,9 - _?,8' = 5.0 Hz and \\(J\\)10,11 - _?,10' = 6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at \\(d\\) 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at \\(d\\) 1.20 (_J_11,10 - _?,9' = 6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-11'; H-13, H-12'; H-14, H-13' and H-11, H-10', respectively. The signal at \\(d\\) 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as confirmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-5'; H-8, H-7' and H-9, H-8' showed signals at \\(d\\) 5.81 (_q_, \\(J\\)6,12 - _?,11' = 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (_dd_, \\(J\\)8,9 -?,8' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)8,12 - _?,11' = 1.0 Hz) and 5.76 (_dd_, \\(J\\)9,8 -?,7' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)9,10 - _?,9' = 5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further confirmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spectrum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-7'; H-9, H-8' and H-10, H-9' was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.76 assigned to H-9, H-8' (_J_9,8 -?,7 = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)9,10 - _?,9' = 5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-7' (_J_8,9 -?,8' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)8,12 -?,11' = 1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at \\(d\\) 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-9' (_J_10,9 -?,8' = 5.0 Hz and \\(J\\)10,11 -?,10' = 6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at \\(d\\) 1.20 assigned to H-11, H-10' (_J_11,10 -?,9' = 6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at \\(d\\) 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-2'a (_J_2a,2b -?a,2b = 17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at \\(d\\) 2.37 assigned to H-2b, H-2'b (_J_2b,2a -?b,2a = 17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spectral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum. The carbon signals at \\(d\\) 49.5 and 40.9\n\n## Page 4\n\nassigned to C-2, C-2' and C-3, C-3', respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at \\(\\delta\\) 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the carbon (C-3 and C-3'), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at \\(\\delta\\) 198.3 and the 3H singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 0.95 (C-14 and C-13') indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3' was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-2'a and H-2b, H-2'b (\\(\\delta\\) 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3' (\\(\\delta\\) 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-12' and C-14, C-13' and H-14, H-13' and C-13, C-12' were also observed. The carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 163.9 (C-5, C-4'), 126.1 (C-6, C-5') and 40.9 (C-3, C-3') showed a correlation with the 1H singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 2.15 (H-2a, H-2'a), corroborating the adjacent relationship between the amide group and C-2, C-2'. The carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 67.3 (C-10, C-9') and 135.6 (C-9, C-8') showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-10' adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,t-unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambiguously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 11' with the carbon signals \\(\\delta\\) 126.1 (C-6, C-5') and 128.6 (C-8, C-7'), whereas the quadruplet at \\(\\delta\\) 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-5' (\\(J_{6,12-5,11'}\\)= 1.0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-7'). Finally, HETCOR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide **2** was determined as depicted.\n\nThe CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of _P. tuberculatum_ were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\) containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to afford compounds **6-13**. Pellitorine (**6**) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further purification, and it was identified by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data previously described by Rosario et al., 1996. d\\({}^{\\Delta,\\mathrm{b}}\\)dihydro piperine (**7**) and dihydropiplartine (**9**) had their \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra published for the same compounds previously isolated from _ Piper rugosum_ (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and _ Piper guineense_ (Parmar et al., 1997) and their \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (**8**) was isolated from seeds and leaves, and the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). _Cis_-piplartine (**10**) had its \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (**11**) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl _trans_-6,7,8-tri-methoxycinnamate (**13**) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectroscopic data were similar to that obtained in this work.\n\nThe antifungal activity of compounds **1-13** was determined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds **1-13** (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for _C. sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered.\n\nThe minimum amount of compounds **3-4**; **2** and **5**; and **1** required to inhibit growth of the fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds **3** and **4** showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the standards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against _C. cladosporioides_, the amide **4** being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds **6-10**, **13** and **11**, **12** the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus _C. cladosporioides_ on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for **6-10** and **13** indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from _P. arboreum_ are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l r} \\hline Position & **2** & \\\\ \\hline  & \\({}^{1}\\)H \\(\\delta\\) [\\(m\\), \\(J\\) (Hz), 500 MHz] & \\({}^{13}\\)C \\(\\delta\\)a  \\\\  & & (125 MHz) \\\\ \\hline\n1, 1′ & 2.80 (1H, \\(s\\)) & – \\\\\n2a, 2′a & 2.15 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{2a,2b,2b-2a,2b}\\)= 17.0) & 49.5 (_t_) \\\\\n2b, 2b & 2.37 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{2a,2b,2a-2b,2a}\\)= 17.0) & \\\\\n3, 3′ & – & 40.9 (_s_) \\\\\n4 & – & 198.3 (_s_) \\\\\n5, 4′ & – & 163.9 (_s_) \\\\\n6, 5′ & 5.81 (1H, \\(q\\), \\(J_{6,12-5,11'}\\)= 1.0) & 126.1 (_d_) \\\\\n7, 6′ & – & b \\\\\n8, 7′ & 5.70 (1H, \\(dd\\), \\(J_{8,9\n\n## Page 5\n\npiperidine, dihydropyridone and isobutyl amides from _P. tuberculatum_. It is important to note that the inhibition of _C. sphaerospermann_ by dihydropyridone amide **9** appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of _C. cladosporioides_ was lower than the standards (Table 4).\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2x250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), flow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were performed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Piper arboreum_ H. B. K. leaves were collected in Aranaquara--SP, Brazil and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias--USP, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil.\n\n_Piper tuberculatum_ Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA--Manaus, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru).

For the antifungal assay--10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds **1-5** and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds **6-13**, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of _C. sphaerospermann_ or _C. cladosporioides_ in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 degC. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of **1-5** and **6-13** required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and microazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nA CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of _P. arboreum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides **1-4**.\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves of _P. arboreum_ (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and conc. in vacuo to afford 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively. The resulting CH2Cl2 soluble\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compound & Antifungal activity a (μg) \\\\\n**3** & 0.1 \\\\\n**4** & 0.1 \\\\\n**6** & 5.0 \\\\\n**7** & 5.0 \\\\\n**8** & 5.0 \\\\\n**9** & 5.0 \\\\\n**10** & 5.0 \\\\\n**11** & 10.0 \\\\\n**12** & 10.0 \\\\\n**13** & 5.0 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Antifungal activity of compounds **6–13** against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compound & Antifungal activity a (μg) \\\\\n**1** & 10.0 \\\\\n**2** & 5.0 \\\\\n**3** & 0.1 \\\\\n**4** & 0.1 \\\\\n**5** & 5.0 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Antifungal activity of amides **1–5** against _Cladosporium sphaerospermann_\n\n## Page 6\n\npart (54.8 g) were applied to a silica gel column (300.0 g), and eluted with CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) containing increasing amounts of MeOH (up to 100%) to give 30 fractions.

The genus _Casearia_, with about 1000 described species [4], has not been subjected to extensive investigations [5-9]. _C. sylvestris_ is reported to be a source of casearins, diterpenes known to have cytotoxic activity against V-79 cells [9-11]. Bioactivity-directed fractionation of an extract of leaves of _C. sylvestris_, collected in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, led to the isolation of the known clerodane diterpene, casearin G (**1**), and the two new clerodane diterpenes, casearin S (**2**) and T (**3**), as the main components responsible for the DNA-damaging activity of this extract. This is the first report of the DNA-modifying activity of clerodane diterpenes.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nA preliminary investigation of the bioactive CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of _C. sylvestris_ indicated that its bioactivity was due to diterpene components. The resulting fractions exhibiting bioactivity were further separated by silica gel CC and prep. TLC to afford five bioactive fractions containing oxygenated diterpenes as their main constituents. A small amount of each fraction was acetylated in order to improve the process of purification and also to assure that the acetylated products maintained their bioactivities. As the acetylated fractions remained active, the non-acetylated mixtures were subjected to acetylation followed by the usual purification to yield three acetylated bioactive clerodane diterpenes, named casearins G, S and T. Casearin G (**1**) is a known compound previously isolated from the same source [11], while casearins S (**2**) and T (**3**) are new bioactive diterpenes. Their structures were confirmed by extensive spectroscopic studies and comparison of their spectra with those in the literature for related casearins [8-11].\n\nCasearin S (**2**), C27H38O7 (EIMS), [a]D0 +-18.0deg, exhibited 1H and 13C NMR spectral data very similar to those observed for casearin G [11] (Tables 1 and 2). However, the triplet attributed to H-18 at d\n\n## Page 2\n\n6.67 (\\(J\\) = 1.5 Hz) in the low field region of the 1H NMR spectrum of **1** was absent in diterpene **2**. The other signals attributed to H-2, H-7, H-12, H-14, H-15 and H-19 were almost superimposable, when compared with **1**, indicating that the only modification in the structure of **2** was related to C-18. In fact, the 13C NMR spectrum of **2** (Table 2) resembled that of casearin G, with the major differences being due to the lack of the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 94.5 (d) attributed to C-18, and the presence of an additional signal at \\(\\delta\\) 172.6 (s), typical of a lactone carbonyl function. Analysis of the 1H NMR spectral data showed that the signal of H-3 resonates at \\(\\delta\\) 6.79 (br s), while this proton in compound **1** resonates at \\(\\delta\\) 5.99 (br s). The only explanation of this chemical shift difference (D_d_ 0.81) observed for H-3 must be that the hemiacetal function at C-18 in **1** is converted to a carbonyl group in **2**. The presence of only one acetyl and one butunayly group in **2** was also confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2). The locations of the acetyl moieties were defined by 1H-13C long-range COLOC spectra. The hydrogen linked to the C-19 methine showed a correlation with the C-18 carbonyl carbon of the lactone ring (\\(\\delta\\) 172.6). The modification of the chemical shift values in the 13C NMR spectrum of C-3 and C-4 (\\(\\delta\\) 132.4 and 142.0, respectively) corroborated the assignment of the carbonyl function to C-18 [12]. As the position and configuration of the methoxy group of the casearin analogue compounds were determined in C-2 by INADEQUATE spectra [10] and X-ray analysis [10], the butanoyl group was defined as linked to C-7, although no correlation was observed in long-range spectra between H-7 and the carbonyl of the butanoyl group. The equatorial orientation of the butanoyl function at C-7 was inferred by considering the coupling constants observed for H-7 in **2** and comparison with those of casearin G. The relative configuration of the stereogenic carbon C-2 in **2** was assigned on the basis of 1H-1H COSY spectra and comparison of these data with those reported for casearin analogues [11].\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} H & **1**[lit.10] & **2** & **3** \\\\\n2 & 3.86 br s & 3.85 br s & 3.88 br s \\\\\n3 & 5.99 br s & 6.79 br s & 6.02 br s \\\\\n6 & & 5.37 d (4.7) \\\\\n7 & 4.90 d (4.7; 11.6) & 4.98 d (4.5; 11.5\n\n## Page 3\n\nCaserarin T (**3**) was obtained as a colorless oil after acetylation. This diterpene also showed 1H and 13C NMR spectral characteristics similar to other casearins [8-12]. Compound **3** has a marked structural resemblance to casearins B, P and Q, due the presence of a acetyl group at C-6 [8,10]. The spectral data (Tables 1 and 2) obtained for **3** were consistent with the structural features of casearins, usually characterized by methoxy, acetoxy and butanoylay moieties. In the case of **3**, the 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) were compatible with the structure proposed for this diterpene. One methoxy function at C-2, three acetoxy groups at C-18, C-19, C-6, and one butanoyloxy group at C-7 were assigned by analysis of 1H-13C long-range COLOC correlations. Again, the correlation between H-7 and the carbonyl of the butanoyl group was not observed. However, correlations of H-6, H-18 and H-19 with carbonyl groups at \\(d\\) 170.2, 170.4 and 170.0 respectively, attributed to acetoxy functions linked to the corresponding carbons, provided clear evidence for the location of these groups and consequently for the structure of **3**. Further, the proton signal of H-6 (_d_ 5.37) in **3** was coupled with H-7 (_d_ 5.17) by 4.7 Hz, completely different for C-6 (_d_ 5.19, \\(J\\) = 10.6 Hz) in casearins B and Q [10,11]. Since the acetoxy groups in these latter compounds are in equatorial positions, the acetoxyl function in **3** must be \\(b\\) and axial. Further evidence for the _b_-disposition of the functional group at C-6 in **3** was provided by the chemical shift value of C-8 at \\(d\\) 37.1, shielded by 2 ppm in relation to casearins B and Q [9,10].\n\nThe biological activity data for diterpenes **1-3** in the mechanism-based yeast mutant bioassay are given in Table 3. All three diterpenoid compounds showed selective activity in the Rad 52Y and RS 321 assay compared with the wild type Rad + strain [13].\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nSilica gel (Merck, 230-400 and 70-230 Mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated, and solvents were relistilled prior to use. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer at 200 MHz with TMS as internal standard. 13C NMR and 2D NMR were performed at 50 MHz with TMS as internal standard. Mass spectra were taken on a Platform II spectrometer. Optical activities were measured on a Carl Zeiss Jena Polamat A. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe aerial parts of _Casearia sylvestris_**SW** (Flacourtiaceae) were collected at the Florestal Reserve at Martinho Prado (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) in October 1994. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Bioassay\n\nIdentical to those reported in Ref. [13].\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves of _C. sylvestris_ (3.5 kg) were sequentially extracted with cold _n_-hexane and a mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1, v/v). The latter extract (13.5 g) was subjected to gel filtration with elution by _n_-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOHAc and MeOH. The bioactive CH2Cl2 fraction was concentrated _in vacuo_ to afford a brown gum (1.2 g),\n\n## Page 4\n\nwhich was subjected to Si gel CC (40 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amount of EtOAc to give 33 fractions. Fraction F-17 (50 mg) after acetylation [50 mg on 0.2 mL Py, 0.3 mL Ac2O, overnight] was separated by Prep TLC, using EtOAc:Hex (8.5:1.5) as solvent. This step afford three main fractions (17A-17C); fraction 17A consisted of caesarin G (1) (9.0 mg). The fraction F-19 (113 mg) was separated by a silica gel column, eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (9:1), yielding impure caesarin S (2) (26 mg). Rechromatography on Si gel Prep TLC eluted with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) yielded pure caesarin S (5.2 mg). F-22 (213 mg) was also submitted to acetylation [213 mg on 1 mL Py, 1.5 mL Ac2O, overnight] and the acetylated mixture was subjected to Si gel CC (230-400 Mesh) (25 g), eluted with increasing amounts of EtOAc in hexane to give 20 fractions. Fraction 19 was applied to a Si gel column, eluted with hexane with increasing amounts of EtOAc to give five fractions. F-19-2 (12.0 mg) was chromatographed on Si gel Prep TLC, eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (8:2) to give casein-arin T (3) (4.8 mg).\n\n#### _Caserin G (1)_\n\nColorless oil [a]D + 28.5deg (_c_ 0.25, CHCl3,), lit.

Pinheiro Ferreira, Andre G. Santos, Aristeu G. Tininis, Patricia M. Costa, Alberto J. Cavalheiro, Vanderlan S. Bolzani, Manoel O. Moraes, Leticia V. Costa-Lotufo, Raquel C. Montenegro, Claudia Pessoa\n\n# Abstract\n\nClerodane diterpenes have demonstrated cytotoxic; antiplasmodial and anti-ulcer properties. In the present work, we determined the cytotoxic effect of casearin L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (--)-hardwickic acid isolated from _Casearin sylvestris_ leaves, and investigated the underlying mechanisms involved in _in vitro_ cell death induced by Cas X in HL-60 leukemia cells (0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 mM). Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that Cas X was the most active compound studied, showing greater cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 lines (Isc\\({}_{50}\\) of 0.4 mM) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, Isc\\({}_{50}\\) of 1.2 mM). After 24th exposure, Cas X caused a decrease in 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (36.6 and 24.5% labeling at 0.7 and 1.5 mM, respectively), reduction in viability, and increase in apoptotic and necrotic leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner evidenced by the trypan blue and _A_O/EB (acridine orange/ethidium bromide) assays. Moreover, Cas X-treated cells exhibited nuclear fragmentation and cytoplasmic vacuolization depending on the concentration tested. These characteristics of apoptosis or secondary necrosis were confirmed by flow cytometry which revealed DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, activation of the effector caspases 3/7 and mitochondrial depolarization. We then found evidence that Cas X causes cell death via apoptotic pathways, corroborating the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCancer is a pathological consequence with multifactorial causes such as mutations in specific genes (proto-oncogenes/tumor suppressors) or post-translational modifications of proteins, where key events can increase cancer risk and lead to uncontrolled proliferation [1]. Chemotherapy remains the most important line of defense for patients with hematological malignancies and aggressive forms of solid tumors. However, drug toxicity and efficacy vary widely among these patients [2]. Many drugs normally kill cancer cells by inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, two forms of cell death with distinct morphological and biochemical features [3-5]. In this scenario, plant compounds have made valuable contributions to the discovery of new naturally occurring anticancer agents, especially those from tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world [6].\n\n#### Casearia sylvestris\n\nSwartz (Salicaceae), a medicinal tree that grows practically throughout the entire Brazilian territory from Amazonas State (Tapajos River region) to Rio Grande do Sul State [7,8], is popularly known as \"guacatonga,\" \"cafezinho-do-mato,\" \"cafe-Silvestre\" and \"erva-de-bugre.\" Its leaves are used for treating traumas, for skin and oral wound healing and as a topical anesthetic and antiseptic [7,9]. _In vitro_ and pre-clinical studies have highlighted its anti-inflammatory [10-12], antimicrobial [13-15], antiplasmodial [16], and anti-ulcer [11,17,18] properties.\n\nPhytochemical investigations of _C. sylvestris_ leaf extracts have led to the discovery of bioactive clerodanes, the casearins and casearvestrins, which are oxygenated tricyclic diterpenes with excellent cytotoxic and antitumor potential [14,19,20-22]. Despite their well-known antiproliferative actions, there are no studies showing how these diterpenes cause cell death, although Huang et al. [23] have suggested that clerodane diterpenes isolated from _Casearia membranacea_ induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells (human prostate tumor line).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nIn this work, we determined the cytotoxic activity of clerodane diterpenes [casearins L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (-)-hardwickiic acid isolated from C. _sylvestris_ leaves and investigated the cytotoxic effects of Cas X on HL-60 leukemia cells and the underlying mechanisms involved in its _in vitro_ cytotoxic action.\n\n## Material and methods\n\n### Plant material and structure determination\n\nLeaves of _C. sylvestris_ were collected at the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (Sao Miguel Arcanjo, Sao Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium 'Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann' (Instituto Botanico do Estado de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identified by Dr. lines Cordiero (Instituto Botanico do Estado de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of _C. sylvestris_ were extracted with ethanol in a stainless steel extractor with solvent teruka for ca. 24 h at 40 degC. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) and dried in desiccators over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield a dry residue.\n\nThe structure of the compounds caearins L, O, X and (-)-hardwickiic acid was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in Santos et al. [21] and Santos et al. [22].\n\n### Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes [(Cas L, Cas O, Cas X and (-)-hardwickiic acid)] was evaluated by the MTT assay [24] against 3 human leukemia cell lines: HL-60, K-562 and GEM, all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, at 37 degC with 5% CO2. By an indirect way, tumor cell proliferation was quantified through the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product [24]. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates and diterpenes (0.01-10 uM) were added to wells. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT 10%. Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 uLDMSO and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX 880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin (Dox, Sigma Aldrich) was used as a positive control (0.02-8.6 uM).\n\nTo avoid false proliferation data, the experiments were performed in triplicate and the proliferation rate was always compared to negative controls. In all replicates, similar inhibition rates and cell proliferation in negative control wells were higher than in the treated wells.\n\n### Alamar Blue assay\n\nIn order to investigate the selectivity of Cas X for normal proliferating cells, the Alamar Blue(tm) assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug exposure. All studies were performed in accordance with Brazilian research guidelines (Law 196/96, National Council of Health).\n\nHeparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug for at least 15 days prior to sampling, aged between 18 and 30 years old) was collected, and PBMC were isolated by a standard method of density-gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 3 x 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 u/mL streptomycin at 37 degC with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (4%) was added at the beginning of culture, according to Cavancanti et al. [25] with some modifications. PBMC were then plated in 96-well plates (3 x 105 cells/well in 100 uL of medium). After 24 h, the test compound (0.01-10 uM) dissolved in 1% DMSO was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for another 72 h. Dox (0.02-8.6 uM) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incubation, 10 uL of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma Aldrich Co) were added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiple reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter(r)), and the drug effect was quantified as the percentage of control absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of medium only is also measured at the higher and lower wavelengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOHW. A correction factor R0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOHW, where \\(R\\)0 = AOHW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced is then expressed as follows: % Reduced = _A_LW - (_A_HW \\(R\\)0) x 100.\n\n### Evaluation of mechanism involved in leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity\n\nThe following experiments were performed in order to investigate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect of Cas X. The doses were chosen based on IC50 values of Cas X in HL-60 cells after 24-h exposure. Cas X dissolved in sterile DMSO was added to HL-60 cell cultures (0.3 x 106 cells/mL) to obtain final concentrations of 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 uM (IC50/2, IC50 and 2 x IC50, respectively). Dox, 0.6 uM, was used as a positive control.\n\n#### Trypan blue exclusion\n\nCell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay [26]. Aliquots from each well were removed from cultures after 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber.\n\n#### Inhibition of DNA synthesis\n\nHL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with Cas X. Before the end of drug exposure, 20 uL of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) were added to each well and the cells incubated for another 3 h at 37 degC. To determine the amount of BrdU incorporated into DNA, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature [27]. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and coverslipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was performed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per slide to determine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells.\n\n#### Staining with hematoxylin-eosin\n\nUntreated or Cas X-treated HL-60 cells were examined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metrimpex Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar Lab(r)). To evaluate morphology, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, fixed with methanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H8E, Sigma Aldrich Co. - St. Louis, MO/USA).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n#### 2.4.4 Morphological analysis using fluorescence microscopy\n\nAcridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining of HL-60 cells was performed to determine the cell death pattern induced by increasing concentrations of Cas X. Although AO and EB are DNA intercalating molecules, the first is able to cross intact membranes and confers green appearance to the nucleus of viable cells. On the other hand, EB is incorporated mainly by non-viable cells or in the presence of membrane instability, staining nucleus in red [28]. So, after 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted, and each sample was mixed with 1 mL of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 mg/mL of AO in PBS; 100 mg/mL EB in PBS) just prior to fluorescence microscopy analysis and quantification (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hundred cells were counted per sample and scored as follows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells [29].\n\n#### 2.4.5 Flow cytometry analysis\n\nAll flow cytometry analyses were performed in a Guava EasyCytre Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cell debris was omitted from the analysis.\n\n##### 2.4.5.1 Cell membrane integrity\n\nCell membrane integrity was evaluated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich Co. - St. Louis, MO/USA). Briefly, 100 mL of treated and untreated cells were incubated with propidium iodide (50 mg/mL). The cells were then incubated for 5 min. Fluorescence was measured and cell morphology, granularity and membrane integrity were determined [30].\n\n##### 2.4.5.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation\n\nInternucleosomal DNA fragmentation was evaluated by the incorporation of propidium iodide (50 mg/mL). Briefly, HL-60 cells were treated and then incubated at 25 degC for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 mg/mL propidium iodide. Fluorescence was measured and DNA fragmentation was analyzed [31].\n\n##### 2.4.5.3. Measurement of mitochondrial transmembrane potential\n\nMitochondrial depolarization was evaluated by incorporation of rhodamine 123 (Sigma Aldrich Co. - St. Louis, MO/USA). Rhodamine 123 is a cell-permeable, cationic, fluorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria without inducing cytotoxic effects. Briefly, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 mL of 1 mg/mL rhodamine 123 for 15 min in the dark. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Fluorescence was measured and percentage mitochondrial depolarization was determined [29].\n\n##### 2.4.5.4. Phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization\n\nPS externalization was demonstrated by flow cytometry after PS staining with annexin V according to the method described by Vermes et al. [32]. Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in 135 mL of PBS with 5 mL of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and 10 mL of annexin V-PE (Guava Nexin Assay Kit). The cells were gently vortexed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (20-25 degC) in the dark. Afterward, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (EasyCytre from Guava Technologies). Annexin V is a phospholipid-binding protein that has a high affinity for PS. 7-AAD, a cell impermeant dye, is used as an indicator of membrane structural integrity. Fluorescence of annexin V-PE was measured at 583 nm (yellow fluorescence) and 7-AAD at 680 nm (red fluorescence). The percentages of early and late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells were then calculated.\n\n##### 2.4.5.5. Detection of caspases 3 and 7\n\nCaspase 3/7 activity was estimated by flow cytometry, using the Guava EasyCytre Caspase Kit, after 24 h of incubation. HL-60 cells (3 x 105 cells/mL) were incubated with Fluorescent Labeled Inhibitor of Caspases (FLICA) and maintained for 1 h at 37 degC and 5% CO2. After incubation, 80 mL of washing buffer were added and cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 mL of washing buffer and centrifuged again. The cells were then resuspended in the working solution (propidium iodide 1:200 in 1x washing buffer) and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nFor cytotoxicity studies, the IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). In order to determine differences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman-Keuls test (_p_ < 0.01).\n\n## Results\n\n### Cytotoxicity against tumor and normal cells\n\nCytotoxicity analyses by MTT after 72 h of incubation displayed that Cas X was the most active clerodane diterpene (Table 1), showing higher cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 cells with IC50 values of 0.4 mM for both cell lines. Interestingly, K-562 cells were more resistant to Cas X, displaying an IC50 of 9 mM. On the other hand, caesarins L and O were moderately cytotoxic while (-)-hardwickiic acid was ineffective in inhibiting cell proliferation. PBMC assay showed IC50 values of 1.2 (1.0-1.4) mM and 1.5 (1.1-2.0) mM for Cas X and Dox, respectively.\n\nAll following experiments were performed with HL-60 cells to investigate the mechanism of action of Cas X.\n\n### Cell viability, DNA synthesis and morphological changes\n\nHL-60 cells treated with Cas X had significantly reduced cell viability and increased number of non-viable cells (_p_ < 0.01), showing a dose-dependent effect after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1A).\n\nAiming to understand the antiproliferative effect of Cas X, BrdU incorporation into the DNA was measured. All experiments were performed in three concentrations (0.7, 1.5 and 3 mM), but the highest one did not allow a confident cell analysis after treatment,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} Cell line & Compound − IC50 μM/mL (μM)a \\\\ (−)-Hardwickiic acid & Casearin L & Casearin O & Casearin X & Doxorbitcin \\\\ (−) & 55(15.5) & 2.7 (5.2).2–1.3–4. & 2.6 (4.3).2–3.0 & 0.2 (0.4).0–2.0–3.0 & 0.02 (0.04).0–0.02–0.03 \\\\ HL-60 & 35(15.5) & >5 (15.5) & 3.3 (5.6).2–6.42 & 0.2 (0.4).0–1.0–2.0 & 0.02 (0.04).01–0.02 \\\\ K-562 & >5(15.5) & 2.5 (4.8).1–1.5–5. & 3.0 (5.1).2–4.2 & 4.8 (9.0).2–6.8–7.0 & 0.14 (0.24).09–0.23 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Cytotoxicity activity of clerodane diterpenes on human leukemia cell lines after 72 h of exposure evaluated by MTT assay.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nprobably because the concentration of 3uM is too higher, leading to destabilization of the plasma membrane and severe cell destruction, interfering in the morphological examination required by the method [33]. As seen in Fig. 1B, Cas X led to decreasing BrdU incorporation, with 36.6 and 24.5% labeling in relation to control at 0.7 and 1.5 uM, respectively (_p_ < 0.01), while Dox (0.6 uM) led to 26.5% BrdU labeling.\n\nTo establish whether the growth inhibition displayed by Cas X was related to the induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/EB staining by fluorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment, there was a reduction in the number of viable cells in a dose-dependent manner, while apoptotic and necrotic cells increased (_p_ < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was observed at the lower doses of 0.7 and 1.5 uM (82 and 88.1%, respectively), while at the highest dose, 3.0 uM, necrosis was the main cell death pattern (77.7%).\n\nTreated and untreated cells were examined under light microscopy following H/E staining. Control cells exhibited a typical non-adherent, round morphology with vacuolization (Fig. 2A), while Cas X-treated cells displayed a gradual chromatin condensation and fragmentation, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, cell shrinking and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C-E), especially at 1.5 uM (Fig. 2E). Dox (0.6 uM) induced a reduction in cell volume, along with nuclear disintegration and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B).\n\n### Mechanism of action underlying Cas X cytotoxicity - flow cytometry analysis\n\n#### Membrane disruption\n\nCas X induced plasma membrane disruption in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner (_p_ < 0.01, Fig. 3A), whereas at 1.5 uM (5.8%) and 3.0 uM, 24.6% of the cells showed membrane lysis when compared to untreated cells (1.4%). Doxorubicin, positive control, also caused membrane disruption (7.4%).\n\n#### Mithochondrial DNA fragmentation\n\nMitochondrial depolarization is a feature of apoptosis. HL-60 treated cells (Fig. 3C) showed mitochondrial depolarization at all concentrations tested: 23.2, 68.8 and 21.8%, for 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 uM, respectively. It is important to note that at the highest concentration (3.0 uM) a false mitochondrial repolarization occurred, which can be explained by severe cell destruction [33].\n\n#### Mithochondrial depolarization\n\nCaspase 3/7 activation was found with all concentrations tested (Fig. 3D). Early apoptotic cells were observed with 3.0 uM Cas X (17.3%). Meanwhile, an increase in late apoptosis (13.3, 27.7 and 10.8%) and necrosis (6.4, 6.9 and 6.1%) was observed in cells treated with 1.5 uM and 3.0 uM Cas X and Dox, respectively (_p_ < 0.01). No differences were observed at the lowest concentration of Cas X (0.7 uM).\n\n#### Mithophatidylserine externalization\n\nPhosphatidylserine (PS) detection is a hallmark of apoptosis; PS resides on the surface of the plasma membrane, where cell damage leads to its externalization [32]. Cells treated with Cas X at all concentrations displayed PS externalization (_p_ < 0.01, Fig. 4). The number of early apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner [10.1, 18.4 and 38.4% for cells treated with Cas X at 0.7 (Fig. 4C), 1.5 (Fig. 4D) and 3.0 uM (Fig. 4E), respectively]. Meanwhile, late apoptosis was more frequent at 1.5 and 3.0 uM (17.8 and 39.6%, respectively).\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\nDrug discovery from medicinal plants has played an important role in cancer chemotherapy. Of all the available anticancer drugs between 1940 and 2002, 40% were natural products _per_ se or natural product-derived [34,35]. Nevertheless, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, either because of undesired side effects or multi-drug resistance [2]. Therefore, it is very important to find new compounds with antineoplastic activity with more specificity against cancer cells and thus fewer side effects. In this way, _Casearia_ species have a wide range of biological activities [11,24,36,37] that make it a probable source of new active compounds with anticancer properties. In the present work, the cytotoxic effect of the clerodane diterpenes (-)-hardwickiic acid and casearins L, O and X isolated\n\nFig. 1: Effects of Caesarin X (Cas X 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 μM) on HL-60 leukemia cells after 24 h of incubation. A – Viability determined by trypan blue staining; B – BrdU (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) incorporation; C – Cell death pattern determined by acridine orange and ethidium bromide-staining (AO/EB). Negative control (C) was treated with the vehicle used for diluting the tested substance. Doxorubicin (0.6 μM) was used as positive control (D). Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of measurement (S.E.M) from three independent experiments; \\(p\\) < 0.01 compared to control by ANOVA followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nfrom _C. sylvestris_ leaves was determined in three leukemia lines (CEM, HL-60 and K-562). Also, the cytotoxicity of Cas X was investigated in normal PBM proliferating cells. The underlying mechanism of action of Cas X was further evaluated using the HL-60 cell line as a model [33,38].\n\nMTT assays showed that all compounds tested were active against at least one cell line, where Cas X was the most active against HL-60 and CEM cell lines. PBMC were also sensitive to Cas X but 3-fold less than the leukemia cells. Only (-)-hardwickiic acid showed no cytotoxicity against the leukemia cell lines. Several authors have demonstrated that clerodane diterpenes, secondary metabolites present in _Casearia_ species, are cytotoxic to different tumor cell lines, such as colon (HCT-116), leukemia (HL-60), ovarian (A2780), prostate (PC-3), and normal fibroblasts (L-929, V-79) [14,22,37,39,40,41]. More recently, we demonstrated the cytotoxic capacity of the Cas X against leukemia (MOLT-4, IC50 value of 0.22 mM), melanoma (MDA/MB-435, 0.35 mM), nervous system (SF-295, 0.43 mM), and colon (HCT-8, 0.97 mM) cancer cells [22]. Concerning chemotherapeutic potential, it is important to determine if the compound shows harmful effects in normal dividing cells such as proliferating leukocytes [42]. Herein, the data institute a narrow selectivity of Cas X towards cancer cells, though we previously showed that Cas X was up to 12-fold more selective against adherent cancer lines when compared to normal fibroblasts [22].\n\nStructural comparison of known casearins revealed that the main differences in activity involve substitutions at C-2, C-6, C-7, C-18 and C-19. Replacement of the acyl group at C-6 markedly decreases activity of the derivatives, indicating that the bulkiness at that site is important for biological activity [20]. Cytotoxic effects of casein L, O and X seem to depend on the ring structure formed by carbons C-18 and C-19, since acid hydrolysis and opening of this ring leads to molecular instability and loss of bioactivity [37] as seen with (-)-hardwickiic acid, which does not inhibit cell proliferation (Fig. 5). Moreover, (-)-hardwickiic acid was one of the first differences reported in \\(C\\) sylvestris without the typical highly oxygenated backbone [21]. Many of the clerodanes that are highly oxygenated exhibit effective insect antifeedant, antibacterial, cytotoxic and antifungal properties [14,41,43].\n\nThe antiproliferative effects of Cas X in leukemia cells were confirmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, BrdU incorporation and flow cytometry. Furthermore, morphological analysis using HE and AO/BE staining after 24 h of incubation revealed that treated cells displayed typical apoptotic and necrotic features, including signs\n\nFig. 2: Morphology of untreated and Casearin X-treated HL-60 cells after 24 h of incubation.

In fact, Cas X-treated cells displayed apoptotic features concentrations as low as 0.7 uM with an increase in necrotic cells at 3.0 uM, probably as a result of a later apoptosis stage.\n\nGenerally, apoptotic cells simultaneously show membrane integrity and high rates of DNA fragmentation [5].

Also, a critical stage of apoptosis involves the acquisition of surface changes by dying cells, which trigger their specific recognition and removal by phagocytes, where the latter could eventually prevent potential tissue injury resulting from cell lysis _in situ_[44]. This cell engulfment is signaled by externalization of PS, a phospholipid predominantly observed on the inner surface facing the cytosol [32]. If apoptosis is activated, PS on the external leaflet of the lipid bilayer can be detected using annexin V, a 35-kDa Ca2+-binding protein, with high affinity for PS. The lower dose effects observed after Cas X treatment were membrane integrity, mitochondrial depolarization, DNA fragmentation and PS externalization, all features of apoptosis. As a nuclear feature of apoptosis, the internucleosomal fragmentation of double-stranded DNA is attributed to caspases, cysteine aspartate-specific proteases synthesized as zymogens that cleave different proteins, such as caspase-3, the major effector caspase that predominantly disintegrates laminin and nuclear mitotic apparatus proteins [45]. With increasing concentration of Cas X, necrosis features such as loss of membrane integrity, loss of mitochondrial depolarization, and caspase 3/7 highly activated were observed after Cas X treatment. These data confirm those obtained with morphological approaches (trypan blue exclusion and AO/EB and H&E staining) in which dose-dependent effects were observed, suggestive of secondary necrosis or late apoptosis.\n\nSecondary necrosis occurs when apoptotic cells cannot maintain ATP production or control oxidative stress [46]. Dose-dependent regulation of cellular processes is one of the most important characteristics of signaling molecules naturally occurring in cells. Therefore, depending on the concentration used, many different processes may be influenced and/or altered [47]. The data presented here are at odds with a previous work by Carvalho et al. [13] who demonstrated that casearins G, S and T displayed DNA damage via acetylation in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ mutants. Our findings are also in agreement with those of Huang et al. [23] who discovered that caseamenbrins A-F, clerodane diterpenes isolated from _C. membranacea_ leaves, are able to activate caspase-8 and -9 in PC-3 cells.\n\nIn conclusion, the data presented in this work demonstrate that casearins L, O and X have a strong cytotoxic effect on leukemia cell lines, while (-)-hardwickic acid does not, which is probably related to the highly oxygenated backbone present in the casearins and absent in (-)-hardwickic acid. Also, we provide strong evidence that Cas X exerts its cytotoxic effect through induction of apoptosis, which emphasizes the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties and as interesting lead molecules for the design of new anticancer drugs.\n\n## Conflicts of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank CNPq, Instituto Claude Bernard, FAPESP, FUNCAP, and FINEP for the financial support.

The gingerols purification was carried out in HPLC system using a Luna-C18 and the best mobile phase evaluated was MeOH/H2O (75:25, v/v). This new methodology for the gingerols isolation was very effective, since considerable amounts (in the range of milligrams) with a good purity degree (~98%) were achieved in 30 min of chromatographic run. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol purified by this methodology inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of \\(666.2\\pm 134.6\\) uM, \\(135.6\\pm 22.6\\) uM and \\(12.1\\pm 0.3\\) uM, respectively. These substances also inhibited human fibroblasts (HF) cell proliferation, however in concentrations starting from 500 uM. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an optimization of gingerols isolation and their specific anti-proliferative activities against tumor cells, suggesting their use as important models for drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSeveral population-based studies indicate that people in Asian countries have a much lower risk of different cancer types such as colon, gastrointestinal, prostate and breast, when compared to their Western counterparts. It is widely claimed that constituents of their diet such as ginger, garlic, soy, curcumin, onion, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, chillies, and green tea contribute to that lower incidence [1]. Therefore, there is increasing interest in naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive agents.\n\nGinger (_Zingiber officinale_foccinekosce) is widely used worldwide as a food, space and herb [2], Together with [6]-gingerol, [8]- and [10]-gingerol are the major pungent constituents in the ginger oleoresin from fresh rhizome, being [6]-gingerol the most abundant. Gingerols comprise a series of homologue substances differentiated by the length of their alkyl chains with [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol having 10, 12 and 14 carbons in their unbranched alkyl chains, respectively [3].\n\nRegarding [6]-gingerol a variety of pharmacological characteristics was already described, including analgesic, antipyretic, cardiotonic, hypothermia inducing and cancer preventing effects [4, 5, 6]. However, the effects on tumor cell proliferation for [8]- and [10]-gingerol are still scarce.\n\nBreast cancer is the third most frequent cancer in the world and one of the most common malignant diseases in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the second highest cause of death in women after cervical cancer [7]. To treat breast and many other cancer types, chemotherapy is one of the most extensively studied methods. However, its efficacy and safety remain a primary concern as well as its toxicity and other side effects [8, 9]. Another reason for concern regarding this method is the development of chemotherapy resistance, which is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of many tumor types, including breast cancer [8]. Tumor cells are found to adopt multiple mechanisms to resist drugs, such as decreased uptake, and/or enhanced efflux and altered drug \n\n## Page 2\n\nmetabolism. Alteration in drug targets, activation of detoxification systems, enhanced DNA repair ability, and inhibition of apoptosis are also cancer cell strategies to resist against chemotherapy drugs [10].\n\nMany anticancer therapies can temporarily stop tumor growth; it means that, in most cases, the effect is not permanent. In this way, there is a significant need for new agents with low susceptibility to common drug resistance mechanisms in order to improve response rates and potentially prolong patient's survival. Approximately 30% of the women diagnosed with early-stage disease progress to metastatic breast cancer. To these women, therapeutic options are still limited. Current recommendations for first-line chemotherapy include anthracycline-based and taxanes treatments (paclitaxel and docetaxel) [8]. Taxanes - which are taxol derivatives that were first described as microtubule stabilizing agents [11] and then had their antineoplastic effects confirmed [12,13] - are the first example of natural product derivatives used in antitumor therapy. Therefore, the search for new natural products that may be used as an additional alternative to the chemotherapy in an attempt to develop more effective drugs with fewer side effects is of great interest [14]. Based on this assumption it is important to develop an effective method for the isolation of these compounds.\n\nThe aim of this work was to search a faster, efficient and productive procedure for isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol by reverse phase HPLC operating under overloading conditions and to test their anti-proliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumor line and normal human fibroblasts (HF), a non tumor cell line. The results presented in this study showed a more specific anti-proliferative activity for [8]- and [10]-gingerol against breast cancer compared to HF and suggest their use as important models for anti-cancer therapy in an attempt to develop new drugs with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Chemicals\n\n[6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol were isolated from the ethanol extract of the ginger rhizome (purchased locally) by liquid chromatography. The structures were elucidated by 1H NMR using a Bruker DRX200 instrument (Bruker, USA), operating at 200 MHz for 1H spectra, with TMS as internal standard, GC-MS on a Shimadzu QP 5000 and comparison with literature data. The purity was determined by elemental analysis on an EA 1108, CHMS-O (Fisons). HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from JTBaker Company (Netherland). Water was deionised. All other analytical grade reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n### [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation\n\nThe fresh ginger rhizome was thin sliced, dried at 40 degC and ground to powder. The powder was extracted with ethanol for 72 h, three times. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 degC. The extraction of ginger (0.4 kg dry weight) yielded 21.2 g of crude extract (5.3%). The extract was stored at -4 degC for the later fractionation.\n\nIn order to isolate [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, dry ginger rhizome crude ethanol extract was chromatographed on SiO2 (70-230 mesh) column with bed height 20 cm (20 cm x 8 cm i.d.), using initially _n_-hexane (1 L), to eliminate the lipids. After, _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate 50:50 (v/v, 2.5 L) was used as eluent resulting in 5 fractions (A1-5), where the fractions A1, A2, A3 and A4 (68.8%, 14.6 g), rich in [6]- and [10]-gingerols, were joined resulting in the fraction A1-4. Part of this fraction (5.5 g) was re-chromatographed on SiO2 column (28 cm x 5 cm i.d.) using _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate 60:40 (v/v, 2.4 L). Forty eight fractions (50 mL each) were collected and combined after monitoring by TLC resulting in six sub-fractions with the following volumes: 250 mL (B1), 400 mL(B2), 150 mL(B3), 800 mL(B4), 200 mL(B5) and 600 mL (B6). The gingerols were the main constituent on the fraction B4 (800 mL, 2.8 g, yellow oil).\n\nAnalytical and semi-preparative HPLC were carried out using a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP system with an SPD-10AVP UV-vis detector with a flow cell analytical or flow cell preparative, according with the HPLC mode (analytical or semi-preparative), and a Shimadzu LC-6AD pump. The isolation optimization was carried out on a Lura-C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., 10 mm, homemade, UFSCar, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil) and the column was maintained at 25 degC, the detection wavelength was set at 282 nm and the flow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phases consisted of isocratic binary mixtures (v/v) of MeOH/H2O (80:20; 75:25; 70:30) and ACN/H2O (67:33). Forty microliters of methanol containing 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of B4 sample were injected. In the column scale-up reverse phase semi-preparative, a Luna-C18 column (300 mm x 10 mm i.d., 10 mm, homemade, UFSCar, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil) was used. This column was maintained at 25 degC, the detection wavelength was set at 254 nm (lower absorbance wavelength for the gingerols) and the flow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The best mobile phase was MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v) and the scale-up factor was calculated using Eq. (1) below, where \\(S\\), \\(R\\), \\(L\\), \\(P\\), \\(A\\) are scale-up factor, column radius, column length, semi-preparative and analytical columns, respectively. The maximum amount of fraction B4 injected in the semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg diluted to final volume of 400 mL.\n\n\\[S = \\frac{R_{\\text{P}}^{2}\\text{xL}_{\\text{H}}}{R_{\\text{A}}^{2}\\text{xL}_{\\text{H}}}\\]\n\n### Cell line and culture\n\nMDA-MB-231 human breast tumor and HF cell lines, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), were maintained at 37 degC in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cutilab - Campinas; SP, Brazil) containing 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum), penicillin (100 UI/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and L-glutamine (2 mM). Cell cultures and experiments were conducted in a humidified environment with 5% CO2 at 37 degC.\n\n### Proliferation assays\n\nCell lines were prepared at a concentration of 5 x 104 cells/200 mL, in appropriate medium with 10% of FBS, and plated on sterile 96-well plates for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14-18 h at 37 degC and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, known as starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation, the culture medium was removed from the wells and a new one, supplemented with 10% of FBS, containing different concentrations of the tested compounds was added to the wells. The cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h under the same conditions as described above. Cell proliferation assay was performed in comparison to the wells where the vehicle compound (2.5% DMSO) was added instead of the tested compounds. After incubation, the culture medium of each well was removed and a solution containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added (100 mL/well). The plates were then kept at 37 degC for 4 h and the formed crystals were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. The absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 595 nm. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control for inhibition of cell proliferation [15].\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nEach experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and a standard error mean was calculated. Shapiro-Wilk's \\(W\\) test was used to verify data normality. As normal distribution was present, the results were compared statistically with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Since the ANOVA tests showed significant differences (acceptable \\(P\\) level < 0.05). Bonferroni's significant difference _post_ hoc analyses were performed to determine differences between simple and grouped main-effect means, respectively. The data were analyzed by using Statistica software (version 8.0; Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, USA) and IC50 calculations were made using Hill's equation in the Origin software (version 8.5; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA).\n\n## Results\n\n### [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation\n\nFour different conditions were carried out on analytical C18 column HPLC to achieve the best separation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol. The best separation condition was achieved using MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v), where a good separation of three gingerols in a single run of 30 min was obtained (Fig. 1).\n\nThe injection volume (400 mL) was larger than the usual size of an injection volume and also it was not the one that was calculated by the scale up formula. This occurred because of the sample viscosity, which would be very high if 170.1 mg were diluted in 230 mL (calculated volume) that would impair the chromatographic separation. For column overloading with the sample, increasing amounts of fraction B4 (0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg diluted to final volume 40 mL) were injected in a C18 analytical column. Using the detector at 282 nm electronic saturation was observed when 5 mg of sample was injected, although the peaks were still visible for isolation of gingerols until 15 mg. With the injection of 30 mg of sample, the electronic saturation hindered the visualization of peaks closer to peak 1 (Fig. 2). To solve this problem, on the semi-preparative mode, the detector was set at 254 nm and in this condition it was possible to identify the three gingerols present in the fraction.\n\nUsing Eq. (1) for the determination of scale-up factor, the value 5.67 was obtained, consequently the maximum amount of B4 fraction that could be injected in a semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg (Fig. 3). However, to make the adjustment of the flow rate easier we decided to use 6.0 mL/min instead of 5.67 mL/min, and by working in this condition the results obtained were satisfactory.\n\nThe mass of each gingerol obtained from 170.1 mg of fraction B4 was: 94 mg ([6]-gingerol), 22 mg ([8]-gingerol) and 17 mg ([10]-gingerol). The purity of gingerols was calculated based on the elemental analysis of each gingerol. The purification yields based on the fresh ginger weight were 1027, 241 and 187 ppm for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. The purity obtained was 94.4, 99 and 97.3% for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively.\n\nFig. 1: Chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]-gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale.

The same pattern was observed after 48 h of [10]-gingerol incubation; there was a cell proliferation inhibition of about 90% (Fig. 4A).\n\nHF were used in order to compare the effects of both [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in a non tumor cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). No significant differences in MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation using 1, 10, 50 and 100 \\(\\mu\\)M for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in 24 or 48 h of incubation were verified. However, 500 and 1000 \\(\\mu\\)M concentrations were effective in this inhibition, but in an approximate rate of only 50% (Fig. 4A and B).\n\nThe differential effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 \\(\\mu\\)M after 48 h of incubation with HF and MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line are demonstrated in Fig. 5. These compounds were more effective in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (MDA-MB-231) when compared to normal cell proliferation (HF). The IC50 values for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation were calculated. The results showed that these compounds inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 \\(\\pm\\) 134.6 \\(\\mu\\)M; 135.6 \\(\\pm\\) 22.6 \\(\\mu\\)M and 12.1 \\(\\pm\\) 0.3 \\(\\mu\\)M, respectively. These substances also inhibit HF cell proliferation, nevertheless, we were not able to calculate the IC50 values for this cell line, since the initial concentration that had an effect was 500 \\(\\mu\\)M for [6]-, [8] and [10]-gingerol.\n\n## Discussion\n\nStudies of isolation and purification of gingerols are scarce in the literature. Considering the interesting biological activities and the potential of these compounds to the medical area it is imperative to develop new methodologies to achieve an optimization of gingerol separation and purification. The isolation of gingerols ([6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol) described in this work was achieved satisfactorily, once it was possible to obtain relatively high mass and a good degree of gingerols purity. To our knowledge, only one work about isolation of gingerols using HPLC system was published [18]. In this work, the authors isolated the major gingerols from the crude dichloromethane extract of ginger rhizome by normal phase HPLC. A low purity degree (calculated by the percentage of peak area) for both, [8]-gingerol (86%) and [10]-gingerol (84%) was achieved, while for the [6]-gingerol the purity was 99%. The purity degree obtained for each gingerol does not represent the real one, because HPLC system using UV detection does not guarantee the absence of other components in the sample. In a recent work, the isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol was carried out using counter-current chromatography (CCC). In this study gingerols were obtained with high purity degree (99%), however the time of chromatographic run was very length (240 min) [19]. In another work regarding isolation of gingerols from crude extract of ginger rhizome using CCC the time of chromatographic run was again very extensive, and the purity was about 98% [20].\n\nElectronic saturation is a factor that considerable limits the increasing of injected mass in the semi-preparative scale. In our work, this factor had limited injections of samples with higher masses, even at a wavelength of low absorption of gingerols (254 nm) (Fig. 3). However, the gingerols were isolated in significant quantities and with a good purity degree. To avoid the electronic saturation we could use either a less sensitive flow cell or make the adjustment of the wavelength well off the lambda max. We have not tried a less sensitive cell, however all the experiment conditions were tested in the lower absorption wavelength for the gingerols, and we still obtained electronic saturation. It may be possible to use other detectors even though we have only used UV.\n\nThe effects of [6]-gingerol on tumor cell proliferation are already well documented [5, 21, 22, 23], however, the effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on tumor cells are still scarce. In fact, among all the ginger constituents, much more attention has been given to [6]-gingerol in order to explore its pharmacological properties and action mechanisms. In this sense, besides [6]-gingerol effects, those of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on _in vitro_ tumor cell proliferation using MDA-MB-231 and HF cell lines were also investigated.\n\nThe overall results suggest that the higher the alkyl chain, the greater the effectiveness of gingerol in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, probably due to the manner in which these substances enter the cells through their plasma membrane. In general, with increasing alkyl chain lengths, there is an increase in lipophilic character (log _P_) of compounds, and this can be quantified by the partition coefficient (_P_) in an n-octanol/water system. It is also known that the higher the log \\(P\\) value, to a certain extent, the higher will be the permeation in biological membranes [24, 25]. This can be extended to compounds such as gingerols, which represent a homologous series of substances.\n\nSimilar effects of gingerols and other ginger-derived substances were already described in the literature. Tjendraputra et al. [26] demonstrated that the inhibition of COX-2 by ginger constituents and synthetic analogs was structure-dependent. The lipophilicity and the functional group substitution on the alkyl side chain, as well as the aromatic moiety were the main aspects influencing COX-2 inhibition. Similar correlations between the side-chain length of gingerols and their activities of apoptosis induction and neuronal cells protection from b-amyloid insult have already been demonstrated [27, 28].\n\nThe cytotoxic effect of [8]- and [10]-gingerol has been investigated by a few authors [27, 29]. Kim and coworkers [29] have tested the effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol in a variety of human tumor cells lines including A-549 (lung cancer), SK-OV-3 (ovarian cancer), SK-MEL-2 (skin cancer) and HCT15 (colon cancer). They found an IC50 ranging from approximately 4.52 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL (13 \\(\\mu\\)M) to 12.57 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL (40 \\(\\mu\\)M), with [10]-gingerol being more effective than [8]-gingerol in decreasing the viability of these tumor cell lines [29]. Wei and coworkers [27] found an IC50 of 87.9 \\(\\pm\\) 3.5 \\(\\mu\\)M and 56.5 \\(\\pm\\) 6.0 \\(\\mu\\)M for [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively, in the inhibition of HL-60 proliferation, a human leukemia tumor cell line. These data are in accordance with the findings in this work on MDA-MB-231 cells, revealing the same activity dependence on the chain length size pattern.\n\nKuo and collaborators [30] working with SW480 cells, a lineage of colorectal cancer, observed that [10]-gingerol caused a significant concentration-dependent and sustained [Ca\\({}^{2+}\\)]i rise, suggesting that this elevation can alter cellular functions, leading to cell death. They found a cytotoxic effect of [10]-gingerol 50, 75 and 100 \\(\\mu\\)M [30]. It is important to notice that the methodology in the present study was different, even though, similar effects were found in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line.\n\nOur findings demonstrate a specificity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on the inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation when compared to non tumor human fibroblast cell line. The findings of other authors corroborate with our results. Kazi et al. [31] described the effects of antibiotics derived from b-lactam, lactam 1 and 12 on normal and tumor cells. They show that lactam 1 selectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat T, but not in the non transformed, immortalized human natural killer cells. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that lactam 12 induces apoptosis selectively in Jurkat T and simian virus 40-transformed, but not in non transformed NK and parental normal fibroblast cells. The authors propose that these N-tholated b-lactams act by inducing DNA damage that leads to apoptosis preferentially in cancer and transformed over normal/non transformed cells. Another example includes pancratistatin, a natural compound isolated from the \n\n## Page 6\n\nspider lily, which is an efficient inducer of apoptosis in human lymphoma (Jurkat) cells, with minimal effect on normal nucleated blood cells. The authors discuss that this selective effect could be due to the expression of the Fas receptors, which are found to be greater in blood lymphoma cells than normal blood cells. Furthermore, in fast-dividing cancer cells, the plasma membrane tends to run short of lipids, perhaps changing the fluidity of the membrane [32]. Ovadje et al. [33] demonstrate that dandelion root extract is capable of inducing apoptosis at low concentrations specifically in cancer cells with no toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, Mathen et al. [34] working with extracts from _Calotropis gigamate_, the giant milkweed, traditionally used for the treatment of cancer and in Ayuravledi medicine and _Poecilocerus pictus_, an orthopteran insect, which feeds on _C. gigantea_, demonstrated that both the insect and the plant extracts induce concentration-dependent apoptosis and differentiate between human cancer cells and normal cells and exhibit species specificity.\n\nThe chemopreventive mechanisms of singereols are not well understood however, are thought to involve proapoptotic [27, 35, 36, 37], antioxidant [38], anti-inflammatory [6, 39, 40, 41], and anti-angiogenic [42] activities. Further investigation will be done in order to determine the mechanisms by which [8]- and [10]-gingerol act inhibiting with more specificity the MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this work presents a new methodology for the isolation of singereols, which proved to be effective, once considerable amounts with a good purity degree in a relatively short time of chromatographic run were achieved from these important bioactive compounds, mainly [8]-gingerol (99%) and [10]-gingerol (97.3%). This is the first report on the separation of these compounds with such a purity degree using HPLC semi-preparative scale. Optimizations in the separation process regarding column overloading can still be made so that the electron saturation be not reached, which can be achieved by using other less sensitive detectors. The singereols isolated through this methodology, demonstrate an anti-proliferative activity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol specifically on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells when compared to HF normal cells. As far as we know, this is the first report regarding a specific cell effect of ginger derivatives. The results also suggest the use of [8]- and [10]-gingerol as important models for anti-cancer therapy and drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## References\n\n* (1) T.

(Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a familiar Brazilian species popularly known as Taruma whose leaf tea has been used by population to treat kidney diseases. The aim of this research was to investigate the hydroalcoholic extract of leaves in order to isolate the active compounds. Hydroalcoholic extract of leaves was obtained by stirring the previous hexane and methanol extracted leaves residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing. The obtained extract was partitioned with _n_-butanol. The yielded fraction was subsequently submitted to several chromatographic procedures to lead to the isolation of _O_-glycosidicflavones orientin and isoorientin as well as _C_-glycosylflavones schafoside and carlinoside along with their isomers, known as potent anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antioxidant agents, then identified as the active constituents, justifying the folk use of the plant to combat and prevent kidney stone and inflammation.\n\nkeywords: _Vitex polygamma_; Verbenaceae; Lamiaceae; Kidney diseases; _C_-glycosylflavones; _O_-glycosylflavones +\nFootnote †: journal:\n\n## 1 Plant\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, according to Cantino et al., 1992; formerly Verbenaceae, in keeping with Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the States of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957). The plant was collected in July 2000, in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and authenticated by Dr. Fatima Regina Salimena-Pires, a taxonomic botanist from Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras da Universidade de Sao Paulo, _campus_ Ribeirao Preto (SPFR), Brazil, under the acquisition number 9968.\n\n## 2 Use in traditional medicine\n\nThe leaf tea is used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat and prevent kidney stone and inflammation (Rodrigues, 2001).\n\n## 3 Previously isolated classes of constituents\n\nIn preceding studies, _Vitex polygamma_ has been found to contain sesquiterpenes, fatty acids (Barbosa et al., 1995), 2''_O_-caffeoylorientin besides other common flavones simultaneously with some _O_-glycosylated derivatives, flavonols, phenolic acids (Leitao and Delle Monache, 1998), several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the essential oil (Leitao et al., 1999), phytosteroids, caffeoylesters from quinic acid (Santos, 2000), and ecdysteroids (Santos et al., 2001).\n\n## 4 Materials and methods\n\nThe powder of the air-dried leaves (423.0 g) was extracted successively with hexane and methanol (MeOH) through percolation process at room temperature. Hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing for 10 min (3\\(\\times\\) 300 mL).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nThe resulting filtrates were subsequently combined, evaporated _in vacuum_ (40 degC) and lyophilized. Afterward, the extract (31 g, 31%, w/w of the dry leaves weight (DLW)) was dissolved in distilled water and fractionated through liquid-liquid partition using ethyl acetate (EA) and _n_-BuOH (BU) (5\\(\\times\\) 300 mL each) to yield EA (2.2 g, 2.2%, w/w DLW) and BU (10.7 g, 10.7%, w/w DLW) fractions, respectively. BU fraction was subjected to CC using XAD7 (46.0 cm x 4.0 cm) and subsequent elution with 500 mL of water (WV), water/MeOH 1:1 (WMV) and 2 L of MeOH (MV). One gram of the dried fraction MV (6.75 g, 6.75%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (53.0 cm x 3.0 cm) using MeOH as eluent resulting in 41 fractions of 30 mL, which were pooled into seven fractions (MV1 to MV7). Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg, 1.13%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with MeOH. Twenty-three fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg, 0.39% w/w DLW) was further purified by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase MeOH, flow-rate 3 mL min\\({}^{-1}\\); \\(\\lambda\\) 330 nm) to yield compounds **1** and **2** (5.5 mg, 0.04%, w/w DLW), substances **3** and **4** (3.1 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) after three cycles of 54 min. Fraction 5 (MV5, 293.1 mg, 1.98%, w/w DLW) was submitted to the same R-HPLC system to yield compounds **5** and **6** (20.5 mg, 0.14%, w/w DLW) as mixture, and compounds **7** and **8** (3.0 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) also as mixture. Fraction WV, after recrystallization in 90% aqueous MeOH solution, afforded substance **9** (280.0 mg).\n\n## Results\n\nFrom _n_-BuOH partition of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves from _Vitex polygamma_ were isolated the compounds caffeoyl 6-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside (**1**), caffeoyl 6-_O_-a-d-d-glucopyranoside (**2**), schafoside (**3**), isoschafoside (**4**), orientin (**5**), isoorientin (**6**), carlinoside (**7**), isocarlinoside (**8**) and metacrylic acid (**9**) whose chemical structures (Fig. 1) were identified by means of \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR as well as HMBC, HSQC and negative ESI/MS spectra data which were in accordance with previously reported data (Kitagawa, 1984; Besson et al., 1985; Dayrit et al., 1987; Shimomura et al., 1988). Schafoside and its isomer is known for its efficacy as anti-inflammatory (Melo et al., 2005) and preventive effect against kidney stone in rats, as evaluated by urine output, excretion of Ca, citric acid, and creatinine analysis (Kubo et al., 1989). Moreover the _C_-glycosidic flavones **3**, **4**, **7** and **8** are being reported for the first time in the genus _Vitex_.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to ALCOA S.A. for facilitating the plant collection.\n\nFigure 1: Chemical structures of compounds isolated from _Vitex polygamma_ _n_-butanoic extract.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThis study has been supported by Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ).\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Barbosa, L.C.A., Demuner, A.J., Howarth, O.W., Pereira, N.S., Veloso, D.P., 1995.

All rights reserved.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families are rich sources of quinonemethide triterpenes (Bruning and Wagner, 1978; Gunatilaka, 1996), and these compounds have a variety of biological activities such as antitumor (Bhatnagar et al., 1979; Goncalves de Lima et al., 1971), antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971); antibiotic (Goncalves de Lima et al., 1969; Gonzalez et al., 1977); cytotoxic (Setzer et al., 1998) and antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989; Figueiredo et al., 1998) properties. Systematic studies on Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae plant species (Corsino et al., 1998a,b,c, 2000, 2003; Buffa Filho et al., 2002) have been concerned with biosynthesis of quinonemethide triterpenes, the main secondary metabolites in this taxon. The biosynthetic study dealing on _Maytenus aquifolium_ (Celastraceae) and _Salacia campestris_ (Hippocrateaceae) indicated that friedelane triterpenes are putative precursors of quinonemethide triterpenes, which are biosynthesized in the leaves and translocated to the root bark, where these compounds would be transformed into quinone methide triterpenes (Corsino et al., 2000). These findings have led us to investigate other species of Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae. _Cheiloclinium cognatum_ (Miers) A.C. Sm. (Hippocrateaceae) a tree widely distributed in the Cerrado region of Brazil, was selected to investigate the oxidative transformation on the E ring of the quinonemethide triterpenes. With this objective, we carried out a chemical study on this plant species, which led to the isolation of two new triterpenes, 228-hydroxypristimerin (**1**) and cognatine (**2**), besides seven known quinonemethide triterpenes; pristimerin (**3**), maytenin (**4**), 228-hydroxymarytenin (**5**), 202-hydroxymethyl-netazahualcoyonol (**6**), netzahualcoyondiol (**8**) and netzahualcoyone (**9**). The free radical scavenging activities of the isolates have been evaluated through a spectro-photometric assay using the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-picryl hydrazyl(DPPH).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 2. Results and discussion\n\nA CH2Cl2 soluble fraction obtained from the ethanolic extract of the root bark _C. cognatum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further purified by preparative TLC and/or HPLC, affording compounds **1-9**.\n\n22b-Hydroxypristimerin (**1**), obtained as a red amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C30H40O5 by analysis of its ESI/MS spectrum, elemental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 3450 cm-1 (hydroxyl group) and 1724 and 1645 cm-1 (carbonyl groups). The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** revealed the presence of six methyl singlets at \\(d\\) 2.13, 1.38, 1.22, 1.15, 0.99 and 0.41, attributed to H3-23, H3-25, H3-26, H3-30, H3-28 and H3-27, respectively, (Table 1). The quinon-cmethodie moiety was characterized by a doublet at \\(d\\) 6.26 (1H, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz), a singlet at \\(d\\) 6.41 (1H) and a doublet at \\(d\\) 6.94 (1H, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz) attributed to H-7, H-1 and H-6, respectively. The singlet at \\(d\\) 2.13, characteristic of a methyl group attached to a _sp_2 carbon (H3-23), corroborated the presence of a quinonemethide system. Further oxygenated functional groups were assumed to be hydroxyl and ester on the basis of NMR spectral analysis. The 13C NMR, gHHBC and gHMQC spectra (Table 2) showed the presence of 30 carbons in **1**. In the 13C NMR spectrum two carbonyl carbon signals (_d_ 178.2 and \\(d\\) 178.3) attributed to C-29 and C-2, respectively, six methyl carbons (_d_ 38.1, 32.2, 24.0, 21.6, 19.0 and 10.1), six methylene carbons (_d_ 38.1, 36.1, 33.5, 30.8, 29.5 and 28.2), four methine carbons (_d_ 134.0, 119.5, 118.0 and 46.1), 10 quaternary carbons (_d_ 169.7, 164.6, 146.0, 127.3, 117.2, 44.5, 42.6, 42.4, 39.2 and 38.2), one methoxyl carbon (_d_ 51.6) and one hydroxy-methine carbon (_d_ 67.9) were observed. The assignments were based on gHMQC and gHHBC spectra and by comparison with published data on pristimerin (Gunatilaka, 1989, 1996). The correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum from the singlet at \\(d\\) 0.99 (H3-28) to the hydroxymethine carbon at \\(d\\) 67.9 (Fig. 1) and the signals at \\(d\\) 36.1 (C-16), 38.1 (C-17) and 46.1 (C-18), confirmed the attachment of the hydroxyl group at C-22. The relative stereochemistry of H-22 was deduced by the coupling constant values (_d_ 4.02, \\(J_{22{\\rm as/21ax}}\\) = 11.0 Hz and \\(J_{22{\\rm as/21eq}}\\) = 4.0 Hz), which corroborated the _equatorial_ orientation of the hydroxyl group. The ester group was confirmed by a singlet at \\(d\\) 3.50 (3H) attributed to a methoxyl portion of the ester group at C-29, which was confirmed by means of correlation of the methyl group at \\(d\\) 1.15 (C-30) with the carbonyl carbon of the ester group at \\(d\\) 178.2 (C-29) observed in the gHMBC spectrum (Fig. 1). The structure of **1** was determined as 22b-hydroxypristimerin.\n\nCognatine (**2**), isolated as a pale yellow amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C31H38O7 by means of analysis of ESI/MS data, elemental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl group at 3438 cm-1 and carbonyl groups at 1718 and 1643 cm-1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of two singlets at \\(d\\) 6.85 (1H), attributed to H-1 and at \\(d\\) 6.00 (1H) assigned to H-7. Also, two methoxyl groups signals at \\(d\\) 3.73 and 3.74 (3H, each) were observed, which were characterized as methoxyl groups attached to C-3 and belonging to the ester group at C\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Position & **1** & **2** \\\\\n1 & 6.41 (_s_) & 6.85 (_s_) \\\\\n6 & 6.94 (_d_, \\(J\\), = 6, 5 Hz) & – \\\\\n7 & 6\n\n## Page 3\n\n29, respectively, as evidenced by gHMBC experiments (Fig. 2). Other singlets integrating for 3H each were observed at \\(\\delta\\) 2.67, assigned to a methyl group on aromatic ring (H\\({}_{3}\\)-23), at \\(\\delta\\) 1.72 assigned to one methyl group on double bond (C-26) and at \\(\\delta\\) 1.38, 1.33, 0.95 and 0.90, corresponding to tertiary methyl groups (H\\({}_{3}\\)-28, H\\({}_{3}\\)-25, H\\({}_{3}\\)-30 and H\\({}_{3}\\)-27, respectively).\n\nThe analysis of the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR (Table 2), gHMQC and gHMBC spectral data indicated the presence of three carbonyl carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 214.0, 185.8 and 175.2 attributed to C-22, C-6 and C-29, respectively, six methyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 27.6, 23.9, 22.5, 21.7, 15.1 and 13.7, attributed to C-25, C-27, C-28, C-26, C-23 and C-30, respectively, two vinylic carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 134.7 and 125.9, two vinylic carbons conjugated to carbonyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 160.1 and 129.3, four methylene carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 38.0, 37.1, 35.8 and 34.2, one methine carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 46.2, five quaternary aromatic carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 151.7, 151.2, 144.7, 134.0 and 122.4. The remaining signal was an unsubstituted aromatic carbon (\\(\\delta\\) 110.1), which was assigned to C-1. Additionally, sig\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline Position & **1** & **2** & **7** & **8** & **9** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 119.5 \\(d\\) & 110.1 \\(d\\) & 119.4 \\(d\\) & 120.0 \\(d\\) & 120.1\n\n## Page 4\n\nnals for four quaternary carbons (\\(\\delta\\) 42.2, 40.7, 48.8 and 50.3), two \\(sp^{3}\\) carbons belonging to methoxyl groups (\\(\\delta\\) 52.7 and 61.7) and one hydroxymethine carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 74.3 were also observed.\n\nThe gHMBC data (Fig. 2) showed the correlation of the singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 6.85 (H-I) to the carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 151.7 (C-2), \\(\\delta\\) 144.7 (C-3), \\(\\delta\\) 122.4 (C-5) and \\(\\delta\\) 42.2 (C-9) and the singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 6.00 (H-7) to the carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 134.7 (C-4), \\(\\delta\\) 122.4 (C-5) and \\(\\delta\\) 42.2 (C-9) corroborating unambiguously the assignments of H-I and H-7. Besides, the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 6.85 (1H, H-I) was correlated to \\(\\delta\\) 110.1 (C-I) and the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 6.00 (1H, H-7) showed correlation to \\(\\delta\\) 129.3 (C-7) in the HMQC spectrum. The correlation between the methoxy signal at \\(\\delta\\) 3.73 and the carbon signal at \\(\\delta\\) 144.7 confirmed the position of the methoxyl group at C-3. Also, the gHMBC spectrum showed correlations from the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.22 (H\\({}_{3}\\)-26) to signals at \\(\\delta\\) 125.9 and \\(\\delta\\) 134.7, assigned to carbons C-14 and C-15, respectively. The signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.38 (H\\({}_{3}\\)-28) showed correlations with the carbon signal at \\(\\delta\\) 38.0 (C-16) and also with the carbonyl signal at \\(\\delta\\) 214.0, which confirmed the position of one carbonyl group at C-22. An additional correlation from the methyl signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.72 (H\\({}_{3}\\)-26) to the carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 38.0 (C-16) corroborated the attribution of the other carbonyl at C-6, with the chemical shift at \\(\\delta\\) 185.6 being characteristic of an \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carbonyl and C-16, a methylenic carbon. The remaining gHMBC correlations from H\\({}_{3}\\)-30 (\\(\\delta\\) 0.95) to C-19 (\\(\\delta\\) 34.2) and the hydroxymethine carbon at C-21 (\\(\\delta\\) 74.3), besides correlation of methoxyl hydrogens at \\(\\delta\\) 3.74 with the carbonyl signal at C-29 (\\(\\delta\\) 175.2), established the proposed structure **2** for cognate.\n\nThe known compounds pristimerin **(3)**, maytenin **(4)**, 22\\(\\beta\\)-hydroxymaytenin **(5)** and 20\\(\\alpha\\)-hydroxymaytenin **(6)** were identified by comparison with published data (Gunatilaka, 1989; Gunatilaka, 1996; Dhanabalasingham et al., 1996; Furlan et al., 1990). Compounds **7-9** had been previously isolated from _Orthosphenia mexicana_ (Gonzalez et al., 1983), but a number of inconsistencies were found regarding the assignments of published \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data. The analysis of 2D NMR spectra allowed accurate assignment of \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR signals mostly based on gHMQC and gHMBC experiments.\n\nThe spectrophotometric assay using DPPH indicated a prominent free radical scavenging activity for some of the isolated quinonemethide triterpenes (Fig. 3). The stable free radical DPPH has an absorption maximum at 517 nm, which decreases upon reduction through reaction with an antioxidant compound. The free radical scavenging activity of quinonemethide triterpenes is mostly due to the \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carbonyl moiety with extended conjugation through ring B, e.g. in compounds **1** and **3-6** or B-D, e.g. in compounds **7-9**. These features stabilize the quinonemethide free radical promptly formed after loss of one radical hydrogen, donated to the DPPH. The more extended conjugations of triterpenes **7-9** account for their higher free radical scavenging abilities (ca. 45% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) when compared to compounds **1-6** (less than 30% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M). The phenolic triterpene **2** exhibited the lowest activity (18% at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) probably due to the lack of conjugation through rings B-D. The free radical scavenging ability of the quinonemethide triterpenes and a standard compound rutin (66% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) are due to catechol moiety present in the B ring of rutin the C2-C3 double bond (van Acker et al., 1996). The synthetic antioxidant BHT (11% inhibition at 60 \\(\\mu\\)M) exhibited the weakest antiradical activity as expected due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH (Bondet et al., 1997).\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Plant material\n\nRoot bars of _C. cognatum_ (Hippocrateaceae) were collected at Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, GO and identified by Dr Julio Antonio Lombardi (Departamento de Botanica do Institute de Ciencias Biologicas - Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG). A voucher specimen (No. 19797) is deposited at Herbarium of Institute de Ciencias Biologicas - UFG, Goias.\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography\n\nSilica gel (Merck, 230-400 and 70-230 mesh) were used for CC unless otherwise stated and solvents were distilled prior to use. \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) as solvent and TMS as reference. HPLC separations were performed using a Shimadzu LC-10AS. Preparative HPLC separation were performed on a Varian PROSTAR, using a reversed phase column (Phenomenex-Luna C\\({}_{18}\\), 21.2 x 250 mm,\n\nFig. 3: Radical scavenging activity of compounds **1–9** and standards rutin and BHT.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\n10 \\(\\mu\\)m), eluted with MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (7:3, with 0.05\\(\\%\\) H\\({}_{3}\\)PO\\({}_{4}\\)) detection at 420 nm. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ESI-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nDried and powdered root barks of _C. cognatum_ (690.0 g) were extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a brown gum (210.6 g), which was submitted to liquid-liquid partitioning. The CH\\({}_{2}\\)C1\\({}_{2}\\) soluble part of the EtOH extract was concentrated in vacuo (25.5 g), submitted to a silica gel column (600 g, 70-230 mesh) eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient, yielding 41 fractions (A\\({}_{1}\\)-A\\({}_{41}\\)). Fraction A\\({}_{9}\\)-A\\({}_{11}\\) (1.48 g) was submitted to a flash silica gel CC (230-400 mesh), eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient resulting in 32 fractions (B\\({}_{1}\\)-B\\({}_{41}\\)). Fraction B\\({}_{10}\\)-B\\({}_{14}\\) (0.154 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] yielding compound **3** (55 mg). Fraction B\\({}_{18}\\)-B\\({}_{21}\\) (0.085 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] affording compound **4** (34 mg). Fraction A\\({}_{16}\\)-A\\({}_{17}\\) (3.55 g) was submitted to flash silica gel CC (70-230 mesh), eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 46 fractions (C\\({}_{1}\\)-C\\({}_{46}\\)). Fraction C\\({}_{19}\\)-C\\({}_{23}\\) (0.221 g) was submitted to a reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (7:3), \\(\\lambda=420\\) nm, 10 ml min\\({}^{-1}\\)] to afford compounds **1** (63 mg) and **8** (65 mg). Fraction A\\({}_{22}\\)-A\\({}_{26}\\) (2.46 g) was subjected to a flash silica gel CC eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 77 fractions (D\\({}_{1}\\)-D\\({}_{77}\\)). Fraction D\\({}_{23}\\)-D\\({}_{27}\\) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0.05\\(\\%\\)] affording compounds **5** (13 mg) and **6** (23 mg). Fraction D\\({}_{17}\\)-D\\({}_{22}\\) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc Ac (4:1), AcOH 0.05\\(\\%\\)], affording compounds **1** (63 mg) and further purified by reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (7:3), \\(\\lambda=420\\) nm, 10 mL min\\({}^{-1}\\)] affording compounds **7** (18 mg) and **2** (4 mg).\n\n### Radical scavenging activity on DPPH radical\n\nRadical scavenging activity was assayed according to the Blois method (Blois, 1958). The free radical scavenging capacities of quinonemethide triterpenes and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated based on their ability to reduce the free radical already assigned (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 ml) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 to 100 \\(\\mu\\)M were then prepared in MeOH and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004\\(\\%\\)) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated (see Fig. 3).\n\n### 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1)\n\nAmorphous solid.

Mez. showed moderate antifungal activity against _Cidasopporum sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladasoporioides_, triggering further studies. The crude EtOAc extract afforded two new benzopyran derivatives (**2** and **4**) and the known compounds **1** and **3**, which were tested in cell proliferation and antifungal assays. Compound **2** caused a potent proliferative stimulus to two mammalian cell lines and a weak antifungal activity. The dualistic activities described in this study (stimulatory mammalian cell proliferation and antifungal) might be of special interest in what concerns to species specificity action.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe known compounds 2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (**1**) and (2_R_)-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (**3**), were identified by comparing their physical and spectroscopic data with literature values (Nagasawa et al., 1988; Wu et al., 1999). A positive optical rotation displayed by compound **3**, further allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-2 as \\(R\\).\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C12H13O4 ([M + H]+ at _m/z_ 221.0917). Analysis of the NMR, IR and UV spectra, suggested the presence of a chromane derivative (Saengchantara and Wallace, 1990). The 1H NMR spectrum of **2** (Table 1) showed a signal at \\(d\\) 12.70 (1H, _s_) attributed to a chelated phenolic OH. Spin-systems corresponding to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring and a 2-hydroxypropyl group were also observed, along with an isolated olefin proton signal. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals (Table 1) consistent with these units and with the presence of a carbonyl group. The 13C NMR chemical shifts indicated that the benzene ring is 1,3-dioxygenated and that the carbonyl group is part of a benzopyran unit. Data from the _g_HMBC experiment (Table 1) supported these conclusions and enabled completion of structure **2**. For example, correlations of the H-1a' proton with olefinic carbons C-2 and C-3 enabled location at the 2-hydroxypropyl group at C-2. In addition, the selected irradiation 1D-NOESY experiment was conducted on H-3 and showed NOE correlations with H-1a' and H-2'. The absolute configuration of analogue (2'S)-7-hydroxy-2-(2'-hydropropyl)-5-methyl-chromone has been determined as \\(S\\) (Kashiwada et al., 1984) and showed a positive optical rotation. Since **2** also exhibited positive specific rotation, C-2' was assigned the _sinister_ configuration. Based on these and other data and \\(d\\) values, the structure of **2** was defined as (2'S)-2-(propan-2'-ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. Its HRESI mass spectrum exhibited a [M - H2O + H]+ at _m/z_ 163.0757 corresponding to a molecular formula C10H11O2. The absence of a carbonyl band in the IR spectrum suggested reduction at this position relative to **3**. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) revealed the presence of the same 1,3-dioxygenated; 1,2,3-trisubstituted aromatic system for **2** along with a spin-system corresponding to the C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-1' portion of structure **4**. The equatorial and axial orientations of H-4, H-2, H-3 and H-1' were\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} Position & **2** & **4** \\\\\n1H (Δ) & 13C (Δ) & _g_HMBC & NOESY & 1H (Δ) & 13C (Δ) & _g_HMBC \\\\\n2 & – & 170.0 & – & – & _α_4.24 \\(m\\) & 66.6 & C-9 \\\\\n3 & 6.32 \\(s\\) & 109.5 & C-1′, C-10 & H-1′a, H-2′ & _α_1.50 _ddd_ (14.7, 14.7, 4.0) & 38.0 & – \\\\  & & – & – & _α_71.88 _ddd_ (14.7, 4.0, 4.0) & – \\\\\n4 & – & 182.0 & – & – & _α_74.72 _br s_ & 57.1 & C-10 \\\\\n5 & – & 159.9 & – & – & – & 156.8 & – \\\\\n6 & 6.79 \\(d\\) (8.0) & 110.7 & C-10 & – & 6.20 _dd_ (8.0, 1.0) & 106.9 & – \\\\\n7 & 7.63 \\(t\\) (8.0) & 135.6 & C-5, C-9 & – & 6.92 \\(t\\) (8.0) & 128.7 & – \\\\\n8 & 7.03 \\(d\\) (8.0) & 107.3 & C-10 & – & 6.33 _dd_ (8.0, 1.0) & 106.5 & – \\\\\n9 & – & 156.3 & – & – & – & 156.0 & – \\\\\n10 & – & 109.9 & – & – & – & 112.4 & – \\\\\n1′_a_ & 2.68 \\(d\\) (8.5) & 43.5 & C-2, C-3 & H-3 & _α_71.32 \\(d\\) (6.0) & 21.2 & C-2, C-3 \\\\\n1′_b_ & 2.76 \\(d\\) (4.5) & – & – & – & – & – \\\\\n2′ & 4.10 \\(m\\) & 64.2 & – & H-3 & – & – & – \\\\\n3′ & 1.18 \\(d\\) (6.0) & 23.4 & C-1′ & – & – & – & – \\\\\n5-OH & 12.70 s & – & – & – & – & – & – \\\\\n2′-OH & 4.92 \\(d\\) (4.5) & – & – & – & – & – & – \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectroscopic data for compounds **2** and **4** in DMSO-_d_a\n\n## Page 3\n\ndeduced from their coupling constants. Small _J_-values showed by H-4 suggested _vicinal eq-eq_ and _eq-ax_ couplings with H2-3. The H-3_eq_ showed constants that suggested a _vicinal_ coupling _eq-eq_ (4.0 Hz) with H-2 and _eq-ax_ (4.0 Hz) with H-4 and a _geminal_ coupling (14.7 Hz) with H-3_ax_. The 14.7, 14.7 and 4.0 Hz _J_-values for H-3_ax_ indicated a _geminal_ coupling, a _vicinal ax-ax_ coupling with H-2 and an _ax-eq_ coupling with H-4, respectively. Based on the conformational preference of methyl group over hydroxyl, the methyl group at C-2 was assumed to be in an equatorial position on a half-chair ring, which is the preferred conformation for benzopyrans (Joshi and Merchant, 1984). Therefore, due to equatorial position determined for H-4, compound **4** was characterized as the _trans_-isomer at H-4-H-2. All NMR signals were assigned by analysis of _g_HMQC and _g_HMBC experiments (Table 1) and \\(d\\) values. Compound **4** was thus identified as the previously unreported 2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-benzopyran-4,5-diol.\n\nCompounds **1**-**4** (see Scheme 1) were evaluated against _Cladosporium phaerosgpermann_ and _C. cladosporiides_ using direct bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds **1** and **2** exhibited a weak antifungal activity, showing a detection limit of 10 mg for both substances. Compound **3** and **4** did not show any antifungal activity. Nystatin was employed as a positive control showing a detection limit of 1 mg. The reduction at \\(\\Delta^{2,3}\\) in **3**, changing the conformation of the pyrane ring, may be the cause of the loss of the activity.\n\nBiological evaluation of **1**-**4** was also carried out using HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines. Compound **2**, at 20 mmol/L was able to induce 70% increase in cell proliferation to HeLa and 25% to CHO cells, when compared to the DMSO treated cells. The compounds **1**, **3** and **4** were inactive in CHO and displayed a weak stimulatory effect in HeLa cells. When cisplatin, a well known antineoplastic agent, was used as a control, a clear inhibition of cell proliferation was observed.\n\nThe biological activity of **1** and **2** seems to be differentially specific to fungi or mammalian cells, and also to different mammalian cell lines. The indication of a possible specific mechanism of action is of great interest and deserves further investigation.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedure\n\nOptical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 degC. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Nicolet Impact-400 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as an internal standard. HRESI mass spectra were obtained on an Autospec-Micromass mass spectrometer. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) preparative column.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _O. corymbosa_ plant material was collected in \"Estacao Experimental de Araraquara\", Araraquara, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2001. The botanical identification was made by Professor Maria Claudia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No MCMY-1314).\n\n### Isolation of the endophytic fungus\n\nFor the isolation of the endophytic fungus, adult and healthy leaves were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were first washed with water and soap, and immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and finally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 x 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate\n\n## Page 4\n\n(50 mg/mL) with approximately three to four pieces on each dish. The material was incubated at 25 degC for 10 days and the endophyte _Curvularia_ sp. was isolated by replication and preserved in sterile water (Maier et al., 1997). The fungus was identified by Dr. Jose Odair Pereira (UFA) and deposited in NuBBE's collection with culture number \"PAJ-04\".\n\n### Growth of Curvularia and production of the EIOAc extract\n\nThe fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 degC for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 x 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the _Curvularia_ isolated were inoculated into each flask and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 degC on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration, and the filtrate was partitioned with ethyl acetate (3 x 200 mL). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase in vacuo yielded a brown solid residue (158 mg). After this extract was found to display bioactivity, this process was scaled up using 4.0 L of PDB (20 Erlenmeyer flasks) and afforded 1.8 g of EtoAc extract.\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\nThe microorganisms _C. cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and _C. sphaerospermum_ (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. The compounds 1-4 were applied on a pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 mg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control.\n\n### Determination of cell viability after treatment with benzopyrans\n\nHeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were cultured at 37 degC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Penicillin (100 mg/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) were included in medium to prevent bacterial growth. A stock solution (20 mmol/L) was prepared by dissolving compounds 1-4 in DMSO (vehicle). The final concentrations (200, 20 and 2 mmol/L) were achieved by direct dilution into the cell medium. Cells were plated (104 cells/well) in a 48-well tray 24 h prior to the beginning of the experiment. After addition of the compound or the vehicle, cells were analyzed after a period of 48 h using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983; Rubinstein et al., 1990).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe EtoAc extract (1.8 g) was fractionated by column chromatography (CC) using reversed-phase silica gel (ODS) and eluted with a MeOH-H2O gradient (1:9 100% MeOH) affording 8 fractions (A-H). Fraction A (125 mg) was further purified using reverse phase prep. HPLC [_l_ = 221 nm, 12.0 mL/ min., CH3CN:H2O (2:8)] affording **1** (2.2 mg) and **2** (1.8 mg). Fraction B (100 mg) was also purified using reversed phase prep. HPLC [_l_ = 230 nm, 12.0 mL/min., CH3CN:H2O (23:77)], affording **3** (10.2 mg) and finally fraction C (770 mg) was also submitted to reverse phase prep. HPLC, [_l_ = 221 nm, 12.0 mL/min., CH3CN:H2O (37:63)] to afford compound **4** (2.7 mg).\n\n#### 3.7.1 (2'S)-2-(propan-2'-ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one (2)\n\nAmorphous powder (1.8 mg); [_a_]D +30 (_c_ 0.25, MeOH); UV _l_max (CH3OH) nm (log _e_): 240 (4.0); IR _v_max (KBr) cm-1 : 3732, 1629, 1030.

The structures of the isolated lignans were elucidated by interpretation of their spectroscopic data, including by gHMQC and gHMBC. The relative and absolute configurations of the isolates were determined from NOESY interactions and optical properties, respectively. Four of the lignans were diastereomeric whilst one was of mixed biosynthetic origin. All but one of the lignans exhibited high _in vitro_ trypanocidal activity when assayed against epimastigotes of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ strain Y.\n\nkeywords: _Peperonia blanda_; Piperaceae; Tetrahydrofuran lignans; Structural elucidation; Trypanocidal activity +\nFootnote †: journal:\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nChagas disease is one of the most widespread of tropical diseases, being endemic in 21 countries, with some 16-18 million individuals infected and a further 100 million people at risk (Molfetta et al., 2005; Pozas et al., 2005).\n\nSignificant antiprotozoan activities have recently been reported for a number of lignans derived from members of the Piperaceae family (Martins et al., 2003; Luize et al., 2006). This family, which is included among the basal angiosperms and can be found in the tropics mainly as pioneer plants, has been the subject of numerous phytochemical investigations. The major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Parmar et al., 1997; Benevides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Moreira et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005).\n\n_Piper_ and _Peperonia_ represent the most important genera of the Piperaceae family with 2000 (Wanke et al., 2006) and 1700 species (Quijano-Abril et al., 2006), respectively. Species of _Peperonia_ are well known as ornamental plants and have found application in folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, asthma and gastric ulcers, and as analgesic and antibacterial agents (Arrigon-Blank et al., 2004). The major classes of compounds present in the relatively few species of _Peperonia_ that have been investigated are prenylated phenols and benzoic acids (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Seeram et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998; Salazar et al., 2005), and also dibenzylbutarolactone and dibenzylbutanediol lignans (Li et al., 2006).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAdditionally, several lignans (Li et al., 2007) and unusual seco- and nor-lignans have also been described (Bayma et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006). More recently, two new tetrahydrofuran lignans were isolated from _Peperomia pellucida_ (Xu et al., 2006) and thus a phenylprognoid-based lineage for the _Peperomia_ species can be supported.\n\n_Peperomia blanda_ H.B. & K. is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet rock crevices (Guimaraes and Giordano, 2004). At the present time, information is only available concerning the essential oil (Santos et al., 2001) and two chromenes isolated from the non-polar fraction of the aerial parts of the species (Velozo et al., 2006). In the present work, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of four new tetrahydrofuran lignan stereoisomers and a new tetrahydrofuran lignan of mixed biosynthetic origin. The antitripanosomal properties of these novel lignans have been determined.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe EtOAc extract derived from aerial parts of _P. blanda_ was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 was fractionated chromatography to yield five lignans **1-5**; (Fig. 1) and two flavones (**6** and **7**). The 1H NMR spectra of compounds **1-4** were characteristic of non-symmetric tetrahydrofuran lignans since each exhibited a pair of doublets at \\(d\\) 0.63 +- 0.05 (CH3-9) and 1.04 +- 0.04 (CH3-9') corresponding to methyl groups, a second set of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.03 +- 0.02 (H-7) and 4.32 +- 0.03 (H-7') that were assignable to oxybenzyl methine groups, and multiplets at \\(d\\) 2.18 +- 0.03 and 1.69 +- 0.03 associated, respectively, with the H8 and H8' protons. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data corroborated the presence of the tetrahydrofuran system in each case, and all signals were assigned accordingly based on HMBC data (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nAs previously reported (Biftu and Stevenson, 1987; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989), the coupling constants of 8.5 and 9.0 Hz for the doublet at \\(d\\) 5.05, and of 4.33 Hz for H-7 and H-7' indicate that these hydrogens are in a _trans_ configuration with the adjacent H-8 and H-8' in a tetrahydrofuran ring. Differential NOE experiments (Fig. 2) confirmed the relative stereochemistry of all of the lignans isolated. Thus, as for lignan 3, H-7 showed clear NOE correlations with H-7' and H-8, H-7' correlated with H-7, H-8 and H-9', and H-8' correlated with H-9 confirming the _trans_ configuration of the adjacent H-8 and H-8' and a _cis_ configuration between H-7 and H-7'.\n\nThe differences observed in the NMR spectra of compounds **1-4** were due to different substitution patterns in the aromatic ring. The molecular formula of lignan 1 was established as C22H26O7 by HRMS. The aromatic moieties were determined to be syringyl and 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups on the following basis: (i) two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.49 (_s_, 2H) correlated to H7 in the HMBC spectrum, (ii) aromatic carbons C3 and C5 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.80) and to H2/H6, and (iii) the second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at \\(d\\) 6.61 (H2') and 6.64 (H6'), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-4' and C-7' in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, **1** was established as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S-4-hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,5,3'-trimethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan_.\n\nCompound **2** showed a molecular formula of C23H28O7 by HRMS. 1H NMR spectra indicated two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.48 (_s_, 2H) correlating to H7 in the HMBC spectrum and aromatic carbons C3, C5 at \\(d\\) 152.8 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.77) and to H2/H6 and subsequently, C4 at \\(d\\) 136.6 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.76). The second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at \\(d\\) 6.61 (H2') and 6.64 (H6'), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-4' and C-7' in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, **2** was identified as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S)-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,3'-tetramethylenedioxy-7,7'-epoxylignan, i.e., a methylated derivative of **1**.\n\nThe molecular formula of **3** was determined to be C23H30O7 by HRMS, and the aromatic moieties were identified as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylophenyl groups. The aromatic singlets at \\(d\\) 6.49 and 6.67 were assigned to separate aromatic groups, since the HMBC showed correlation to H7 (_d_ 5.03) and H7' (_d_ 4.34), respectively. The remaining correlations between C3/C3', C4/C4' and C5/C5' perfectly matched those of H2/H2'and H6/H6'. Thus compound **3** was determined as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S)-4'-hydroxy-3,4,5,3',5'-pentamethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan_.\n\nCompound **4** showed the molecular formula C22H24O7 by HRMS, and both aromatic moieties were identified as 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups for the signals at \\(d\\) 5.97 (_s_, 2H) and \\(d\\) 5.96 (_s_, 2H) due to methylenedioxyphenyl groups connected to C4/C5 and C4'/C5', respectively. At \\(d\\) 3.93 (_s_, 3H) and \\(d\\) 3.90 (_s_, 3H) are the resonances of two methoxyl groups correlated to C3 and C3'.\n\nFig. 1: Tetrahydrofuran lignans isolated from the aerial parts of _Peperomia blanda_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe identity of **4** was thus established as _rel_-(7\\(R\\),8\\(S\\),7_'S_,8_'S_)-4,5_,4_'_,5_'_-dimethylenedioxy-3,3'_-dimethoxy-7,7'_-_-_epoxysilignan.\n\nThe molecular formula of **5** was established as C23H28O8 by HRMS. The compound differed from lignans **1-4** in respect to a hydroxyl group linked to C-9. The presence of this group was deduced from various sources: the IR spectrum (absorption at 3450 cm-1), from the 1H NMR by signals at \\(d\\) 3.40 (2H, m), from the 13C NMR both from resonances at \\(d\\) 62.5 and the presence of only one methyl group (_d_ 1.08; \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz), and from the HMBC, which showed connectivity between the H9 protons and C7. Thus, **5** was determined as _rel_-(7\\(R\\),8\\(S\\),7_'S_,8_'S_)-9-hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,3'-tetramethoxy-7,7'-\n\nepoxylignan.\n\nThe known flavones 5-hydroxy-4',7,8-trimethoxyflavone (**6**) and 5-hydroxy-3',4',7,8-tetramethylaxone (**7**) were also identified in the extract derived from the aerial parts of _P. blanda_. These compounds have been previously isolated from _Peperomia sui_ (Cheng et al., 2003).\n\nCompounds **1-5** were submitted to bioassay against epimastigotes of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ strain Y and the respective IC50 values are shown in Table 3. All of the lignans exhibited potent trypanocidal activity. Compound **4**, bearing two methylenedioxyphenyl groups, was more\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline C & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 132.2 & 137.0 & 136.7 & 135.4 & 134.9 \\\\\n2 & 103.8 & 104.5 & 104.2 & 106.6 & 103.5 \\\\\n3\n\n## Page 4\n\nactive than other lignans possessing one or no methylenedioxyphenyl group.\n\n### Concluding remarks\n\nIn this work, we describe the isolation and structural elucidation of five new tetrahydrofuran lignans from the aerial part of _P. blanda_. The trypanocidal activity of these compounds was evaluated against epimastigotes of _T. cruzi_ strain Y. All of the isolates showed potent activity when compared with the positive control benzidazole.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General\n\n\\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HREIMS were measured using a Bruker Daltronics model ultraTOFo ESI-TOF instrument. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar model SD-1 LC/UV/VIS chromatograph equipped with a Supelcosil C-18 reversed phase column (250 x 21.2 mm; Supelco). IR spectra were measured in KBr pellets in a Perkin-Elmer Infrared spectrometer FTIR series 1600. Optical rotations were measured at \\(\\lambda = 589\\) nm in a digital polarimeter JASCO model DIP-370. UV spectra were recorded in MeOH using a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer. Separations by CC were carried out using silica gel (230-400 mesh; Merck). All solvents were redistilled prior to use.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe aerial parts of _P. blanda_ were collected at the Reserva da Ripasa, Ibate - SP, Brazil in January of 2005 and identified by Dra. Elsie Franklin Guimaraes. A voucher specimen (Kato-547) has been deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Biociencias, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo - SP, Brazil.\n\n### Isolation of compounds\n\nDried aerial parts (86 g) of _P. blanda_ were milled, extracted with EtOAc (1.2 L) for 4 hours at room temperature, and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude extract (8.5 g). This extract was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 (1.95 g) was submitted to CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc to yield fractions 1-14. The precipitate present in fraction 3 (420 mg) was purified by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound **6** (6.3 mg), whilst the soluble part was submitted to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc producing subfractions 3-1 to 3-60. Subfractions 3-20 (12 mg) and 3-43 (46 mg) afforded compounds **4** and **2**, respectively. Fraction 4 (220 mg) was submitted to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc providing subfractions 4-1 to 4-37. Subfraction 4-23 (98 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (72:28) to afford compound **1** (8.6 mg). The precipitate present in fraction 6 (103 mg) was purified by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound **7** (8.0 mg). Fraction 7 (350 mg) was subjected to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc resulting in subfractions 7-1 to 7-167. Subfraction 7-140 afforded compound **5** (7 mg). Subfraction 7-79 (95.0 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (2:3) to yield five fractions, the penultimate of which afforded compound **3** (17 mg).\n\n### rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S)-4-Hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,5,3'-trimethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan (1)\n\nPale yellow oil, \\([\\alpha]_{\\text{D}}^{21}-52.8\\) (MeOH; \\(c\\) 0.125).

In vitro bioassays\n\nThe biological assays with epimastigote forms of _T. cruzi_ strain Y were performed as described previously (Bernacchi et al., 2002). Tetrahydrofuran lignans and benzmidazole (Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were stored as 1.0 mg ml\\({}^{-1}\\) stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and were serially diluted (1:3) prior to use with liver-infusion tryptose (LIT) medium to provide concentrations of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg ml\\({}^{-1}\\), each in triplicate. The number of viable protozoa was determined by counting in a Neubauer chamber after 72 h incubation at 28 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC\\({}_{50}\\)) values were calculated by fitting a nonlinear regression curve (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) and comparing with those of benzmidazole, the positive control. A one-way ANOVA test was used to establish the significance level of the activity corresponding to each compound evaluated in the _in vitro_ assay.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) with Grants 03/11524-9 and 05/57042-0, and also as part of the Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (BIOTA/FAPESP - [http://www.bio-tasp.org.br](http://www.bio-tasp.org.br)).

Ximenes, Mariana G. Lopes, Maicon Segalla Petronio, Luis Octavio Regasin, Dulce H. Siqueira Silva, Luiz M. da Fonseca\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe protective effect of gallic acid and its esters, methyl, propyl, and lauryl gallate, against _2,2'_-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH)-induced hemolysis and depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in erythrocytes was studied. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent, and the esters were significantly more effective than gallic acid. Gallic acid and its esters were compared with regard to their reactivity to free radicals, using the DPPH and AAPH/pyranine free-cell assays, and no significant difference was obtained. Gallic acid and its esters not only failed to inhibit the depletion of intracellular GSH in erythrocytes induced by AAPH but exacerbated it. Similarly, the oxidation of GSH by AAPH or horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in cell-free systems was exacerbated by gallic acid or gallates. This property could be involved in the recent findings on pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidant activities of gallates in tumor cells. We provide evidence that lipophilicity and not only radical scavenger potency is an important factor regarding the efficiency of anti-hemolytic substances.\n\nGallic acid; gallates; erythrocytes; hemolysis; glutathione; peroxyl radical; antioxidant; pro-oxidant activity\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nGallic acid and its derivatives are among the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in wines and green tea (_I_ - _3_). This phytochemical is well-known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and chemopreventive properties (_t_ - _7_). The similar beneficial effects of the synthetic esters of gallic acid have been extensively studied, and in many cases, they are stronger than those of gallic acid itself. For instance, lauryl gallate (dodecyl gallate), a widely used food additive, is more efficient than gallic acid as an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, and of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by FeIII-NADPH (_d_). Methyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid at inhibiting oral bacterial growth and the formation of _Streptococcus mutans_ biofilms (_4_). Methyl gallate inhibits the production of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2 by bone-marrow-derived mast cells (_th_). Nonyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid against the growth of _Salmonella choleraeus_ (_10_). Lauryl gallate protects against the formation of dimethylbenzanthracene-induced skin tumors in mice and kills, selectively, tumor cells in established tumors (_11_). Such biological activities have been correlated with the amphipathic feature of these ester derivatives (_12_), because the _in vitro_ antioxidant potential is nearly the same as that of gallic acid. Hence, it may be supposed that the accessibility of the gallates to the intracellular medium could be a determining factor for their effects.\n\nAnother relevant property of gallates is their pro-oxidant characteristics. Indeed, the cytotoxic effect of octyl, dodecyl, and tetracdexy gallates on melanoma cells has recently been demonstrated (_13, 14_). This biological effect has been associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of NF-_k_B, inhibition of cell adhesion, and alteration of the cell redox status by depletion of both glutathione (GSH) and ATP (_13_). Similarly, the inhibition of HeLa cell growth by propyl gallate was associated with depletion of intracellular GSH and increased production of the superoxide anion (_14_).\n\nThe hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an _ex vivo_ model for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced disruption of cell membranes and the protective effect of antioxidants. One of the most frequently studied models uses the water-soluble azo compound 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), which decomposes at physiological temperature (37 degC)\n\n## Page 2\n\nto generate an alkyl radical (R*). In the presence of dissolved molecular oxygen, this radical is converted to the corresponding peroxyl radical (ROO*) (_15_). The mechanism of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by thermolysis of AAPH is not completely understood, but it has been correlated with lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins (_16_). The incubation of erythrocytes with AAPH also provokes the depletion of intracellular GSH (_17_).\n\nBecause the above biological phenomenon is associated with the disruption of the cell membrane and in view of increasing evidence that the lipophilicity of gallic acid esters is decisive for their beneficial effects, here, we aimed to synthesize selected gallate esters and compare their efficacy as inhibitors of AAPH-induced hemolysis and GSH depletion. The objective was to retain the same oxidizable moiety while altering the lipophilicity. Additionally, we studied and compared the antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of gallic acid and gallates in cell-free systems.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Chemicals and Equipments.\n\nGallic acid, vanillic acid, methyl vanillate, (+-)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), _N_-ethylmaleimide (NEM), (+-)-a-tocopherol (vitamin E), 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), 5,5'-dithioish(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), glutathione (GSH), 8-hydroxypropyl-2,3,6-trisulfin acid trisulfin salt (pyramine), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picylhydrazyl (DPPH), \\(N\\),N_-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, amine hydroperoxide (Cu-OOH), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1), and _o_-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was prepared by diluting a 30% stock solution and calculating its concentration from its absorption at 240 nm (_ε_240 = 43.6 M-1 cm-1) (_18_). Column chromatography was carried out over 0.06-0.20 mm silica gel (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out in a Varian Prep-Star 400 system with a Phenomex C-18 (250 x 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Iowa 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz ('H) and 125 MHz ('C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-_d\n\n## Page 3\n\n37 degC. When present, apocynin, gallic acid, and gallates (100 _m_M) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 _ng_/mL catalase. The concentration of GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection, as previously described (2): For GSH determination, 50 _m_L of the above reaction mixture was added to 1.0 mL of 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. To a 20 _m_L aliquot of this mixture, 300 _m_L of 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0 and 20 _m_L of 0.1% OPA in methanol were added as this reaction mixture was incubated at 25 degC for 15 min in the dark in well-capped tubes, after which 20 _m_L of each sample was injected into the HPLC system. For GSSG determination, a 200 _m_L aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 degC with 200 _m_L of 40 mM NEM, for 25 min, in the dark, to react with the GSH present in the sample. To this mixture, 750 _m_L of 0.1 M NaOH was added. A 20 _m_L portion of this mixture was taken for measurement of GSSG, using the procedure outlined above for the GSH assay, except that 0.1 M NaOH was employed as the diluent rather than 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. The HPLC method for the determination of GSH and GSSG is based on derivatization with OPA to form a stable, highly fluorescent derivative (2). The derivatives of GSH and GSSG were separated by liquid chromatography (Varian ProStar in line with a fluorescence detector set at 350/420 nm). The analyses were carried out isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 _m_m). The mobile phase consisted of 15% methanol in 25 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 6.0 (flow rate of 0.5 mL/min).\n\n### Measurement of Oxygen Consumption.\n\nThe consumption of dissolved molecular oxygen during the oxidation of GSH was monitored in a YSI 5300A oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring, OH). The reaction mixture of 1 mM GSH, 100 _m_H2O2, and 0.1 _m_M HRP in PBS was incubated at 37 degC in the presence or absence (control) of 10 _m_M apocynin or gallates. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. The oxygen consumption was monitored for 10 min.\n\nPyranaine-Based Procedure for Evaluation of the Reactivity of Gallates with Peroxyl Radicals Generated by AAPH Thermolysis.\n\nThis experiment was performed as described by Lissi et al. (2_d_), with minor modifications. The experiments were based on the decay in the fluorescence of pyramine when it was submitted to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compound pyramine (5 _m_M) was incubated with 20 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 degC in the absence (control) or presence of gallates in the wells of a microplate. The fluorescence bleaching of the pyramine was monitored at _dx_= 460 nm and _x_= 510 nm in a Spectramax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The final reaction volume was 300 _m_L. The flag phase (induction time) obtained when the antioxidants were present was measured for various concentrations of each gallate. The slopes of the curves of induction time versus concentration were used to measure the relative reactivity of the gallates with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals.\n\n### Free-Radical Scavenging Activity on DPPH/DPPH Bleaching Assay.\n\nThe free-radical scavenger activity of gallic acid and its esters was compared by the DPPH bleaching assay (5). The antioxidants were incubated for 30 min with 100 _m_M DPPH in methyl alcohol in the dark. The scavenger activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm, using the absorbance of the unreacted DPPH radical as the control. The scavenger activity was calculated as ((absorbance of the control - absorbance of the sample)/absorbance of the control) x 100.\n\n## Results\n\nWe studied the hemolysis of erythrocytes and the protective effect of gallic acid and its esters. The molecular structures of the compounds studied are shown in **Figure 1**. Hemolysis was provoked by thermolysis of the azo compound AAPH, which generates a low but constant flux of peroxyl radicals when incubated at 37 degC (_15_). **Figure 2** shows the kinetic profile of hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid and propyl gallate. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent (Figure 3), and the esters methyl gallate (G1), propyl gallate (G3), and lauryl gallate (G12) were more effective inhibitors than their acid precursor, gallic acid (G0) (**Table 1**).\n\nBecause the above results suggest a higher efficacy of the esters as free-radical scavengers, we also compared their relative potency in cell-free models. First, they were compared as scavengers of the stable free-radical DPPH. The results depicted in **Table 2** show that no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its ester derivatives. In a second set of experiments, we studied the direct reactivity of gallic acid and its esters with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. In this assay, the relative reactivity of the antioxidants with peroxyl radicals is determined by the lag phase in the decay of pyramine fluorescence (2_d_). **Figure 4** shows the typical time profile of the bleaching obtained when pyramine was incubated with AAPH in the presence of gallic acid and methyl gallate. The linear relation between the delay and the concentration of gallic acid or gallates was used to measure the reactivity of the tested compound with AAPH. In this design, the slope of the curve is directly proportional to the efficiency of the antioxidant as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals. **Figure 4** also shows the typical linear correlation between the concentration and lag phase for gallic acid and methyl gallate. The slopes obtained were 442 +- 30 for gallic acid, 499 +- 31 for methyl gallate, 453 +- 6 for propyl gallate, and 187 +- 7 for lauryl gallate (mean +- SEM, \\(n\\) = 3). As can be observed, only lauryl gallate presented a\n\nFigure 1.: Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study.\n\nFigure 2.: AAPH-induced hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3). The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 °C. The results are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of duplicates of three separate experiments.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\ndecreased reactivity with peroxyl radicals in this experimental model.\n\nConsidering the above cell-free studies, the stronger antihemolytic effect of the gallates, relative to that of gallic acid, suggests that lipophilicity is a determining factor in this experimental model. To verify this proposal, we also compared the antioxidant vanillic acid versus its methyl ester (methyl vanillate) and trolox, a more water-soluble form of vitamin E, versus vitamin E itself. The results with these two different classes of antioxidants followed the same pattern as that for gallates and gallic acid, reinforcing the suggestion that lipophilicity of antioxidants is crucial with respect to antihemolytic protection (**Table 1**).\n\nThe direct hemolytic capacity of gallic acid and gallates was also investigated, because these compounds could interact with and disrupt the erythrocyte membrane. In these experiments, gallic acid and gallates were incubated with erythrocytes without AAPH. The results in **Table 3** show that only the 12-carbon ester lauryl gallate caused significant hemolysis after incubation for 6 h.\n\nThe protective effect of gallates was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis. The results given in **Table 4** show that gallates were also effective when the hemolysis was provoked by incubation of erythrocytes with cumene hydroperoxide. Again, there was a correlation with lipophilicity.\n\nIn a further experiment, the protective effect of gallic acid and gallates on the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by AAPH was also studied. Despite their antimobutyric properties, gallic acid and gallates were unable to inhibit the oxidation of GSH when erythrocytes were incubated with AAPH. On the contrary, the depletion of GSH was exacerbated by methyl and lauryl gallates (**Table 5**).\n\nTo clarify these findings, we studied the direct reaction between pure GSH and AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and tested the effect of gallic acid and gallates on this reaction. Again, the presence of gallic acid and gallates tended to exacerbate the oxidation of GSH (**Figure 5**).\n\nIn another set of experiments, pure GSH was oxidized by H2O3 in a reaction catalyzed by HRP. Because GSH is a poor substrate for peroxidase, the efficiency of oxidation was low (26). However, the addition of gallic acid and gallates caused a strong increase in the oxidation of GSH (**Figure 6**).\n\nIt is well-known that some phenolic compounds are able to act as a co-catalyst in reactions of inefficient peroxidase substrates, such as GSH. In such situations, the oxidized intermediate phenolic radical is reduced back and GSH is converted to GSSG. Moreover, during this redox cycle, the dissolved molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture is consumed, being reduced to superoxide anion (27). For these reasons and in light of our results, we measured the production of GSSG and the oxygen consumption as GSH was oxidized by HRP/H2O2 in the presence of gallic acid or gallates. To ascertain whether our experimental conditions for assessing the co-catalytic effect of phenols upon the oxidation of GSH was correct, we used apocynin, which is able to initiate this process, as a reference compound (28). As can be seen in **Figure 7**, both gallic acid and apocynin exacerbated the oxidation of GSH; however, only in the presence of apocynin was GSSG obtained as a product. Similarly, only in the presence of apocynin was the consumption of dissolved oxygen observed (**Figure 8**). The other gallates showed the same results as gallic acid (data not shown).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an _ex vivo_ model in the study of ROS-induced disruption of cell membranes. The inhibitory property of many antioxidants upon AAPH-induced hemolysis is well-documented (29-32). However, there is no clear relationship between the molecular structure of the antioxidants and their efficiency as inhibitors. Here, working with gallic acid and its ester derivatives, we found\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline experimental condition & percent hemolysis (3 h) & percent hemolysis (6 h) \\\\ \\(-\\)AAPH & \\(2 \\pm 1^{6}\\) & \\(3 \\pm 1^{6}\\) \\\\  & \\(17 \\pm 3^{6}\\) & \\(78 \\pm 7^{6}\\) \\\\  +G0 & \\(3 \\pm 2^{d}\\) & \\(72 \\pm 6\\) \\\\  +G1 & \\(3 \\pm 2^{d}\\) & \\(18 \\pm 5^{d}\\) \\\\  +G3 & \\(2 \\pm 1^{d}\\) & \\(9 \\pm 4^{d}\\) \\\\ +AAPH & +G12 & \\(\n\n## Page 5\n\nthat lipophilicity seems to be an essential characteristic of an efficient antihemolytic compound. Similar findings were reported by Wu et al. that ranked the antihemolytic efficiency of gallates as propyl > ethyl > methyl (_33_). Corroborating this proposal, the correlation between efficacy against AAPH-induced hemolysis and lipophilicity was not restricted to gallic acid and its ester derivatives but extended to other classes of molecules, such as vanillic acid versus its lipophilic derivative methyl vanillate and trolox versus vitamin E. Moreover, the benefit of lipophilicity was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis, because it was also seen when the erythrocytes were challenged with cumene hydroperoxide.\n\nReinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, our result showed clearly that higher antihemolytic efficacy of the gallates was not related to their oxidizability. Indeed, except for lauryl gallate, no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its esters in their potential as antioxidants in cell-free systems. Only the 12-carbon chain ester was relatively poor as a peroxyl radical scavenger in the cell-free systems. Despite that and again reinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, lauryl gallate was a more efficient inhibitor of hemolysis than gallic acid.\n\nIt is important to observe that any compound used as an antihemolytic agent when erythrocytes are challenged by free\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline experimental condition & percent hemolysis (2 h) \\\\ \\hline –Qu–OOH & & 8.1 ± 4.9a \\\\  & & 72.9 ± 1.6a \\\\  & 10 & 67 ± 1.7 \\\\  & +60 (_μM_) & 20 & 17 ± 6.9a \\\\  & +G1 (_μM_) & 10 & 11.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nradicals could also interact directly with the cell membrane and provoke its disruption. This effect has been described, and there is a relationship between lipophilicity and hemolytic capacity developed by many compounds [34, 35]. Accordingly, lauryl gallate, the most lipophilic compound used in this study, was the only ester capable of inducing hemolysis of erythrocytes under our experimental conditions.\n\nOther important findings include the interaction of gallic acid and gallates with GSH. This chemical feature could explain or be involved in the recent findings about cellular pro-oxidant effects of gallates [13, 14]. This tripeptide is the main endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) reflects directly the redox status of the cell [36]. It is well-known that redox homeostasis is crucial for cells to survive, and the pathophysiological mechanisms of several diseases are related to the exacerbated production of ROS and/or decreased antioxidant functions [37]. In fact, apoptosis, which is altered in tumor cells, strongly depends upon the GSH/GSSG ratio [38, 39]. Two pathways could explanation the exacerbated oxidation of GSH when gallates are present in the reaction mixture or cellular medium. The first is the action of these compounds as co-catalysts, where the intermediate phenoxyl radical would be reduced back to gallate with concomitant oxidation of GSH. This phenomenon is well-established for phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine and apocynin [27, 28], and the consequence of this redox cycle is the consumption of GSH, the formation of GSSG, and the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion [40]. This was exactly what we observed for apocynin, used as a model for a comparison to gallates in this study. However, when gallates were used, the consumption of GSH was not followed by the formation of GSSG and the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Hence, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for the augmented depletion of GSH caused by gallic acid and gallates.\n\nThe second possible explanation for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates in the depletion of intracellular GSH is a chemical reaction between the oxidized trihydroxybenzene moiety, probably in its quinone form, and GSH via the Michael\n\nFigure 5.: Oxidation of GSH by BAPH and effect of gallic acid and gallates. The reaction system (positive control) consisted of 2.5 mM AAPH and 100 _μ_M GSH in PBS, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. When present, the gallates were 100 _μ_M. The results are mean ± SEM of duplicates of five separate experiments.

This is a well-known reaction that involves electrophilic quinones and nucleophilic substances, such as GSH, leading to thiol adducts (_41_, _42_). In this case, the consumption of GSH is not followed by the formation of GSSG and oxygen consumption, as verified here. In summary, **Scheme 1** shows our proposal for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates when these compounds were oxidized in the presence of GSH, which could explain the depletion of intracellular GSH as verified here and by others (_13_, _14_).\n\n## Literature Cited\n\n* (1) Bertelli, A.

Additionally, 19 known compounds such as benzoic acids, chromenes, and flavonoids were isolated and identified. The antifungal activity of these compounds was evaluated by bioautographic TLC assay against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphareospermum_.\n\nPapercase species have been extensively investigated as a source of new natural products with potential anti-tumoral, antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal activities.1-3 The phytochemical profile in _Piper_ species is characterized by the production of typical classes of compounds such as amides, benzoic acids, and chromenes in addition to ligaments, neoligans, and a few alkaloids.4-6\n\nAs part of our research aiming to uncover new antifungal compounds in Brazilian Piperaceae species, we have previously reported the occurrence of pyrrolidine amides in _P. hispidum_7 and piperidine, isobutyl, and pyrrolidine amides in _P. tuberculatum_8 and _P. arboreum_.9 Additionally, anti-fungal preyniled hydroquinones and flavances from leaves of _P. crassinervium_10 have been described as well. The search for new antifungal compounds will contribute to establish a model for further investments in this field in order to preserve, to study, and to exploit rationally the remaining flora of Sao Paulo State.\n\nIn the course of the Biota Program ([http://www.biota.sp](http://www.biota.sp)), a large number of _Piper_ species collected in the state of Sao Paulo had their extracts assayed by means of bioautography using _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries and _C. sphareospermum_ (Perzig). Since the extracts of _Piper crassinervium_ Kunth, _P. aduncum_ L., _P. hostmannianum_ (Miquel) C. DC., and _P. gaudichaudianum_ Kunth showed high growth inhibitory activity, they were subjected to dereplication procedures using chromatographic techniques associated with the bioautographic assay. Thus, the major aim of this paper is to describe the isolation and structural determination of the new antifungal compounds from Piperaceae species.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe MeOH extract from leaves of _P. crassinervium_ yielded three prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acids [4-hydroxy-3-(3, 7-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-1-oxo-6-oetenyl)benzoic acid (crassinervic acid, 1), 4-hydroxy-(3, 7-dimethyl-1-oxo-octa-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (2), and 4-hydroxy-(3, 7-dimethyl-1-oxo-octa-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid12 (3,4,5-trimethoxydihydrocinnamic acid12 (4), 1,4-dihydroxy-2-(3, 7-dimethyl-1-oxo-octa-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzene10 (5), and two flavanones [5,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxyflavanone13 (naringenin 4-methyl ether, 6) and 5,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-flavanone14 (sakuranetin, 7)].\n\nThe CH2Cl2- and hexane-soluble parts of the MeOH extract of the leaves of _P. aduncum_ yielded one new prenylated benzoic acid [methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3-methyl-1-oxo-2-butenyl)benzoate (aduncumene, 8)], four known chromenes [methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (9), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (11), and 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid15,16 (12)], 4-methoxy-3-(3, 7-dimethylocta-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), and two dihydrechalcone [2,6-dihydroxy-4-methyl-oxdithydrochalcone15 (14) and piperaduncine B17 (15)].\n\nThe CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves of _P. hostmannianum_ yielded methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), three prenylated methyl hydroxybenzoate derivatives [methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)benzoate18,19 (16), methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-hydroxy-3-butenyl)benzoate16 (17), and the new derivative methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-2-3)-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)benzoate (hostmannienne, 18)], and pinoembrin20,21 (19).\n\nThe CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves and roots of _P. gaudichaudianum_ yielded two chromenes [2-methyl-2-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (gaudichaudianic acid, 20) and methyl 2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (21)], three prenylated benzoic acids [4-methoxy-3-(3, 7-dimethylocta-2-E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), 4-hydroxy-3-(3, 7-dimethylocta-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid23 (22), and methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-1-oxo-2-butenyl)benzoate24 (methyl taboangante, 23)], and pinoembrin20,21 (19).\n\nCompound **1** was isolated from the leaves of _P. crassinervium_ as a white amorphous solid. Its molecular formula was established as C17:H2O5 by analysis of its HREIMS spectrum (_m/z_ 306.1459, called 306.1467). The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3380 cm-1), two carbonyl groups (1696, 1611 cm-1), and an aromatic ring (1489, 1421 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited signals\n\n## Page 2\n\nfor three aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.93 (d, \\(J\\) = 8.9 Hz), 8.11 (dd, \\(J\\) = 8.9 and 2.4 Hz), and 8.56 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.4 Hz), indicative of a 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. Additional signals included three methyl singlets (_d_ 1.37, 1.50, 1.58), two doublets at \\(d\\) 2.77 (1H, \\(J\\) = 16.5 Hz) and 2.64 (1H, \\(J\\) = 16.5 Hz), characteristic of an isolated \\(\\alpha\\)-carbonyl methylene group, and a triplet at \\(d\\) 4.98 (1H, \\(J\\) = 7.2 Hz), indicating the presence of a double bond in the side chain. The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEDT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) showed signals for 17 carbon atoms assigned as two carbonyl (_d_ 191.5, 170.6), six aromatic (_d_ 163.7, 137.3, 129.9, 122.1, 119.9, 118.8), two olefinic (_d_ 132.5, 122.9), three methyl (_d_ 25.6, 23.9, 17.5), one tertiary carboninic (_d_ 82.3), and three aliphatic methylene carbons (_d_ 47.2, 39.3, 22.2). The assignments of the signals for aromatic carbons were based on comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data reported for known benzoic acids analogues.11 The connectivity between aromatic and aliphatic moieties was revealed by analysis of the HMDC spectrum. The correlations between signals at \\(d\\) 8.56 (H-2)/2.77 (H-2)/2.64 (H-2 b) with 191.5 (C-1 ) as well as between \\(d\\) 8.56 (H-2)/8.11 (H-6) with 170.6 (CO2H) (Figure 1) indicated that compound **1** contains one carbonyl group at C-1 and one carboxyl group attached to C-1. The double bond at the side chain was assigned on the basis of the observed cross-peaks between \\(d\\) 4.98 (H-6 ) and 25.6 (C-8 )/17.5 (C-9 ) in the HMDC spectrum and between signals at \\(d\\) 4.98 (H-6 ), 2.03 (H-5 ), 1.58 (H-8 ), and 1.50 (H-9 ) in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Thus, the hydroxyl group on a tertiary carbon atom was placed at C-3  of the side chain, in agreement with the HMDC correlations observed between the hydrogen signals at \\(d\\) 2.77 (H-2 a)/2.64 (H-2 b), 1.70 (H-4 ), and 1.37 (H-10 ) with the carbon signal at \\(d\\) 82.3 (C-3 ). Analysis of the DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMDC NMR spectra allowed full assignment for all hydrogen and carbon atoms, and thus, the structure of exrasineric acid (**1**) was elucidated as 4-hydroxy-3-(3, 7 -dimethyl-3 -hydroxy-1 -oxo-6 -octenyl)benzoic acid.\n\nCompound **8** was isolated from the leaves of _P. aduncum_ as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula C14H16O4 was determined by LRESIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 1700, 1610, and at 1445 cm-1, assignable to two carbonyl groups and aromatic double bonds, respectively. The structure of the premylated benzoic acid derivative was recognized by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum, which showed signals at \\(d\\) 8.18 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 8.06 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 8.5 and 1.9 Hz), and 6.93 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz). This spectrum also showed a set of signals including two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.96 (3H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.5 Hz)/2.20 (3H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.5 Hz) and a multiplet at 6.53 (1H), which are characteristics of an isoprene unit, and additionally, two methoxyl groups at \\(d\\) 3.90 (3H, s) and 3.86 (3H, s). The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEDT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) exhibited, in the low-field region, one carbonechloronyl group at \\(d\\) 166.6, six aromatic carbons at \\(d\\) 161.2, 134.1, 132.0, 131.2, 122.9, 111.4, and two signals corresponding to the double-bond carbons at \\(d\\) 125.1 (CH) and 156.7 (C). These two signals, associated with the carbonyl signal at \\(d\\) 192.7, indicated an \\(a\\),_b_/unsaturated carbonyl system.22,25\\({}^{\\circ}\\) The high-field region exhibited signals assignable to two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 28.3 and 21.6 and two methoxyl groups at \\(d\\) 52.5 and 56.2. The assignment of all signals observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of **8** was corroborated by HMQC and HMDC experiments (Figure 1). The HMDC spectrum showed the correlation of the signal at \\(d\\) 192.2 (C-1 ) with the hydrogens at \\(d\\) 8.18 (H-6), 8.06 (H-4), and 6.53 (H-2 ) and between \\(d\\) 166.6 (C-6 ) and 8.18 (H-6) and also with 3.86 (OCH3). Finally, the cross-peaks observed between \\(d\\) 156.7 (C-3 ) and 2.20 (H-4 ) and 1.96 (H-5 ) confirmed the structure of **8** as methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3 -methyl-1 -oxo-2 -butenyl)benzoate, named aduncumene.\n\nCompound **18** was obtained from the leaves of _P. host-mannianum_, as a white amorphous powder. Its LRESIMS data associated with 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) and elemental analysis indicated a molecular formula of C13H18O5. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3463 cm-1), an aromatic ring (1613, 1440 cm-1), and a carbonyl group (1715 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals assignable to three coupled aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.76 (d, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz), 7.72 (dd, \\(J\\) = 9.0 and 2.0 Hz), and 7.77 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz), characteristic of the 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. In addition, this spectrum displayed three singlets at \\(d\\) 1.27 (3H), 1.30 (3H), and 3.80 (3H) assigned, respectively, to two methyl groups attached to an oxygen-bearing carbon and to one methoxyl group. The presence of an oxymethine hydrogen at \\(d\\) 3.77 (dd, \\(J\\) = 6.0 and 4.5 Hz), associated with the signals at \\(d\\) 3.02 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 17.0 and 4.5 Hz) and 2.73 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 17.0 and 6.0 Hz), suggested a hydroxylated isoprene side chain at C-3 of the benzoic acid nucleus. The HMDC spectrum of **18** (Figure 1) showed correlation between the signals at \\(d\\) 31.1 (C-1 ) and 7.77 (H-2), between \\(d\\) 69.2 (C-2 ) and 1.27 (H-4 /1.30 (H-5 )/0.2 (H-1 a)/2.73\n\n## Page 3\n\n(H-1 b), between d 25.0 (C-4 ) and 1.30 (H-5 ), and between d 22.0 (C-5 ) and 3.77 (H-2 J/1.27 (H-4 ), confirming the positioning of the vicinal hydroxyl groups at C-2 and C-3. The methoxy group was determined as a methyl ester, considering that a cross-peak between the signals at d 166.9 (C-6 ) and 3.80 (OCH3) was observed in the HMBC spectrum. Therefore, the structure of **18** was determined as methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2, 3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)benzoate, named homaminase.\n\nCompound **20** was isolated from the leaves of _P. gaudiachaadium_ as an amorphous solid. The molecular formula C22H28O3 was deduced by LREIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3500, 1681, and 1601 cm-1 assignable to a hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic ring, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at d 5.58 (1H, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz) and d 6.38 (1H, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz) and four singlets at d 1.41 (3H, s), 1.67 (3H, s), 1.56 (3H, s), and 1.73 (6H, s), which were associated with the chrome/isoprene moieties.15,27 Two low-field doublets at d 7.59 (1H, \\(J\\) = 2.1 Hz) and 7.75 (1H, \\(J\\) = 2.1 Hz), assignable to the _meta_ aromatic hydrogens, indicated a 3,4,5-trisubstituted benzoic acid derivative, which was corroborated by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. A carboxyl group, with a signal at d 172.1, was placed between the two aromatic hydrogens (C-6). The chrome moiety was confirmed by the presence of signals at d 79.9, 129.5, and 121.9 assignable to the carbons C-2, C-3, and C-4, respectively.27 The DEPT 135deg spectrum confirmed these previous assignments and showed the presence of three methylenes at d 41.9 (C-1 ), 22.7 (C-2 ), and 28.2 (C-1 ), which were associated with the respective protons at d 1.78 (H-1 ), 2.25 (H-2 ), and 3.28 (H-1 ) by means of the HMQC spectrum. The linkage positions of the two isoprene side chains to the chrome/aromatic ring were determined by an HMBC experiment (Figure 1), in which correlations between the signals at d 128.9 (C-8) and 5.28 (H-2 ), between d 131.8 (C-7) and 3.28 (H-1 ), between d 41.9 (C-1 ) and 1.41 (H-9), and between d 123.9 (C-3) and 1.78 (H-1 ) were observed. Thus, the complete assignments of NMR data of **20** were made by analysis of HMQC and HMBC data and by comparison with those obtained for similar compounds isolated from _P. hothzkyanum_ and _P. aduncum_.11,28 Therefore, the structure of **20** was determined as 2-methyl-2-(4 -methyl-3 -pentenyl)-8-(3 -methyl-2 -butenyl)-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid, named gaudiachaudinic acid. The optical rotation, [a]25D +21 (_c_ 0.1, CHCl3), was similar to that observed for sargatridi,29 but this compound has two additional chiral carbons (C5 and C6 ) in its side chain and is not appropriate for a direct comparison. Nevertheless, the CD curve obtained for **20** was fully opposite to that described for sargatrid including the positive Cotton effect at 260-280 nm (styrene chromophore). Thus, despite the differences in the substitution pattern in the aromatic ring for **20**, the \\(S\\) configuration at C-2 was suggested.\n\nThe antifungal activities of compounds **1**-**23** isolated from these four _Piper_ species were evaluated against _C. caldosoprioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ (Table 1). The fungitoxic potential for the compounds **5**, **6**, **7**, **17**, **19**, and **21** has been previously reported.10,22,26,27 As can be seen, the chromene **9**, crassinervic acid (**1**), and hostmaniane (**18**) showed high potential as antifungal compounds and should be further evaluated against other fungi. Several compounds, **2**, **3**, **5**, **7**, **16**, and **19**, showed potency (1.0 _m_g) similar to that of the control. In the prenylated benzoic acid series (**1**-**3**) the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the side chain, as in the case of **1**, doubled the activity, while the changes in the double-bond configuration (**2** and **3**) did not cause significant improvement.\n\n### Experimental Section\n\n**General Experimental Procedures.** Optical rotations were measured on a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeter (Na filter, \\(l\\) = 588 nm) and CD spectrum in CHCl3 with a JASCO ORDUV-6 spectropolarimeter. IR spectra were measured in REPL pellets on a Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrometer model 1750. UV spectra were recorded on a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer using MeOH as solvent. LREIMS and HREIMS spectra were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/5988 A and a VG Autospee spectrometer, respectively, while LREIMS spectra were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. 'H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 500/300 and 125/75 MHz, respectively, on Bruker DRX-500 and Bruker DPX-300 spectrometers. CDCl3 (Aldrich) was used as solvent and TMS as internal standard. Chemical shifts were reported in \\(o\\) units (ppm) and coupling constants (_J_) in Hz. Elemental analyses were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer elemental analyzer model 2400 CNH. silica gel (Merck, 230-400 mesh) and Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma) were used for column chromatographic separations, while silica gel 60 PF254 (Merck) was used for analytical\n\nFigure 1.: Key HMBC correlations observed for compounds **1**, **8**, **18**, and **20**.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nTLC (0.25 mm), preparative TLC (1.0 mm), and circular chromatography (4.0 mm). HPLC separations were performed on a Varian model SD-1, using a reversed-phase column (C-18 Supelecosil, 10 \\(\\mu\\)m, 25 cm \\(\\times\\) 10 mm), with a flow rate of 2 mL/min and detection at 270 nm.\n\n**Plant Material.** Leaves from _P. crassinervium_ Knuth were collected on the campus of the Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.

The air-dried and powdered leaves from _P. aduncum_ (300 g) were extracted with EtOAc three times (3 x 1 L). The resulting extract (28.3 g) was dissolved in CHCl2 (100 mL) and partitioned with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (3 x 50 mL). The NaHCO3 solution was neutralized with HCl (6 M), extracted with EtOAc (3 x 50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated, yielding 764 mg of residue. This residue was applied to a silica gel column and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc, yielding five fractions (1-5). Fraction 3 (80 mg) was subjected to preparative TLC [CHCl2-MeOH (99:1), three editions], yielding **12** (15 mg).\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves from _P. hostmannianum_ (550 g) were extracted three times with a mixture of CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) (3 x 1 L) at room temperature.

Their structures were determined by spectroscopic/spectrometric data interpretation of 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR and MS experiments. The relative configuration was established by NOESY analysis, while the conformation adopted by these molecules was evaluated through molecular modeling studies and coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. Furthermore, the anxiolytic effects of the _E. mulungu_ aqueous alcoholic crude extract and of the purified alkaloids were evaluated using the elevated T-maze test.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Drosophila melanogaster (1-1)-11a-hydroxyerythrin\n\n## Page 2\n\ndemonstrate all coupling constants of H-11 with H\\({}_{\\rm{\\alpha}}\\),H\\({}_{\\rm{\\alpha}}\\)-10 (Table 1), which is completely compatible with an \\(\\alpha\\)-OH position at C-11. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR (Table 1) data also were comparable with those of the alkaloid **3**, which possesses C-11 with the same configuration. When we analyzed the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of **1** and **3**, the signal due to C-11 in both was observed at higher fields, \\(\\Delta\\delta\\approx 10\\) ppm, when comparable to the same carbon of (+)-11\\(\\beta\\)-hydroxyeystorine (also named (+)-erythrarine), which is a C-11 epimer.[3, 14] The total assignment of **1** was done by examination of the COSY, HMQC, NOESY, and HMBC (Figure 1) data of this compound. To confirm the relative configuration of C-3 and C-11 and to establish the conformation of **1**, the structure of (+)-\\(\\alpha\\)-hydroxyeystorine (**3**) was used as a model for a conformational analyses approach with the introduction of dihedral angle constraints obtained from the coupling constants between H11\\(-\\)H10 and H3\\(-\\)H4. On the basis of \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR data, the structure of compound **3** was build with an \\(\\alpha\\)-OH at C-11 (similar to compound **1**) and submitted to conformational analysis using the semiempirical methods AM1 and PM5 in the gas phase, with CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) and pyridine solvents, as previously described.[15, 16] The semiempirical methods were applied to compound 3 since it was previously identified as the 11a-epimer,[14] and our studies demonstrated that **3** has an 11a-hydroxyl, similar to that of the new derivative **1**. Four conformers were evaluated for this compound, obtained through inversion of ring B (two half-chairs) and of ring C (two envelopes). One of the half-chairs of ring B was not stable and changed to a twist-boat-like conformation (Figure 2C). This twist-boat, together with the conformational restraining induced by ring D, avoided the inversion of the envelope in ring C, allowing us to obtain only three minimum energy conformations for compound **3**, named **3a**, **3b**, and **3c** (Figure 2). The Haasnot\\(-\\)Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation[18] estimates the \\(\\mathcal{Y}_{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{ \\rm{ \\rm{ \\rm{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\\)\\) the \\({}^{13}\\)H coupling constants from the electronegativity of the substituents and from the H\\(-\\)C\\(-\\)C\\(-\\)H dihedral angle geometry. The obtained theoretical coupling constants for conformations **3a**, **3b**, and **3c** are presented in Table 1, and their energies are shown in Table 2. The comparison between theoretical and experimental coupling constants allowed characterization of the conformation of the erythrina alkaloids as represented by conformation **3c** in Table 1 and Figure 2. As already described by us,[16] this Hamiltonian presents better agreement with experimental data when compared to AM1.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n(\\(F\\)(12,132) = 2.42; \\(P<0.01\\)). Individual comparisons revealed that latencies to leave the enclosed arm were decreased with both **1** (10 mg/kg) and DZP treatments. Different from CE, one-way ANOVA did not reveal any effect of **1** or DZP on the latency to leave the open arms (\\(F\\)(3,33) = 0.71; \\(P\\) = 0.54).\n\nThe effects of **2** in the ETM measurements are shown in Figure 3 C. Two-way ANOVA showed significant effect of treatment (\\(F\\)(3,55) = 13.40, \\(P<0.0001\\)), trials (\\(F\\)(4,220) = 44.23; \\(P<0.0001\\)), and treatment versus trials interaction (\\(F\\)(12,220) = 6.33; \\(P<0.0001\\)) in the inhibitory avoidance measurements. Duncan's post hoc test revealed that animals treated with **2** (3 and 10 mg/kg) or DZP exhibited lower latencies to leave the enclosed arm of the ETM when compared with the control group (\\(P<0.05\\)). Neither **2** nor DZP significantly changed escape latencies (one-way ANOVA: \\(F\\)(3,55) = 0.61, \\(P<0.60\\)).\n\nFigure 3D shows the effects of **3** on the inhibitory avoidance and escape latencies in the ETM test. Two-way ANOVA showed effects of treatment (\\(F\\)(3,31) = 7.65; \\(P<0.0001\\)), trials (\\(F\\)(4,124) = 18.38; \\(P<0.0001\\)), and treatment versus trials interaction (\\(F\\)(12,-124) = 2.14; \\(P<0.001\\)) on inhibitory avoidance acquisition. Duncan's post hoc test revealed that the doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg of **3** significantly impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, an effect also shown with DZP (\\(P<0.05\\)). One-way ANOVA showed that neither **3** nor DZP produced significant effects on latency to leave the open arm (\\(F\\)(3,31) = 0.24; \\(P=0.86\\)).\n\nAdditionally, one-way ANOVA revealed no treatment effects of CE, **1**, **2**, **3**, or DZP on the number of rearing and crossings (locomotor activity) in the arena test (see Table 3).\n\nThe present study demonstrated that acute po treatment with CE attenuated anxiety-related responses in mice submitted to an animal model of anxiety, i.e., the ETM. These results corroborate a previous study,[12] in which the aqueous alcoholic extract of _E. mulungu_, at a dose of 200 mg/kg, produced anxiolytic-like effects in the inhibitory avoidance in the ETM in rats. These authors also reported an antianxiety effect with a lower dose of CE (100 mg/kg) in the light-dark transition model. In that study CE increased both the number of transitions between light and dark compartments and the time spent in the illuminated area, measures considered as anxiety indices.[12] Similar effects have been reported with chronic treatment with an equivalent range of doses (50\\(-\\)200 mg/kg) of CE on inhibitory avoidance in the ETM as well as on the number of transitions between compartments, and in the time spent in the illuminated compartment in the light-dark transition model.[13]\n\nThis study demonstrated that the erythrinian alkaloids isolated from _E. mulungu_ provoked anxiolytic-like effects in the ETM. The new erythrinian alkaloid **1** and the two known alkaloids **2** and **3** impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, and these effects were similar to that produced by DZP, a classical anxiolytic drug.\n\nThe underlying mechanisms involved in the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids were not in the scope of the present study and remain to be determined. However, it has been demonstrated that the dihydro-\\(\\beta\\)-erythroidine, an erythromycin alkaloid, antagonizes the excitatory effects of serotonin (5-HT) at the 5-HT3 receptor.[24] Thus, it is likely that the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids from _E. mulungu_ involve antagonism at 5-HT3 receptors, as shown for dihydro-\\(\\beta\\)-erythroidine.[24] Although attractive, this hypothesis remains to be empirically tested. It was demonstrated that the crude extract of _E. vespertilio_ inhibited platelet 5-HT release.[23] Platelets have been used as a useful model for studying Ca2+-dependent 5-HT release,[23] the main action of serotonin at 5-HT3 receptors.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the highest dose (400 mg/kg) of the crude extract decreased escape latency (i.e., the latency to leave the open arm) in the ETM. Similar effects obtained with other classes of drugs have been previously interpreted as anxiolytic, instead of anxiogenic.[19] It has been suggested that drugs that diminish risk-assessment behavior, such as buspirone and the serotonin releaser fenfluramine, also decrease escape latencies in the ETM.[19] Curiously, the pure alkaloids did not alter escape latencies. It is likely that synergistic interactions with other compounds of the crude extract are important to provoke the anxiolytic effects observed in the escape task.\n\nTaken together, these results suggests that the new erythrinian alkaloid (+)-11a-hydroxy-erythravine (**1**) and the known (+)-erythravine (**2**) and (+)-a-hydroxyerysorting (**3**) are, in part, responsible for the anxiolytic effects observed with the crude extract of _E. mulungu_.\n\n## Experimental Section\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nOptical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz cuvette (length 1 cm).

Molecular modeling calculations were performed using the BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2 (BioMedCAChe, 2001).\n\n**Plant Material.** Influences of _E. mulungu_ were collected in September 2002, at Rifania, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen is deposited in the herbarium of the Departament of Vegetal Biotechnology, at the University of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, under the reference number HPM-0032.\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** Fresh inflorescences (3 kg) were macerated with EtOH/H3/O (70:30) at 30\\(-\\)50 U cover a period of 10 days. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a humid crude extract (CE) (120 g) that was oxidized with a 10% HOAc solution. This solution was extracted with CHCl3 and was then made alkaline (pH 9\\(-\\)10) with NHOH and re-extracted with CHCl3 to afford a mixture of crude alkaloids (670 mg).\n\nThe alkaloidal fraction was separated by flash chromatography on Si gel, exiting with CHCl3/CHOH (100:0 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 70:30), to yield 60 fractions of 20 mL each, grouped into five (1\\(-\\)2 mA; 3\\(-\\)5 m = 8; 6\\(-\\)20 m = C; 21\\(-\\)30 = D; 31\\(-\\)60 = E).

Each of the obtained conformations was further submitted to full geometry optimization using AM1 and PMS semiempirical methods in both gas and solvent phases. For representation of CDCl3 and pyridine solvents the COSMO solvation model was used. The relative permittivity value for CDCl3 was adjusted to \\(\\epsilon\\) = 4.9 and for pyridine to \\(\\epsilon\\) = 12.5, while the effective VVD radius of the solvent molecules was adjusted to 2.81 A for CDCl3 and to 2.9 A for pyridine. Hessian matrix analyses were employed to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. All calculations were performed using BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2\\({}^{25}\\) in order to obtain theoretical \\({}^{1}\\)J\\({}_{\\rm H,H}\\) coupling constants for the minimum energy conformations produced in conformational analysis, we applied the Haasnot\\(-\\)Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation\\({}^{18}\\) to the endocytic angle geometries.\n\n**Behavioral Studies. Animals.** Male Swiss mice (Sao Paulo State University/UNESP, SP, Brazil), weighing 25\\(-\\)35 g, were housed in groups of 10 per cage (41 cm x 34 cm x 16 cm) and maintained under a normal 12 h light cycle (lights on 070-00 h) in a temperature/humidity controlled environment (23 +- 1 V/55 +- 5%). Food and water were freely available. All mice were experimentally naive. Experimental procedures were in compliance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Local Ethical Committee (no. 35/2004).\n\n**Compound Administration.** CE and alkaloids were suspended in saline (NaCl 0.9%) and diazepam (DZP) in saline at \\(\\sim\\) 2% Tween 80. Animals were orally treated with CE (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) and with a range of doses (3\\(-\\)10 mg/kg) of each isolated alkaloid, or vehicle (saline), and intraperitoneally with DZP (2 mg/kg). All compounds were administered 30 min before the experimental session.\n\n**Apparatus. Elevated T-Maze (ETM).** The ETM was positioned 38.5 cm above the floor with three arms of equal dimensions (30 cm \\(\\times\\) 5 cm). One arm was enclosed by transparent glass walls (15 cm) and stored perpendicular to two open arms. To avoid falls, the open arms were surrounded by a Plexiglas rim 0.25 cm high.\n\n**Locomotor Activity Test (LAT).** To assess locomotor activity, animals were exposed to a plastic rectangular box (40 cm x 48 cm x 30 cm) with its floor divided into 30 squares (8 cm\\({}^{4}\\)).\n\nA standard procedure was used for both tests.\\({}^{19}\\)\n\n**Statistics.** All results were initially submitted to Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Where this test yielded significance, results were log transformed and again submitted to Levene's test, before being submitted to ANOVA. The inhibitory avoidance measures obtained in the ETM were submitted to two-way ANOVA with treatment as the independent factor and trial as the dependent factor. Where significant main effects or interactions were obtained, data were further analyzed by Duncan's post hoc test. The escape latency in the ETM and LAT results were submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed by Duncan's post hoc test when significant. In all cases a \\(P\\) value \\(<\\) 0.05 was considered significant.\n\n**Acknowledgment.** This work was funded by grants of the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) as part of the Biota-FAPESP\\(-\\)The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.wi.biotas.org/.br), grant no. 03/2176-7 awarded to V.S.B.

Le Roch, Mario A. Izidoro, Paulo C. Vieira\n\n# Abstract\n\n_Metrodorea stipularis_ stem extracts were studied in the search for possible antichagastic, antimalarial, and antitumoral compounds using cruzain from _Tympanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium falciparum_, and cathepsin B and L, as molecular targets, respectively. Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed significant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Compounds 1-4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 \\(\\mu\\)M against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three different strains of _P. falciparum_ in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsin B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 \\(\\mu\\)M. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe study of the role of the various species of dihydrochalcones is a key step in the development of the biological process of cancer.

Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6-trihydroyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2,en-1-yl)phenyl)propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2\n\nCompounds **2** and **3** were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESTTOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for **2** and **3**, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C23H30O3 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for **2** and **3** showed one singlet at \\(d\\) 5.92 attributed to H-8', the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both **2** and **3** the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.76 (H-3') and 2.53 (H-4') and the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.33 (H-9' and H-10'). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at \\(d\\) 6.91 (H-5' and H-7') and 6.56 (H-8') for **2** and signals at \\(d\\) 6.87 (H-2'), 6.83 (H-6'), and 6.64 (H-5') for **3** assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound **2** showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.73 (H-3') and 2.69 (H-4') and the signals of the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.22 (H-8' and H-9'). Compound **3** displayed one premyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4'' and H-5''), one olefinic hydrogen at \\(d\\) 5.28 (H-2''), and the methylene signal at \\(d\\) 3.25 (H-1''). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in **1** and confirmed the structures of **2** and **3**.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESTTOFMS data showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (calculated _m_/_z_ 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O3. As mentioned for compounds **2** and **3**, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the characteristic signals of the three methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at \\(d\\) 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and confirmed the structure of **4**.\n\nThe dihydrochalcones **1**-**4** showed inhibition activities against crazin, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 _m_M (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the first report of crazin inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies.\n\nDihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 _m_M (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochalcones **1** and **3** showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these compounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more effective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydrochalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsin s such as cathepsin K.12\n\nThe dihydrochalcones were also tested against _Plasmodium falciparum_ growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against _P. falciparum_ the dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** showed significant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 _m_M for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against _P. falciparum_ growth for this class of compounds.\n\nFour compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases crazin and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of _Plasmodium falciparum_. The results described in this paper are significant, since this is the first report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against crazin, and it is interesting that compounds **2** and **4** are active against cathepsin B, while compounds **1** and **3** are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of finding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nAll commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co, and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-_4\\(6\\) and methanol-_4\\(p\\) using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe AITA). MS data were collected on a Bruker Dalonics micrOTOF-Q. II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H5SO/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230-700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna).\n\n### Plant Materials.\n\nThe stems of _Metrodarea stipularis_ were collected in July 2010 at the Agornomic Institute in Campinas, SP1; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 degC, affording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against crucain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed significant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 5.0 cm x h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10.0, 15.5, 5.5, 0.10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1-MSD24).\n\nFraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15.1-MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg).\n\nFraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 3.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD211_1-MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD211_8-MSD21\\(8\\)20). Subfraction MSD21_8 12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21\\(8\\)19 (9 mg) was purified by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, _ph_ = 1.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/cAMP/H2O (4:15) as mobile phase and a flow of 3.5 mL/min to afford 4 (2.5 mg).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)/propan-1-one (2):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2066 (caled for C3H2H2O3 _m_/_z_ 410.2094).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(14-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4-trimethyl-2,3,44,96-hydroxy-10-Mantham-7-ylpropan-1-one (4):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 2; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (caled for C9H2O3 _m_/_z_ 478.2720).\n\n**Enzyme Inhibition Assays.**_Gruzin._ All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectrofluorimeter.

The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) with 5 mL of DTT at 37 degC after addition of 2 mL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with five inhibitor concentrations.

The hexane-soluble phase was concentrated and submitted to chromatographic procedures to afford the new compound **1.** Stearic acid 4-pentoyloxyphenyl ester (**1**) was obtained as an amorphous powder and its molecular formula, C32H503 was established from ES-MS, \\({}^{\\text{}}\\)H- and \\({}^{\\text{}}\\)3C-NMR data. The ES-MS exhibited a molecular ion peak at m/z 475 [M + H]+ and representative ion peaks at m/z 207, 191, 177 and 163, which are consistent with the 4-(_n_-pentoxy)-phenethyl moiety proposed for **1**. An IR band at 1710 cm-1 and one signal at d 173.9 in the \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR spectrum suggested an aliphatic ester. The \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectrum (Table **1**) showed two _ortho_-coupled doublets due to a 4-O-substituted phenethyl unit and three triplets for six hydrogens at d 4.23, d 3.64 and d 2.85 due to the oxygen-bearing methylenes (H-8' and H-1') and to the benzyline methylene (H-7), respective-by. Moreover, signals at d 2.27, d 1.58, d 1.55 and d 1.25 corresponding to several methylenes, and two triplets at d 0.86 and d 0.88, attributed to two terminal methyl groups suggested, as part of **1**, two aliphatic methylene chains. The \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR spectrum (Table **1**) showed signals which confirmed the phenethyl moiety and two aliphatic methylene chains in compound **1**. The HOMO-COSY experiment evidenced the spins system associated with aromatic _ortho_-coupled hydrogens and with methylene hydrogens H-8' and H-7'. Additional couplings between methylene hydrogens at d 3.64 and d 1.55 as well as at d 2.27, d 1.58 and d 1.25 were also evidenced by the COSY spectrum and gave clear indication of signals belonging to each methylene chain. Precise assignments of all hydrogens and carbons followed from detailed analysis of gHMQC and gHMBC spectra (Table **1**) and allowed the location of the two aliphatic moieties in compound **1**. Correlations between H-1' and C-4' as well as between H-7' and C-1' were evidenced in the gHMBC spectrum and corroborated the 4-(_n_-pentoxy)-phenethyl moiety of compound **1**. Additionally, correlation of H-8' with C-1' and C-1 evidenced the stearic acid bonding to the phenethyl moiety through an ester linkage. Subsequent attempts to confirm the structure of compound **1** through ES-MS analysis disclosed the base peak with m/z 267 and minor peaks in good agreement with the expected fragmentation pattern for compound **1**. Additional evidence was obtained from mild basic hydrolysis of **1** followed by methylation, achieved in good yield, to produce the expected stearic methyl ester, which was identified from GC-MS analysis. Thus, **1** was established as stearic acid 4-[(_n_-pentoxy)-phenethyl] ester.\n\nThis compound was tested against Gram-positive bacteria _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Bacillus cereus_, _B. anthracis_ and _B. subtilis_; Gram-negative bacteria _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Pseudonocardia termophyta_ and fast-acid bacterium _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ due to the inhibition displayed by the crude ethanol extract against these strains. However, the new isolate **1** only showed significant activity against Gram-positive bacteria _Bacillus cereus_ and _B. subtilis_ and fast-acid bacterium _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ (Table **2**) and gave no inhibition against the other strains at the concentration of 10 mg/mL, which were compared with the positive control claritomycin at the concentration of 1.28 mg/mL [7].\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\nSilica gel 60 F254 sheets (Merck and Sigma) were used for TLC and open Column Chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (60-230 \\(\\mu\\)m, Merck). Solvents: EtOH, hexane, MeOH, EtOAc, _n_-BuOH and DMSO (Merck and Sigma-Aldrich) were used for chromatographic procedures, bioassays and UV/IR analysis; CDCl3 (Merck) was used for NMR purposes. IR and UV spectra were recorded on a FT-1750 Perkin Elmer and UV/Vis Hitachi U-3000 spectrometers. ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG platform II spectrometer; \\({}^{1}\\)H- and \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian-Inova Unit 500 spectrometer using TMS as internal standard.\n\n### Stemodia foliosa\n\nBenth was collected in July, 1998 at the Campus of Federal University of Pernambuco (UFFE), in Recife, Northeastern Brazil. The botanical material was identified by Dr. Alda Chiappeta, from Departamento de Antibioticos-UFFE, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de Botanica-UFFE, under the number UFFE-19810. Whole aerial parts of this shrub (1.0 kg) were dried at room temperature, powdered, extracted with ethanol and concentrated to give a crude extract (52.0 g). Aliquots from the ethanol extract were separated for acute toxicity and antibacterial bioassays.\n\nThe antibiotic assay was performed with Gram-positive bacteria: _Staphylococcus aureus_ (DAUFPE 01), _Bacillus cereus_ (DAUFPE 11), _B. anthracis_ (DAUFPE 09) and _B. subtilis_ (DAUFPE 016); Gram-negative bacteria: _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ (DAUFPE 396*) and _Pseudonocardia thermophyta_ (DAUFPE 3517) and fast-acid bacterium _Mycobacterium fortuitum_ (DAUFPE 405). Bacteria were incubated on a nutrient agar-slant (stationary culture) for 48 h \n\n## Page 3\n\nat 37 degC followed by inoculation in Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) medium. Bacteria strains were supplied by Departamento de Antibioticos-UFPE. The antibacterial activity was demonstrated using the disc-diffusion method originally described by Watt and Collee [6]. The stock solution of each test compound/extract in DMSO was diluted at 10 mg/mL in nutrient broth. All the tests were done by placing the disc (9 mm diameter) impregnated with extracts, fractions or pure compound **1** on the MHA surface previously inoculated with 10 mL of (MHA) liquid medium with Gram-positive, Gram-negative and fast acid bacteria. DMSO was used as negative control and standard antibiotic claritomycin (1.28 mg/disc) was used as reference or positive control. Plates were incubated at 37 degC for 48 h and the inhibition zones around each disc were measured.\n\nThe ethanol extract (52.0 g) was partitioned between H2O and _n_-BuOH to give the aqueous and _n_-BuOH phases. After evaporation of the solvents, the _n_-BuOH residue (41.0 g) was dissolved in 80% aqueous MeOH and sequentially partitioned with _n_-hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The _n_-hexane soluble phase was concentrated to give a bioactive _n_-hexane extract (9.4 g), which was subjected to silica gel (300.0 g) column chromatography, eluted with _n_-hexane/EtOAc gradient: 9:1, 8:2 and 75:25, (1000 mL of each eluent). Fractions were tested and those obtained upon elution with _n_-hexane/EtOAc (8:2) proved to contain bioactive compounds. They were analyzed by TLC (_n_-hexane/EtOAc 8:2, UV detection at 254 nm), pooled (2.1g) and further submitted to silica gel (200 g) column chromatography using a _n_-hexane/EtOAc gradient: 95:5, 9:1, 8:2 and 7:3, (300 mL of each eluent). Fractions eluted with _n_-hexane/EtOAc 95:5 were pooled and further purified by preparative TLC (_n_-hexane/EtOAc 9:1), yielding the new bioactive compound **1** (35.0 mg, Rf 0.26), in addition to a mixture of sitosterol and stigmasterol (100 mg), lupeol (90 mg) and lupeol acetate (12 mg), which have been identified from analyzes of their NMR spectra and comparison with literature data [8], [9]. Copies of the original spectra are obtainable from the author of correspondence.\n\n## References\n\n- Barroso G.

SILVA\\(\\dagger\\)*\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n_Styrax camporum_ Pohl (Styracaceae), known in Brazil as \"estoraque do campo\" or \"cuia de brejo\", grows in the States of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais and is popularly used in gastrointestinal diseases [1]. Its reported uses have led to a study of the composition and antiulcer activity of the crude extract of the bark and the trunk [2]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the bark of _S. camporum_ has resulted in the isolation of homoegonol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, sitosterol, vanillin and esters of cinnamic and ferulic acids [3]. The present article deals with the isolation from stems of _S. camporum_, and the identification and cytotoxicity evaluation of two benzofuran lignans, egonol (**1**) and homoegonol (**2**), and one furofuran lignan, (\\(\\pm\\))springaresinol (**3**),\n\n## Page 4\n\noriginally isolated from _Styrax obassia_[4, 5] and _Forsythia intermedia_[6], respectively. Lignans are known to possess several biological activities [7-11], including antitumor, e.g., some podophyllotoxin derivatives, currently in clinical use, and cytotoxic, e.g., the benzofuran lignan licarin A which is active against KB cells. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compounds **1-3** against C6, Hep-2 and HeLa human carcinoma cells, the MTT spectrophotometric assay was used.\n\n## 2 Experimental\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe stems of _S. camporum_ Pohl were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guacu, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen (Young 07 - SP) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. 1H, 13C-NMR, DEPT and COSY spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-D6 using TMS as internal standard on a Bruker AC 200 or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS, on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. CC was performed over silica gel 60, 70-230 or 230-400 mesh or Sephadex LH-20 (Merck). TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and/or by spraying with 2% anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe dried and powdered stems of _S. camporum_ (470.0 g) were extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue (57.2 g) was taken up in aqueous MeOH (MeOH-H2O 80 : 20; 200 mL) and subsequently extracted with hexane. Sufficient water was added to the aqueous methanol fraction to make it up to 60% aqueous MeOH, which was extracted with CHCl3 followed by EtOAc. The CHCl3 fraction (3.8 g) was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane-EtOAc 1 : 1 v/v (A), CHCl3 (B), EtOAc (C), CHCl3-CH3OH 1 : 1 v/v (D), MeOH (E) and H2O (F) (300 mL each). After evaporation, fraction A (370 mg) was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (98 : 2) and 62 fractions (15 mL each) were collected. Combined fraction 6-15 afforded **1** (34.3 mg, CHCl3-MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.26) and the combined fraction 17-18 afforded **2** (11.7 mg, CHCl3-MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.50). Fraction C (630 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 19 fractions (10 mL each) were collected. Combined fractions 2-7 (363 mg) were rechromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 52 fractions (3 mL each) were collected. Purification of the combined fractions 31-41 (98 mg) by prep. TLC (eluent CHCl3-MeOH 92 : 8) yielded **3** (5.1 mg, CHCl3-MeOH\n\n## Page 5\n\n85 : 15, Rf 0.61). All known compounds were identified with the help of UV, IR, MS and NMR, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nCellular viability in the presence and absence of test compounds was determined using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, Dorset, U.K.) microculture assay [12]. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase reduces MTT to a blue formazan product with an absorbance at 560 nm in DMSO. Cells harvested in the log phase of the growth were counted and seeded (5 x 104 cells/well in 1 mL) in 48-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37degC under 4.3% CO2 to allow cell attachment, cultures of the Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were treated with several test compound concentrations. Three replicate wells were set up for each experimental condition. After another 24 h incubation period, MTT (100 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution) was added, the plate was incubated for 3 h and unreduced MTT was removed. Acid isopropanol (HCl 0.3%; 100 mL) was added to dissolve the blue formazan. The absorbance at 560 nm was read by using a Pharmacia LKB-Ultrospec III spectrophotometer. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of test compound \n\n## Page 6\n\nresulting in a 50% reduction of absorbance compared to untreated cells in the MTT assay. Absorbances taken from cells grown in the absence of drugs were taken as 100% cell survival (control). For each compound the percent viability was plotted against concentration and the IC50 (concentration required to reduce viability by 50%) values were calculated for the three cell lines. This experiment was also performed with a positive control anticancer agent: streptonigrin.\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\nThe isolated lignans: egonol, homoegonol and (+-) syringaresinol were evaluated for their cytotoxicities by the MTT method in the three cell lines: Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma). Each compound was tested at five different concentrations. The concentration-response curves thus generated were used to calculate the IC50 (table 1).\n\nThe cytotoxic activity was expressed in terms of relative absorbance of drug-treated cells, in comparison to control cells. The results show a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect relationship for all the lignans and all the cell lines evaluated. Significant activities (IC50 < 10 mg/mL) could be observed for egonol against C6 and Hep-2 cell lines and for homoegonol against C6 and HeLa cells, when compared to the positive control streptonigrin activity (table 1). The activity of egonol against HeLa cells, homoegonol against Hep-2 cells as well as the activity of syringaresinol, the only furofuran neolignan under investigation in this study towards the three cell lines were moderate. It is interesting to note the significant differences of activity related to the lignan structure.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo) and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - Brazil) for financial support of this work, and fellowships to H.L.T., J.P.H., P.M.P. and J.R.C.P.\n\n## References\n\n* Manual de identificacao e cultivo de plantas arboreas nativas do Brasil_, Vol. 1, p. 332, Instituto Plantarum de Estudos da Flora, Sao Paulo (1982).\n* [2] E.M.

NF\\(\\kappa\\)B regulates the expression of several genes involved in carcinogenesis. These include anti-apoptotic, cytokines and cell cycle-regulatory genes. It is well established that the transcriptional factor NF\\(\\kappa\\)B is deregulated in many forms of cancer. Thus, agents that can suppress NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation have the potential of suppressing carcinogenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from _Alchornea glandulosa_ (Euphorbiaceae) and eight esters were synthesised. These compounds were evaluated against TNF-\\(\\alpha\\)-induced NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation with stably transfected 293/NF\\(\\kappa\\)B-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Gallates with IC\\({}_{50}\\) values in a range of 10-56 uM mediated inhibitory activity higher than gallic acid (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 76.0 \\(\\pm\\) 4.9 uM). In addition to inhibiting NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation, gallic acid mediated a modest cytotoxic effect, and some of the gallates affected cell viability at the tested concentrations. Based on these results, suppression of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis.\n\ngallic acid; NF\\(\\kappa\\)B pathway; cytotoxicity; 293/NF\\(\\kappa\\)B cells; _Alchornea glandulosa_; cancer chemoprevention 148010\n\n## Page 4\n\nGallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid), a secondary metabolite accumulates in nearly all plants, either in free form or part of tannins, is known to possess antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic properties (Aruoma, Murcia, Butler, & Halliwell, 1993; Fiuza et al., 2004; Kratz et al., 2008; Kroes, van den Berg, van Ulford, van Dijk, & Labadie, 1992; Kubo, Fujita, K. Nihei & A. Nihei, 2004). It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as salts and esters. Some ointments used to treat psoriasis and external hemorrhoids contain gallic acid (Garcia de Hombre & Perez Penate, 2006; Hatton, 2000). Gallic acid has two major functional groups, hydroxyls and a carboxylic acid, which can yield numerous esters and salt derivatives. Some galloyl compounds are used as antioxidants in food and can exhibit important roles in prevention of inflammatory and atherosclerosis responses by blocking activation of NF_k_B (Murase et al., 1999).\n\nNF_k_B consists of homo and heterodimeric protein complexes acting as a transcription factor, and is found in many animal cell types. It is involved in regulation of immune response and inflammation, cell lineage development, cell apoptosis, cell-cycle progression and oncogenesis due to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidised LDL and microbial antigens, and has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, cIAP, survivin, TRAF, COX-2, MMP-9, iNOS and cell cycle-regulatory components, whose products are involved in tumourigenesis (Aggarwal, Sethi, Nair, & Ichikawa, 2006; Chen, Castranova, & Shi, 2001; Melisi & Chiao, 2007; Thanos & Maniatis, 1995). Most carcinogens, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, or tumour promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, H2O2, have been shown to activate NF_k_B, and resulting tumours have misregulated NF_k_B activity (Baldwin, 2001). It is now well established that aberrant regulation of NF_k_B, and the signalling pathways that control its activity, are involved in cancer development and progression, as well as in drug resistance, especially during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Inoue, Gohda, Akiyama, & Semba, 2007). Blocking NF_k_B can cause tumour cells to stop proliferating, undergo apoptosis, or to become more sensitive to the action of antitumor agents (Frydrych & Mlejnek, 2008; Yamamoto & Gaynor, 2001). Thus, agents that can suppress NF_k_B activation have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis or tumourigenesis.\n\nIn the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from _Alchornea glandulosa_ Poepp and Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), and eight semi-synthetic esters were prepared. All the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity as well as potential to inhibit TNF-_a_-induced NF_k_B activation with stably transfected 293/NF_k_B-Luc human embryonic kidney cells.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Materials\n\nMethanol, _n_-hexane, ethyl acetate and _p_-dioxane were of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade (JT Baker). Column chromatography was carried out over silica gel (0.06-0.20 mm, Acros Organics). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). Preparative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system and a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional NMR experiments were \n\n## Page 5\n\nrecorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (\\({}^{1}\\)H) and 125 MHz (\\({}^{13}\\)C), using CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) and DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) as solvent (Aldrich). Alkyl alcohols and DCC were purchased from Aldrich. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and sulphorhodamine B (SRB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), antibiotic-antimycotic, hygromycin B, and MEM sodium pyruvate were purchased from Invitrogen Co. (Carlsbad, CA). Reporter Lysis Buffer, Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison). Tumour Necrosis Factor-\\(\\alpha\\) (TNF-\\(\\alpha\\)) was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Alcohol was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ).\n\n### Isolation of gallic acid\n\nThe leaves of _A. glandulosa_ were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guaqu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen (SP319257) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil).\n\nThe shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with _n_-hexane (3.5 L x 3) at room temperature and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L x 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrup residue, which was diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and then successively partitioned with EtOAc and _n_-BuOH. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the partition phases yielded 2.5 g and 0.8 g, respectively. The part of EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford 11 fractions (A1-A11). Fraction A2 (730 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : HOAc (7.5 : 92 : 0.5), UV detection at 265 nm; flow rate 15 mL min-1] to give compound **1** (335 mg). Compound **1** was identified as gallic acid based on analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data, as well as by comparison with authentic material in our laboratory (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Molecular structures of gallic acid (**1**) and semi-synthetic esters (**2–9**).\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\n\n\n### Synthesis of esters 2-9\n\nAfter being cooled at 5\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, the mixture of gallic acid (0.2 mmol) and alcohol (20 mmol) in _p_-dioxane (6.0 mL) was added to a solution of \\(N\\),_N_'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in _p_-dioxane (3.0 mL). The solution was stirred for 48 h, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned three times with EtOAc and then filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (three times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (three times), water (two times), dried over MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column using an isocratic system of CHCl3-MeOH (98 : 2) to give gallate esters **2-8**. Structures of the semi-synthetic esters, methyl gallate (**2**), ethyl gallate (**3**), _n_-propyl gallate (**4**), isopropyl gallate (**5**), _n_-butyl gallate (**6**), isobutyl gallate (**7**), _n_-pentyl gallate (**8**) and 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid (**9**), were established by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis (Figure 1).\n\nFor synthesis of ester **9**, gallic acid (20 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (5.0 mL) and anhydride acetic (5.0 mL) under hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, carried to dryness under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography with a mixture of CHCl3-MeOH (85 : 15) to give a product (**9**). The NMR spectroscopic data of **9** were compatible with 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid.\n\n### NF_k_B luciferase assay\n\nNF_k_B inhibition assay was conducted using a luciferase reporter gene bioassay as previously described (Homhual et al., 2006). Human embryonic kidney cells (293/NF_k_B-Luc) were used to monitor alteration of the NF_k_B pathway. This cell line is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct regulated by the NF_k_B response element. Transcription factor can bind to the response element when stimulated by TNF-a, allowing transcription of the luciferase gene. Luciferase reacts with substrate, emitting light that was detected using a luminometer. Cells were seeded (105 cells mL-1) on sterile white walled 96-well plates and grown to approximately 80% confluence by incubating for 48 h. Gallic acid and alkyl gallates were tested at 20 mg mL-1 following 1 : 3 serial dilutions. After treatment with tested compounds for 10 min, cells were incubated for an additional 6 h with or without TNF-a (5 ng mL-1). The cells were gently washed with PBS and kept at -80degC with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corporation). The luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay system from Promega following manufacturer instructions. Luciferase activity was monitored (LUMIstar Galaxy BMG), dose-response curves were constructed, and results were expressed as IC50 values (i.e. concentration required to inhibit TNF-a induced NF_k_B activity by 50%).\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nCytotoxicity was determined by the method of Skehan et al. (1990). The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and stained for 30 min with 0.4% (w/v) sulphorhodamine B (SRB) prepared in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM Tris base\n\n## Page 7\n\n[tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism(r) Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences between means were located using Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences between means at the 5% (\\(p<0.05\\)) level were considered significant. The data are expressed as \\(\\text{means}\\pm\\text{standard}\\) error.\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\nHerein we report cytotoxic properties and suppression of TNF-a induced NFkB activation of gallic acid (**1**) and eight esters (**2-9**) determined with stably transfected 293/NFkB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Table 1 shows the concentrations of gallates **1-9** required to inhibit NFkB-induced activation in 50% (IC50). _N_-Tosyl-L-phenylalaninyl-chlormethylketone (TPCK) was adopted as positive control, exhibiting \\(98.5\\%\\pm 0.5\\%\\) NFkB inhibition at 30 uM, with an IC50 value of about 5 uM. At the highest concentration tested (20.0 ug mL-1), gallic acid mediated a moderate cytotoxic effect (52.9% \\(\\pm\\) 3.5% survival), but none of the gallate esters significantly affected cell viability. The most cytotoxic compound evaluated was **6**, with \\(48.9\\%\\pm 3.3\\%\\) cell survival.\n\nAmong inhibitors of NFkB, salicylates, aspirin (Kopp & Ghosh, 1994), apigenin and curcumin (Gerritsen et al., 1995; Singh & Aggarwal, 1996) were reported to suppress activation of NFkB by preventing the degradation of the NFkB inhibitor (IkB), and therefore NFkB was retained in the cytosol.\n\nThe serine protease inhibitor TPCK can cause a complete block to NFkB activation. TPCK inhibits NFkB subunits processing and IkB degradation (Mellitis, Hay, & Goodbourn, 1993). It has also been demonstrated that TPCK inhibits DNA replication by G0-G1 growth arrest and thus promotes apoptosis by other cytotoxic stimuli (Kirillova, Chaisson, & Fausto, 1999).\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\nThe present study provides evidence that some gallates can act as inhibitors of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B. Methyl gallate (**2**) demonstrated the greatest activity. The inhibitory actions of gallates do not appear to result from non-specific cellular toxicity but rather are specific for NF\\(\\kappa\\)B-dependent gene transcription. In another study, it has been demonstrated that gallates can inhibit TNF-\\(\\alpha\\)-induced nuclear translocation of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B by way of a mechanism independent of I\\(\\kappa\\)B degradation (Murase et al., 1999).\n\nMore recently, prevention of atherosclerosis, cancer, anti-plasmodial and antioxidant activity of a group of galloyl compounds was described, as well as structure-activity relationships yielding cytotoxic properties (Fiuza et al., 2004; Jagan, Ramakrishnan, Anandakumar, Kamaraj, & Devaki, 2008; Locatelli et al., 2008; Murase et al., 1999; Na et al., 2006; Petronio et al., 2007; Saxena et al., 2008). Based on these encouraging intracellular responses, we suggest suppression of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis, and further investigations related to the actions of gallates, especially in NF\\(\\kappa\\)B signaling pathway and _in vivo_ models, may provide new insights into the cancer chemopreventive ability.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis study is supported by a programme project P01 CA48112 awarded by the National Cancer Institute and project 04/07932-7 of the Biota-Bioprospecta Program funded by Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil.

(RUBIACEAE). The present communication reports the isolation and identification of four triterpenoid saponins from the chloroform extract of the leaves of _Tocoyena brasiliensis_: 3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside, 3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside, 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside, 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside ester derivative of quinovic acid as binary mixtures, respectively. From the ethanol extract a flavonoid identified as ramazin-3_-O_-rutinoside was obtained. The structures of these compounds were assigned by data analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectrometry and comparison with data recorded in the literature for these compounds.\n\n_Tocoyena brasiliensis_: saponins; antifungal.\n\n**INTRODUCAO**\n\nO genero _Tocoyena_ (Rubiaceae), com cerca de 30 especies, ocorre nas regioes pan e neotropical1. Sao especies tipicas do Cerrado, sendo encontradas prefereicallmente no Cerrado _stricto senti_-_so_, mas tambem ocerran em florestas com clima quente e imido, como a Fluerasa Amazonica2. Todos os representantes de _Tocoyena_ sao arvores de pequeno porte ou arbustos. Este genero pertenec a subfamlia Ixoroidaee, tribo Gardenieae-Gardenineae, sendo os iridoides considerados se principal marcador quimiotaxonomico3. Investigacoes fittoquimicas previamente realizadas por nosso grupo sobre Rubiaceae, em particular _T. formosa_, conduziu ao isolamento de iridades glicosilados e nao glicosilados, una saponina triterpeneia derivada do cido quinvoice o un flavaned picosilado4.5. Alem de iridoides, a subfamlia e conhecida por metabolizar flavonoides, triterpenos, derivados fenolicos e alcaloides do tipo emetincios, quinolinocios e poliindoleninicos1.\n\n_Tocoyena brasiliensis_ Mart., conhecida popularmente como genipahipo, nao apresenta registro de trabalhos sobre sua compostaciona. Ensaios preliminares, objetivando a deteccao de substancias com atividade antifringa, indicaram para o extrato clorformico das folhas desta especie attividade fraca contra o funso filamentos _Cladosporioides_. O presente trabalho descreve o isolamento e identificacao de duals misturas binarias de saponinas triterpenicas e um flavonoide glicosilado. As misturas das saponinas **14**2 **c 34** **a**presentaram atividade moderada contra o fungo _C. cladosporioides_. As estruturas das substancias foram establecidas com base na analise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D.\n\n**RESULTADOSE E DISCUSSAO**\n\nO estudo fittoquimico das folhas de _T. brasiliensis_ resultou na separacao de dus misturas binarias de saponinas triterpenicas, a primeira contendo a cido 3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside-quinovoco7 (I) e o acido-3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside-cinoblico (2) e a segunda, o acido 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside-quinovoc8 (3) e o acido 28_-O_-b-D-glucopyranosideoquinov6 (4). A saponina identificada como o acido 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside-do-quinovoc8 (3) e o flavonoidde ramanzina-3_-O_-rutinoside0 (5) tambem foram isolados como substancias puras neste estudo.\n\nAs estruturas dos compostos isolados foram caracterizadas a partir da analise dos dados espectroscopicos (RMN de 1H e 13C, DEPT 135, COSY 'H-H, _g_HMQC, _g_HMQC, _g_HMQC, _t_OCSY 1D) e por comparacao com os dados disposinvels na literatura.\n\nAs quatora saponimas triterpenicas isoladas apresentaram como padro comun os C-27 e C-28 oxidados como grupo carboxilico. A coorfencia do grupo carboxiloa no C-27 foi evidenciada principalmente pela diferenca \\(\\Delta\\delta\\) no C-14 de aproximadamente + 13,0 ppm, quando comparado com a \\(\\alpha\\)-amirina (C-14 \\(\\approx\\) 8 42,0)11. A diferenca de deslocamento quimico deste carbono e decorrente do efeito \\(\\alpha\\) da carboxilia (C-27) em C-14. Assim, os esquelettes triterpenicas das saponinas isoladas foram identificados como derivados do cido quinovoc12 ou do cido cincholico12, bastante discutivoides e analisados na literatura.\n\nA ocorrencia da mistura binaria das saponinas **1+2** foi evidenciada no espectro de RMN de 1H pelos sinais em 8 5,49 (m) e\n\n## Page 2\n\n5,45 (m) atribuidos aos atomos de hidrogenio definicios (H-12). O espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C mostrou sinais para dois esqueletos triterpenicos, sendo estes sinais analogos aos observados para acido quinovi\\({}^{12}\\) e acido cincholico\\({}^{12}\\). No espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C foram observados os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 128,1 (C-12), 132,8 (C-13), 55,5 (C-14), 53,8 (C-18), 38,6 (C-19), 36,2 (C-20), 176,9 (C-27), 178,8 (C-28), 18,2 (C-29) e 21,2 (C-30), que caracterizaram o esquelet triterpenico de acido quinovi\\({}^{13}\\). Para a cido cicholico formar observados no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 125,1 (C-12), 136,8 (C-13), 55,4 (C-14), 43,2 (C-18), 43,0 (C-19), 30,5 (C-20), 176,4 (C-27), 178,6 (C-28), 33,2 (C-29) e 23,5 (C-30) (Table 1). No espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)P ode-se identificar a presenca de dois monossacarideos por meio de seus atomos de hidrogenio anomericos em \\(\\delta\\) 4,13 (d, \\(J\\) = 7.5) e 4,12 (d, \\(J\\) = 7.9), que foram correlacionados no mapa de como \\(g\\)HMQC as atomos de carbonos de carbonos de carbonos de \\({}^{13}\\)C, se presentavamente. A presencia de metila em \\(\\delta\\) 105,2 \\(\\delta\\) 105,3, respectivamente. A presencia de metila em \\(\\delta\\) 1,10 (d, \\(J\\) = 6.0) no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C sugerita a presenca de una unidade de raminose, porem os valores dos deslocamentos quimicos para os atomos de carbono nao eram compativeis aos observados para esse acqicar. No espectro de experimento COSY \\({}^{1}\\)H-H form observados as correlacoes entre os hidrogenio carbinolicos, que foram atribuidos inequivocamente aos ses respects carbons pelo espectro de experimento gHMQC. As constantes de acoplamento observadas para os H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(J\\) = 7.5),H-2 (\\(J\\) = 9.0), H-3\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(J\\) = 9.0) e M-H-4\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(J\\) = 9.0) para ambas as unidades do acjcar indicaram a disposicio diazali dos atomos de hidrogenio de carboidrato (Table 2). Adicionalmente, o espectro de gHMBC apresentou correlacoes entre o H-6\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 1,10 d, \\(J\\) = 6.0) com os C-5\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 75,5) e C-4\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 71,3); o H-2\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 2,94) com o C-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 2,5). A associacao destes dados alidas nos os didieratura permitam identificar a unidade de acjcar como a B-D-quinovi\\({}^{13}\\). A posicao da unidade do acjcar no C-3\\({}^{1}\\) C-3 foi determinada pela correlacao a longa distancia, observada no mapa de contorno gHMBC entre o H-1\\({}^{1}\\) e o C-3\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 88,1). Apos analise dos espectros de RMN e comparacao com os dados da liteatura fotosi posisyl identificar a substancia \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) como cido 3-\\(O\\)-B-D-quinovi\\({}^{13}\\). e a substancia \\(\\mathbf{2}\\) como ocido-3-\\(O\\)-b-D-quinovi\\({}^{13}\\).\n\nO espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C da substancia \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) apresentou sinais que revelaram a presenca de una saponina. Foram observados no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 128,0, 132,5, 55,3, 176,3 178,6 atribuidos aos C-12, C-13, C-14, C-27 e C-28, respectivamente, do esqueleto triterpenico. Alem do sinal de carbono amoriento em \\(\\delta\\) 105,6 (C-1\\({}^{1}\\)), outros sinais referentes a una unidade glacioscide formar observados. Os deslocamentos quimicos destes e dos demais carbons, com suas respectivas multiplicidades, apresentaram valores concordantes com os da literatura para o acidi do 3-\\(O\\)-b-D-glucoprianosdeo-quinocio\\({}^{13}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{3}\\)) (Table 1).\n\nO espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C da mistura \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) + \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) apresentou sinais que indicaram se tratar de una mistura binaria de saponinas triterpenicos. Apos identificado dos sinais attribuylos para a subsimetro \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C observamar-se os sinais para cum segundo cido quinovi\\({}^{12}\\), caracterizado principalmente pelos sinais duplicados em \\(\\delta\\) 55,3 e 56,2; 53,7 e 53,8 atribuidos aos C-14 (\\(\\mathbf{3}\\)), C-18 (\\(\\mathbf{3}\\)) e C-18 (\\(\\mathbf{4}\\)), respectivamente. A diferenca entre as dusa substancias foi evidenciada pelos valores dos deslocamentos quimicos dos atomos de carboso mas unidades de acplicares. O valido de doselocamento quinloco de C-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 4) on 8 94,0 \\(\\delta\\) observado quando a glucose esta lida ao ao C-28, consouchencia de efte de blindagem da carbovia (Table 1). O espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D obtido pela irradiacao no H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 4,13, d, \\(J\\) = 7.5) da glicose exibu correlacoes com os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 2,93, 3.02, 3.05 e 3,10 atribuidos respectivamente aos H-2\\({}^{1}\\), H-4\\({}^{1}\\), H-5' e H-3' da unidade glicosdica ligada ao C-3, da substancia \\(\\mathbf{3}\\). A irradiacao no H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 5,21, d, \\(J\\) = 7.9),p aerum un espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D onde foram observadas as correlacoes com os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 2,89, 2.99 e 3,12, atribuidos aos H-4\\({}^{1}\\), H-2' e H-3', respectivamente, pertencentes a glicose ligada ao C-28 da substancia \\(\\mathbf{4}\\). Os adados obtidos com o espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D aliados asso espectros de gHMQC e gHMBC e auxiliaram na attribuica o iso inequivoca das unidades de glicose. A analise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D e comparacao com os descritos na literatura permitam identificar a substancia \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) como cido 20-\\(\\mathbf{b}\\)-D-glucoprianosdeo quinvoico\\({}^{13}\\).\n\nO flavonoide ramanzina-3-\\(O\\)-rutinosideo (\\(\\mathbf{5}\\)) foi identificado pela comparacao de seus dados espectroscopicos de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C com os registrados na literatura\\({}^{10}\\). A posicao da unidade de b-D-glucose no C-3 foi confirmada pela correlacao os espectro de gHMBC entre o H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 5,38, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0) e o C-3' (\\(\\delta\\) 133,5). A posica do metroula no C-3' doa heel b do flavonide foi confirmada pela correlacao observada entre os a thidrogenio da metroula o da metroula (\\(\\delta\\) 3,83, s) e o C-3' (\\(\\delta\\) 147,0).\n\nA atividade antifringica detectada na fase clorformica das fol- Ihas de _T. brasiliensis_ contra o fungo fitpotagcinco _C. cladosporioides_ pode ser atribuida a presenca de saponinas\n\n**Table 1.** Dados de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C de \\(\\mathbf{1}\\)**, \\(\\mathbf{2}\\)**, \\(\\mathbf{3}\\)**e \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) (DMSO-\\(d_{v}\\) 125 MHz)\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\hline C & \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{2}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 38,8 (t) & 38,8 (t) & 38,6 (t) & 39,0 (t) \\\\\n2 & 24,2 (t) & 25,1 (t) & 24,1 (t) & 24,4 (t) \\\\\n3 & 88,1 (d) & 88,1 (d) & 88,0 (d) & 77,6 (d) \\\\\n4\n\n## Page 3\n\ntriterpenicas. As substancias isoladas e identificadas foram submetidas da nos nos ensios antifingcios, utilizando a tecnica da bioautografia3, para se determinar os limites de deteccao (quandidade minima da amostra, em mg, necessaria para inhibir o crescimento do fungo), sendo utilizados os fungas filamentosos _C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum_ (Tabela 3). As misturas (**1 + 2) e (3 + 4) apresentar antividade moderada (5 mg/mL) contra _C. cladosporioides_ em comparacao com o padrao nistatina (0,5 mg/mL) e nao inibiram o crescimento de _C. sphaerospermum_. Nao foi observada atividade antifingcia para a substancia **3**, este resultado e um indicio de que atividade antifingcica observada para a mistura das saponinas **3 + 4** pode ser atribuda para a saponina **4**.\n\n## Parte experimental\n\n### Proccdimentos esperimentais gerais\n\nOs espectros de RMN form registrados em DMSO-_d__o_, no espectrometro Bruker AC-200 F e Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrao de referencia.

Phtyochemical investigation of the fruits extracts of _Trichilia elegans_ and _Trichilia catigua_ (Meliaceaee) has led to the identification of the limonoids 11b-acetoxybacunone, ecdrelone, methylangelonate and epimeric mixture of photogedunin besides known cameras (scoparone, scopoletin, umbeliferone) and the steroids stigmasterol, b-sitosterol, istostenone and campstered. The structures of the compounds were proposed by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data. An evaluation of the insecticidal activity of the fruits extracts of _Trichilia_ ssp. was carried out and the extracts of _T. elegans_ revealed to have strong insecticidal activity and the extracts of _T. catigua_ showed moderate larval mortality on _Spodoptera frugiperda_.\n\nKeywords: _Trichilia_; limonoids; _Spodoptera frugiperda_.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nO uso de plantas com propriedades insecticides tem se mostrado uma promissora ferramenta no controle de insectos, por causar menor impacto ambiental, o que attende aos anseios da sociedade moderna.1 Detre as especies utilizadas como insecticida, a nim, _Azadirachta indica_ (Meliaceae), e a popularmente mais conhecida e cujo espectro de acao e bastante amplo, tendo sueh efito comprovado sobre aproximadamente 400 especies de insectos.2 A partir dos excelentes resultados verificados com o nim, outras meliacas tambem passaram a despertar o interesse de pesquisadores, no intuito de encontroar novas especies e novas moleculas com atividade inesticida, vias especies de Meliaceae se destacam entre as familias botanica s que apresentam ingredienties attivos com atividade inesticida, proporcionando eficiencia de seus extractos.3 O genero _Trichilia e_ um deles, pois alem de apresentar compostos com atividade insecticidea conhecida (triquilinas),4 c bastante abundante nas regioes tropiciais da America com mais de 230 especies conhecidas.5\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dq.ufscar.br\n\nMikolajczak e Reed+ realizaram um dos primeiros trabalhos testando a atividade inesticida de _Trichilia_ sobre _S. frugiperda_. Os extratos etanolicos de _T. pallida_, _T. comoroides_, _T. prieureana_, _T. roka_ e. _T. triphyllaria_ testados causaram mortalidade igual ou superior a 80% das lagarts, sendo que apenas a diltima especia nao efeto a sobrevivencia o aloseto. Diversos trabalhos comprovando atividade insecticide de _Trichilia_ ssp. sobre _Spodoptera frugiperda_ tem sido realizados.17,8 Atividade biologica sobre insetso de algmus limonoides isolados de especies de _Trichilia_ ven sendo investigada, e resultados promissores foram encontrados.49-11\n\nFootnote †: e-mail: paulo@dq.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAs separacoes cromatograficas em colunas foram realizadas utilizando-se gel de silica 60, 70-230, 230-400 mesh e Sephadex LH-20. As separacoes oper comatografia liquida de alta eficiencia (CLAE) em condicoes preparativas foram realizadas em coluna Asaibnak GS-310 2G (2,15 x 50,0 cm), utilizando equipamento Shimadzu LC-8A com valivula de reciclo, injector Rheodyne 7123 com _loop_ 500 \\(\\mu\\)L e detector UV/VIS Shimadzu SPD-6AV.\n\nAs analises cromatograficas em camada fina foram realizadas em cromatoplacas de silica gel F235 sobre placa de aluminio Merck, de 0.2 mm de espessum, empregado-se como revelador a solucao de vanilina/acido sulfurico.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nOs frutos de _T. elegans_ e _T. catiqua_ foram coletados em Piracica-ba/SP no Campus da Escola Superior de Agricultura \"Luiz de Queiroz\" (Esala/USP) e identificados pelo botanico Dr. Ricardo Ribeiro Rodriguez Rodriguez. Uma exsicata de _T. elegans_ e outra de _T. catiqua_ foram depositadas sob os numeros 80407 e 7394, respectivamente.\n\n## Preparacao dos extratos\n\nOs frutos secos (84,0 g) e modios de _T. elegans_ foram extrados a temperatura ambiente e em repouso, com solventes em ordem crescente de polaridade (hexano, MeOH e MeOH/agua 1:1). As solucoes obtidas foram concentradas por destilaaco do solvente em evaporador rotativo, formecendo extratos hexanico, metamolico e indrometanolico. Os frutos de _T. catiqua_ foram separados em arilo (3,5 g), semente (8,0 g) e exocarpo (3,0 g) e, posteriormente, secos e modos. A extracao das partes dos frutos de _T. catiqua_ foi realizada utilizando as mesmas condicoes descritas para os frutos de _T. elegans_. Os extratos foram submetidos a ensaios biologicos sobre a lagarta-do-carutcho _S. frugiperda_ e os que apresentaram attividade foram fracionados.\n\n## Isolamento das substancias de _T. elegans_\n\nO extrato hexanico dos frutos de _T. elegans_ (4,20 g) foi submetido a cromatografia em coluna liquida a vacuo empactodan com silica gel (230-400 mesh), utilizando-se como fases moveis solvents organicos de polaridade crescente: hexano, hexano/AcOE1 9:1; AcOEte MeOH. Foram obtidas 4 fracoes apos evaporacao dos solventes organicos: FHI = 20 mg; FH2 = 2800 mg; FH3 = 970 mg e FH4 = 245 mg. A fracao FH3 foi submetida a varios fractionamentos em coluna de sslica gel (70-230 mesh), eluida com CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0-50,0%); MeOH), em gradiente de polaridade crescente formecendo as substancias **1** (1,0 mg), **2** (1,0 mg), **3** (1,6 mg) e a mistura dos esteroides (8,0 mg).\n\nO extrato metamolico dos frutos de _T. elegans_ (5,20 g) foi suspenso em una mistura MeOH/H2O e particionado sucessivamente com CH2Cl2, AcOE1 e _n_-BuOH. Foram obtidas 3 fracoes apos\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & & & & & & Mortalidade da fase larval (\\%) \\\\  & & Controle & Hexánico & Metanólico & Hidrometanólico \\\\ _T. catiqua_ & Sementes & 6,67 & 56,67 & 43,33 & 53,33 \\\\  & Arilo & 6,67 & NT & 10,00 & 13,33 \\\\  & Exocarpo & 6,67 & 13,33 & 13,33 & 23,33 \\\\ _T. elegans_ & Frutos & 10,00 & 100,00 & 100,00 & 33,33 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Mortalidade da fase larval de _S. frugiperda_ alimentada com dieta artificial tratada com extratos de _Trichilia_ spp., a 1000 mg kg−1\n\n## Page 3\n\nOs extratos hexanico e metanolico de frutos de _T. elegans_ aperentaran mortalidade similar no extrato quaquos das semetenes de _Azadirachta indica_ sobre larvas de _S. exempla_, demonstrando ser um poderoso insecticide.14 Uma alta taxa de mortalidade representa uma dastividades insecticides mais efciencias, j4 que atua logo nas primeiras fases da praga, diminuindo seu ataque na cultura e contribuindo para o decrescimo das populacoes subequentes. Assim, o estudo deste extrato e de suma importancia, seja na sua forma bruta ou visando o isolamento de seus constitutites quimicos.\n\nAo se fracionar o extrato metanolico de frutos de _T. elegans_ forman isoladas as cumarinas (**1-3**) e o limoniodic (**4**), de extrato hexanico foram isoladas as mesmas cumarinas e os esteroides. Ha an literatura relatos de atividade antialimentar de furanocumarinas sobre _S. exigua_16 e _S. litura_.17\n\nApesar da baixa atividade inseticida do extrato metanolico do arila de _T. catigua_ (10%, Tabela 1) este fori fracionado e foi possivel isolar os limonoides cedrelona (**5**), angolensato de metila (**6**) e a mistura epimercia de fotogeluma (**7 e 8**).\n\nO estudo quimico do extrato hexanico dos frutos de _T. elegans_ resultou no isolamento e identificacao das cumarinas escoporona (**1**), escopoletina (**2**), umbeliferena (**3**) e na identificacao da mistura dos esteroides: b-sitosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol eistenon-na. As estruturas das cumarinas escoporona (**1**), escopoletina (**2**), umbeliferena (**3**) foram elucidadas com base nas andiseles dos dados de EM, RMN 1H 1C, alema comparacao com dados publicados anteriormente.18 A mistura dos esteroides foi identificataravdes de analises por CG-EM, comparando-se os espectros de massas obtidos com os espectros existentes no banco de dados de equipamento, por RMN 1H e 13C e tambem por comparacao com dados da literatura.19 O cromatograma de ions totais da analise por CG-EM apresentou 4 picos. O espectro de massas dos picos correspondentes apresentou ions mnoleculares em _m/z_ 414, 412, 400 e 412, concordantes com os espectros de massas do istosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol e sitostenona, respectivamente, sendo o esterolde sitostenorol o composto majoritario desta mistura.\n\nA fracao de _T. elegans_ em AcOEt, resultante da particao do extrato metanolico dos frutos formeceu o limonoide 11b-acetoikonaconna (**4**) cuja estrutura foi caracterizada atraves de dados formecidos pelo espectros de RMN 1H e 13C 1D e 2D (HSQC, HMBC, Tabela 2), envolvendo comparacoes com dados descritos na literatura13,30 para compostos com estrutas semelinantes de imionode (**4**). Esta a primeira vez que os dados de RMN 1H e 13C de limonodice 11b-acetoikonaconna (**4**) esta escho apresentados. No espectro de RMN 1H da substancia **4** form observados sinas em 8 7,40-7,42 (m, H-21 e H-23) e 6,35 (s, H-22) ppm caracteristicos do enel furano. As atribucoes dos C-20 (d 119,5), C-21 (d 141,1), C-22 (d 109,6) e C-23 (d 143,3) doa el furano foram realizadas atraves de RMN 1C e confirmadas atraves do mapa de correlacoes HSQC e HMBC.

Estas informacoes permitam estabelecer a configuracao relativa da inedita citocalasina **1**.\n\nAs substancias **2-6** form identificadas pela analise por EM, RMN de 'H e '1C, gHMQC, gHMQC, gGOSY e NOESY e por comparacao com dados descritros na literatura.13\n\nAs citocalasinas **1-6** (Figure 1) foram availadas quanto atividade antifinicas, frente aos fungos ftopologicos _Cladosporium clados-poioides e C. sphaerospermum_, usando-se o metodo da autoibografia direta.14 A substancia **5** movetu uma fraca atividade na concentracao de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrao nistatina (1 mg mL 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentarum-se inativas.\n\nAs substancias **1-6** form ensaiadas frente a linhagem mutante de _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica nao serem as responsaveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15\n\nA avaliacao da attividade citorakica de **1-6** foi realizada em celulas de maniforacos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cervix humano) e CHO (ovario de hamster chines).16 Para a linhagem aao cancergerica CHO, as substancias **2**, **3**, **5** e **6** apresentam IC50, de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As ciocalasinas **1** e **4** nao apresentaram IC50 nas concentracoes testadas, sendo que **1** foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada com padrao com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1.\n\nNa linhagem cancerigena HeLa as substancias **1-6** apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente.

Forma obtidas ese linagenes puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Quimica Organica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como _Xylaria_ sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Colecao Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292.\n\n## Cultivo em meio liquido e obtencao dos extratos brutos\n\nO fungo endofittico _Xylaria_ sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 das. A seguir foi inculado em 20 fixesos de Erlenmeyer s (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentracao de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantios em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 degC por 28 das. Apos este periodo o caldo foi separado do micelio por filtarxio, extradao com ACoEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extrado com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fracao CHCl, (0,7 g).\n\n## Isolamento das citocalasins\n\nA fracao CHCl, (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de silica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco fracoes: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1).

Pirani4\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from _Trypanosoma cruzi_ was evaluated at 100 mg/mL. Forty-six extracts were tested and fifteen of them showed significant inhibitory activity (IA % >= 50). The majority of the assayed extracts of Meliaceae plants (_Cedrela fissilis, Cipadessa fruticosa_ and _Trichilin ramalho_) showed high activity to inhibit the enzymatic activity. The fractionation of the hexane extract from branches of C. _fruticosa_ led to the isolation of three flavonoids: flavone, 7-methoxyflavone and 3',4',5',5',7-pentametheoxyflavone. The two last compounds showed high ability to inhibit the gGAPDH activity. Therefore, the assayed Meliaceae species could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against Chagas' disease.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nChagas' disease, caused by the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, affects some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25 % of the total population are at risk of contamination (WHO, 2007). Control of the insect vector (_Triatoma infestans_) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and as consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are the major causes for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). Its treatment is still a challenge, since the only drug commercially available (benzmidazole) has strong side effects (De Castro, 1993).\n\nThe bloodstream form of parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae possesses a microbody-like\n\n## Page 2\n\norganelle, where glycolysis takes place, the glycosome (Opperdoes & Borst, 1977). The bloodstream form of the parasite _T. cruzi_ has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production. This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design (Souza et al., 1998). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) is a glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BGP). The three dimensional structure of _T. cruzi_ gGAPDH previously determined shows differences, when compared to the homologous human enzyme that could be exploited for selective inhibition (Souza et al., 1998).\n\nThe need for the development of more efficient drugs against Chagas' disease has stimulated us to initiate a project aiming at the discovery of lead compounds from several plants of Rutales order. In this way, we have proposed the utilization of the glycolytic enzyme gGAPDH as a target for the search of new natural trypanocides (Tomazela et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Pavao et al., 2002; Moraes et al., 2003). In this paper, we report the gGAPDH inhibition activity of 46 crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants, along with three flavones isolated from an active fraction.\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe fruits, branches, stems, roots, and leaves of _Cedrela fissillis_ Vell. were collected in 01/06/01 in Sao Carlos (Sao Paulo, Brazil) and identified by Dr. Maria Ines Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, where a voucher specimen (6701) was deposited. The fruits, branches and leaves of _Cipadessa fruiticosa_ BI. were collected in 01/20/01 in Vicosa (Minas Gerais, Brazil) and identified by Dr. Jose R. Pirani from the Department of Botany, Universidade de Sao Paulo and deposited at the herbarium from this department with a voucher number 110.664. The branches of _Almeidea coerulea_ A. St.-Hil., _Conchocarpus heterophyllus_ (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani, _Galipea carinata_ Pirani (sp. nov.) and _Trichilia ramalhoi_ Rizzini were collected in Southeastern Brazil, and identified by Dr. Jose R. Pirani from the Department of Botany, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil. The specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of that Department. The voucher numbers and the dates of collection were described in Ambrozin et al. (2004).\n\n### Preparation of crude extracts\n\nThe powdered air-dried plant material (branches, fruits, leaves, roots, and/or stems) was extracted by maceration three times with hexane, at room temperature for 72 h. This process was repeated with dichloromethane and methanol for _C. fissillis_ and _C. fruiticosa_, and only with methanol for the other species. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed on _T. cruzi_ gGAPDH enzyme.\n\n### Isolation of compounds\n\nThe hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (12.2 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-dichloromethane-ethyl acetate-methanol gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with a hexane-dichloromethane-acetone gradient to give 9 fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane-dichloromethane-acetone (6:3:1), affording 9 fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds **1** (16.7 mg) and **2** (8.2 mg). Fraction 6 was twice submitted to column chromatography with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (6:3:1) giving compound **3** (30.6 mg). Compounds **1-3** were characterized by comparison of 13C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975; Passador et al., 1997) and submitted to the enzymatic assay.\n\n### Preparation and purification of recombinant _T. cruzi_ gGAPDH\n\nTcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as reported by Souza et al. (1998). It is maintained in the Crystallography Laboratory of the Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.\n\n_T. cruzi_ gGAPDH inhibitory activity\n\ngGAPDH activity was determined according to a previously reported procedure (Barbosa & Nakano, 1987; Vieira et al., 2001). Reduced NADH was spectrophotometrically measured at 340 nm during 30 s. The reaction medium contains 50 mmol L-1 Tris-HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 \\(\\beta\\)-mercaptoethanolanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD-, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 0.15 mg protein, in a total volume of 500 mL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate. The extracts were tested at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL.\n\n## RESULTS\n\nIn this work, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of 46 extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on _T. cruzi_ gGAPDH enzyme (Table 1). Fifteen of them showed high ability in inhibit the enzyme (IA % >= 50) at 100 mg/mL.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFGH) and the methanol extracts from Meliaceae plants were the most active ones, whereas the extracts from Rutaceae did not present significant results.\n\nThe investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction (inhibitory activity = 81.9 % at 100 mg/mL) from the hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFGH) led to the isolation of three flavonoids: flavone (**1**), 7-methoxyflavone (**2**) and 3',4',5',5',7-pentamethoxyflavone (**3**). The flavones **1** and **2** were assayed (Table 2) and the results showed that only **2** presented high inhibitory activity against gGAPDH enzyme.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe results indicated that, among the assayed species, _C. fissilis_, _C. fruticosa_ and _Trichilia ramalhoi_ are promising sources of lead compounds for the rational design of new trypanocidal drugs. The inhibitory activity of the flavones **1** and **2** against gGAPDH has been reported for the first time. Recently, Ambrozin et al. (2004) published their activity against trypanostigote forms of _T. cruzi_ and Tadesmir et al. (2006) described the trypanocidal activity of some flavones. A previous study showed that compound **3** completely inhibited the gGAPDH activity at 268.8 mmol/L (Tomazela et al., 2000). Thus, the activity of the studied extract (CFGH) (Table 1) is probably related to the presence of the active flavones **2** and **3**. However, their enzymatic activity were considered weak, particularly in comparison with chalepin, a coumarin isolated from _Pilocarpus spicatus_ (Rutaceae), which reduced the gGAPDH activity by 75 % at 93 mmol/L (IC50 = 64 mmol/L) (Vieira et al., 2001; Pavao et al., 2002; Menezes et al., 2003; Moraes et al., 2003; Leittao et al., 2004).\n\nSimilar studies involving the enzyme gGAPDH have been reported by our group. Vieira et al. (2001) showed the enzymatic activity of several plants of Rutaceae and Meliaceae families and thirteen coumarins isolated from different species, which are considered as one of the most promising class of substances with gGAPDH inhibitory activity. Moreover, the gGAPDH activity of several flavonoids isolated from Meliaceae, Rutaceae and Leguminosae plants, including pyrano chalcones, flavones, flavanones, flavonoids and isoflavones, have also been reported (Tomazela et al., 2000; Moraes et al., 2003). Recently, Januario et al. (2005) described the activity of 7-hydroxy-4',6-dimethoxyisoflavone on gGAPDH. All these data support the hypothesis that highly oxygenated flavones possess the structural requirements to inhibit gGAPDH.\n\nThe family Meliaceae is characterized by the frequent occurrence of limonoids (da Silva et al., 1984). This class of compounds has been attracted considerable interest because of their biological properties and diversity of structures (Champagne et al., 1992).\n\nPrevious studies of _C. fissilis_ showed the isolation of limonoids and triterpenes (Taylor, 1984; Zelnik, 1966, 1970; Leite et al., 2005a; Ambrozin et al., 2006) and _C. fruticosa_ has been reported to contain _ent_-clerodanes and labdanes diterpenoids (Rojatkar and Nagasampagi, 1994; Rojatkar et al., 1994), limonoids, steroids, sesquiterpenoids, henicosene derivatives and one coumarin (Luo et al., 2000, 2001; Leite et al., 2005a,b). There are no phytochemical studies about _T. ramalhoi_, but several compounds have been isolated from the _Trichilia_ genus, such as, limonoids (Cortez et al., 1992; Garcez et al., 1997; Garcez, et al., 2000; Cortez et al., 2000), lignin glycosides (Cortez et al., 1998), o-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids (Pupo et al., 1996), terpenoids, steroids (Pupo et al., 2002; Pupo et al., 1996) and g-lactones (Pupo et al., 1998). Phytochemical studies with other active extracts from these plants are in progress and shall reveal molecules that can be used as potential lead compounds in the search for potent and selective _T. cruzi_ gGAPDH inhibitors.\n\nIn conclusion, most of the active extracts belong to the family Meliaceae. New investigations with these extracts are undertaken in order to find inhibitors that could act as potential lead molecules on the described assay. Moreover, the isolated flavonoids bring about the enzymatic inhibition, showing that these compounds are potential lead molecules for the development of new drugs against Chagas' disease.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES) and Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) for the financial support.\n\nFigure 1: Compounds isolated from _Cipadessa_\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline Family/species & Plant part & Extraction solvent & Crude extract & IA \\% \\\\ \\hline MELIACEAE & & & \\\\ _Cedrela fissills_ & fruits & hexane & CFRH & 50.8 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CFRD & 70.7 \\\\  & & methanol & CFRM & 94.0 \\\\  & branches & hexane & CGH & 32.4 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CGD & 85.4 \\\\  & & methanol & CGM & 93.2 \\\\  & stems & hexane & CCH & 25.4 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CCD & 9.8 \\\\  & & methanol & CCM & 94.2 \\\\  & roots & hexane & CRH & 3.1 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CRD & 5.0 \\\\  & & methanol & CRM & 94.4 \\\\  & leaves & hexane & CFH & 36.2 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CFD & 65.5 \\\\  & & methanol & CFM & 91.6 \\\\  & fruits & hexane & CFFRH & 12.2 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CFFRD & 9.6 \\\\  & & methanol & CFFRM & 84.8 \\\\  & branches & hexane & CFGH & 98.3 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CFGD & 11.7 \\\\  & & methanol & CFGM & 90.2 \\\\  & leaves & hexane & CFFH & 0 \\\\  & & dichloromethane & CFFD & 0 \\\\  & & methanol & CFFM & 66.7 \\\\  & branches & hexane & TRGH & 9.7 \\\\  & & methanol & TRGM & 95.3 \\\\  & & hexane & TRFH & 73.5 \\\\  & & methanol & TRFM & 92.4 \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\  & & & & \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: gGAPDH inhibitory activity of Meliaceae and Rutaceae extracts at 100 μg/mL.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\n\n\n## References\n\n* Ambrozin et al.

As fracoes form monitoradas via RMN 'H e ESI-EM/EM e foram analisadas somente aquelas eujos espectros apresentavam caracteristicas de alcaloides do acido antranfilico e flavonoides nao isolados anteriormente. Foram isolados do caule os alcaloides flindersina, skimminaina, 8-metoxifillersina e dictamnina; das folhas os flavonoides 3',4',7,8-tetrametoxi-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimtiplirano)-flavona, 3',4',5,7,8-pentametoxiflavona, 5-hidroxi-3',4',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona, 3',4'-metilendiodioxi-5,6,7-trimetoxiflavona e-3',4'-metilendiodioxi-6,7-dimetoxiflavona., Os alcaloides do acido antranfilico nao foram encentrodas em deza.\n\nVarios flavonoides isolados de N. paracensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, enxerto de _Citrus sinensis_ (Rutaceae) e _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) forum testados frente a gliceraldehyde-3-fosfato desidrogenase de _Trypamosoma cruzi_, visando verificar seus potenciais em inibir a attividade da enzima. Os flavonoides polimetoxidados e um isoflavononide foram os mais attivos.\n\nOur taxonomic interest in the _Neoraputia_ stimulated an investigation of _N. paraensis_ searching for alkaloids. Fractions were monitored by 'H NMR and ESI-MS/MS and only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. Stems afforded the alkaloids finderine, skimminaine, 8-metohydroylindersine and dictamine; leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethylo-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone, 3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethyloflavone, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years.\n\nA number of flavonoids isolated from _N. paraensis_, _N. magnifica_, _Murraya paniculata_, _Citrus sinensis_ graft (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Highly oxygenated flavones and isoflavone were the most actives.\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Neoraputia_ species were originally described by Engler as species of _Raputia_ Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus _Neoraputia_ Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them from _Raputia_ and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae.1 Previous investigations of _Neoraputia_ reported the presence of eleven polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavones, one 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone and one flavanone from _N. alba_ (Engler) Emmerich;23 five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6-pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-polymethoxylated chalcones from _N.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nmagnifica_ var. _magnifica_ (Engler) Emmerich;4,5 ten polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavones and one 6-(3\"-hydroxy.3\"-methyl-\\(trans\\)-but-1\"-enyl)-flavone from _N. paraensis_.6,7 All phytochemical studies on _Neoraputia_ genus have been undertaken in our laboratory and by Arruda _et al_.6,7, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. If Emmerich'proposal is correct, that _Neoraputia_ is a Cusparieae member, then this genus can be regarded as a potential source of anthranilate alkaloids. Thus, it would be not surprising if anthranilate alkaloids had remained undiscovered in the _Neoraputia_ because of their low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove _Neoraputia_ to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated flavones.4,8 Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of _Neoraputia_ species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. In order to establish this we have now undertaken a further investigation of _N. paraensis_.\n\nChagas' disease, caused by the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organisation). Control of the insect vector (_Triatoma infestans_) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side effects.9 The bloodstream form of the parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_ has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production.9 This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined.9 Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with significant differences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested.9\n\nHighly oxygenated flavones from _Neoraputia_\\(magnifica\\) have shown to be the most actives as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor.5 These data stimulated an investigation of other flavonoids. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, flavonoids isolated from _Neoraputia_\\(paraensis\\), _N. magnifica_, _Murraya paniculata_, _Citrus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from _Trypanosoma cruzi_.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nOur taxonomic interest in the _Neoraputia_ stimulated an investigation of the extracts from stems and leaves of _N. paraensis_ searching for alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff's reagent on TLC plates. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations.\n\nThe dichloromethane extract from stems afforded only the alkaloid flindserine (**1**).10 The HSQC and HMBC experiments on flindserine, permitted minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments.10 Table 1 shows that the signals for C-3 and C-10 to C-12 were reassigned. The observed correlations between the methine hydrogen signal at d 6.77 and the 13C signals at d 162.5, 157.3 and 79.1 led to their assignments as C-2, C-4, C-13, respectively. The upfield methine hydrogen signal at d 5.56 showed correlation with the 13C signals at d 105.8, 79.1 and 26.3 permitting the assignment of these signals to C-3, C-13 and C-14/15, respectively. The signals at d 6.77 and 5.56 were then assigned to H-11 and H-12, respectively.\n\nThe methanolic extract from stems afforded skimminanine,11 8-methoxyfildersine (**2**)12 and dictamine.13,14 As no carbon shifts of **2** could be found in the literature, these data are listed in Table 1. Complete and unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for **2** were made using the HSQC and HMBC techniques and using **1** and haplophytin A (**3**)15 as a models. The methine hydrogen signal at d 6.71 showed correlation with the 13C signals at d 157.1 permitting the assignment of these signals to H-11 and C-4. Thus, in compound **1** and **2**, H-11 is more deshielded than H-12. However, in model **3** the presence of the methoxyl at C-5 caused downfield shift of the usual range for 4,O-3-chromene quinolines, resulting in the H-12 being more deshielded than H-11. The methoxyl at C-5 also induces effects on C-10 and C-3, exhibiting upfield displacement for C-10 and downfield displacement for C-3. These data were also confirmed by HMBC experiments.15\n\nThe _n_-hexane extract of the leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethyl-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone3 (**4**) which has not been recorded from _N. paraensis_. The dichloromethane extract from leaves gave four flavonoids,\n\n## Page 3\n\n3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone16 (**5**), 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethyl flavone17 (**6**), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone5 (**7**) and **8**, which are reported for the first time from _N. paraensis_, while the latter appears to be new.\n\nThe flavone **8** exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 'H NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3',4'-substitution (\\(\\delta\\) 7.33, d, \\(J\\) 1.8 Hz, H-2'; \\(\\delta\\) 6.93, d, \\(J\\) 8.2 Hz, H-5'; \\(\\delta\\) 7.46, dd, \\(J\\) 8.2 and 1.8 Hz, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for two methoxy groups (\\(\\delta\\) 3.97, s; 3.92, s), one methylenedioxy group (\\(\\delta\\) 6.08, s, 2H), one hydroxyl group at \\(\\delta\\) 12.73 (1H, s, OH-5) and two singlets at \\(\\delta\\) 6.54 (H-8) and 6.55 (H-3) indicating the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted and a flavone nucleus. The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)17 fragments in ESI-MS/MS of this flavone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B-rings. Thus, a combination of 'H NMR data and the fragment ions at _m/z_ 146 (30%) and 181 (RDA-Me, 100%) fully supported the presence of 3',4'-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy or 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-OH-7,8- and 5-OH-6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-OH-3,7,8- and 5-OH-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavonol indicated that C-6 methine (_ca._\\(\\delta\\) 96) resonates at lowerfield than C-8 methine (_ca._\\(\\delta\\) 91).18 Thus,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} Atom & \\(\\mathbf{8^{\\rm a}}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{9^{\\rm a}}\\).18 & \\(\\mathbf{10^{\\rm b}}\\).5 \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) (_J_) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\n\n## Page 4\n\nthe correct A-ring was decided on the basis of 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which showed signal at d 90.6 for C-8, so placing the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-6. From these data **8** was characterised as 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone (**9**)18 and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone (**10**).5\n\nPreliminary work was firstly undertaken on specimens collected in Paragominas, state of Para, north of Brazil, in February 1991.6,7 The present results obtained from specimens originating from Uruyuca, Bahia (February 1993), showed that there was no difference in the flavonoids between the two collections. However, alkaloids were obtained only from plants of northeast region (Bahia), which is characterized by drought summer, compared to rainy summer in the northern (Para). In contrast, _Neoraputia alba_ and _N. magnifica_ collected in Espirito Santo, near northeast of Brazil, had only high concentration of flavonoids. Thus, geographic-variation do not seem to be an important environmental factor. The low concentration of anthranilate alkaloids is likely to be responsible for the alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. All alkaloids were obtained in very small amounts (1-3 mg), only flindersine (**1**) was present in substantial amounts (10 mg).\n\nIn a previous paper concerning the chemical systematics of Cusparieae, which _Neoraputia_ has been assigned,8 the importance of coumarins and anthranilate alkaloids was highlighted. This study brings into focus polyoxygenated flavonoids as another taxonomically useful chemical marker in this group. Many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds presents in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far.\n\nA number of flavonoids isolated from _Neoraputia paraensis_, _N. magnifica_,45_Murraya paniculata_,19_Cirus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon20_ (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus21 (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from _Trypanosoma cruzi_. The positive results are summarized at Table 3 and the occurrence of flavonoids evaluated at Table 4. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 65% when 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethyl-5',6'-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (**11**) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 _m_g mL-1, suggesting that chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The flavones 3',4',5',5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (**12**), 3',4',5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone (**13**), 4',5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (**14**) and flavonoid 3',4',5',3,5,6,7-heptamethoxyflavonol (**15**) completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 99-100%) at 100 _m_g mL-1. The activity does not appear to be affected by the introduction of the 3-OMe substituent into the flavone\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound & Concentration (_μ_g mL−1) & Absorbance & Specific activity (U mg−1) & \\% Inhibitory activity \\\\\n**4** & 35 & 0.249 & 14.69 & 68 \\\\ Control & 35 & 0.773 & 45.61 & \\\\\n**5** & 50 & 0.312 & 22.38 & 45 \\\\ Control & 50 & 0.568 & 40.62 & \\\\\n**7** & 50 & 0.606 & 43.28 & 0 \\\\  & 100 & 0.395 & 28.18 & 36 \\\\ Control & 50 & 0.594 & 42.42 & \\\\  & 100 &\n\n## Page 5\n\nskeleton. However, the activity of 3',4',5',3,5,7,8-heptamethoxyflavonol (**16**) was comparable to that of **15** but, reducing the enzymatic activity by 88% at 100 _m_g mL-1. This finding shows that the activity varies with the position of methoxyl group. The higher activity of **12**, **13**, **14** and **15** could possibly be attributed to a greater symmetry of electron density of the molecules. Flavones 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone (**10**) and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (**7**) do not display significant GAPDH activity (26% and 36%, respectively) showing that 3',4'-methylenedioxy reduce drastically inhibitory activity. Differences between polyoxygenated flavones and isoflavone afromosine (**17**) inhibitory activities are not significant, indicating that the presence of many methoxy groups in isoflavones are not a requirement for activity. However, isoflavone possess 3-phenylchromone skeleton and it may be incorrect to compare it with the other flavones tested. GAPDH activity was also inhibited by 96% when auroralordirobtusone A (**18**) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 _m_g mL-1.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Compound & Family/Species & References \\\\\n**4** & Rutaceae \\\\\n**4** & _Neoraputia alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. parensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**5** & _N. alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**7** & _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**10** & _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\\n**11** & _N. magnifica_ & 4, 5 \\\\\n**12** & _N. alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 6, 7 \\\\\n**13** & _Citrus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ & 20 \\\\\n**14** & _C. sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ & 20 \\\\\n**15** & _Murraya paniculata_ & 19 \\\\\n**16** & _M. paniculata_ & 19 \\\\  & Leguminosae \\\\\n**17** & _Lonchocarpus montanus_ & 21 \\\\\n**18** & _L. montanus_ & 21 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Occurrence of flavonoids evaluated on TcGAPDH activity \n\n## Page 6\n\nThus, clearly isoflavonoids and auronoids deserve more attention as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitors. Highly oxygenated flavones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal GAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavonoids and the enzyme GAPDH.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General\n\nNMR on a Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard. HSQC, Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence; ESI-MS/MS, low resolution on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument, equipped with a \"Z-spray\" ion source; R-HPLC, Recycling High-Performance Liquid Chromatography on a model Shimadzu LC-6AD; detection (Shimadzu SPD-6AV), UV.\n\n### Plant material\n\n#### Neoraputia paraensis\n\nwas collected in Uruuca, Bahia, Brazil, and a voucher (SPF 81-316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias, USP, Sao Paulo.\n\n#### Isolation of compounds\n\nGround stems (2700 g) and leaves (409 g) of _Neoraputia paraensis_ were extracted with _n_-hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. Only the concentrated extracts containing alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragondorff's reagent on thin-layer chromatography plates, were worked. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations.\n\nThe concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from stem was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel. Elution with a _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1:0.2) afforded 16 fractions. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording **1** (10 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The concentrated CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography over silanized silica elution with MeOH-H2O (1:1) afforded 10 fractions. Fraction 8 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient affording 2 fractions. Fraction 1 was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (5:0.4:0.4) and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (4.6:0.4) affording skimmianine (3 mg). Fraction 2 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 A pore diameter; eluant: CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1); flow rate: 4.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, 254 nm) to give **2** (second peak, 1.2 mg) and dictamnine (first peak, 1.0 mg), after four cycles of 80 min.\n\nThe concentrated _n_-hexane extract of the leaves was four times flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient, _n_-hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, _n_-hexane-EtOAc gradient, and finally with silica gel and Florisil (1:1) eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording **4** (20 mg).\n\nThe concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shocke Asahipack GS-310P; eluant: MeOH; flow rate: 5.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, \\(l\\) 240 nm) to give **8** (second peak, 2.7 mg), after three cycles of 60 min. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 also were purified by R-HPLC (as above; flow rate: 6.0 mL min-1) to give **5** (second peak, 5.0 mg), **6** (second peak, 4.0 mg) and **7** (second peak, 3.0 mg) after three cycles of 60 min, respectively.\n\nHydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyeflavone (**8**).

The reaction medium was 50 mmol L-1 Tris-HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 _b_-mercaptoethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD*, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 4-9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 _m_L. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme.\n\nThe specific activity (unit = U) of the enzyme was calculated as:\n\n\\[(\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}) = \\{(\\Delta\\text{ absorbance}/\\Delta\\text{ t})\\text{ x volume of cell}\\}/6.22\\text{ x volume of enzyme x [ enzyme] where \\(\\Delta\\text{ t}\\) = 0.5 min; volume of cell = 1.00 mL; 'NADH = 6.22 (mmol L-1)-1 cm-1; volume of enzyme = 0.005 mL; [enzyme] concentration of enzyme in mg mL-1.\n\n### _T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity_\n\nThe inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 _m_L. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30s interval. Flavonoids were tested at 50 and 100 _m_g mL-1 in 10% DMSO using 5 _m_L of GAPDH at 0.90 mg mL-1.\n\nIn each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO in the reaction medium and was used as the positive control. The specific activity of TcGAPDH was not significantly affected by the presence of 10% DMSO.\n\nData were means of 3 repetitions and values as percent of control were used as follows:\n\n\\[\\%\\text{ inhibitory activity} = \\{(\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ control} - \\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ compound})/\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ control}\\}\\text{ x 100}\\]\n\nEnzymatic inhibition studies have been carried out in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.\n\nSome of the potentially active substances, as flavones **6** and **8**, can not be assayed with the standard procedure described here, due to problems of solubility in the reaction buffer and absorption of light close to the wavelength used to observe the reaction course (340 nm). To overcome these limitations an alternative technique is being developed, based on calorimetric measurements, similar to procedures adopted with other enzymes.24\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES).

(Rutaceae) afforded two new compounds 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2_H_-pyran-2-one and _rel-(7R,8R)_-8-[(_E_)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofluoro[2,3-b]quinoline-7-yl acetate, along with the known compounds arborinine, \\(N\\)-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone, skimimanine, kokusagine, isodutaprine, isoskinaminine, and isokousagine. Their structures were established based on their spectral data, and for the new compounds these data are described herein. Additionally, these compounds were assayed on the triopmastigote forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ showing moderate trypanocidal activity.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe genus _Almeidea_ belongs to Rutaceae family and is widely distributed in Brazil. Data about the secondary metabolites of this genus are available. From _Almeidea guyanensis_ was isolated \\(C\\)-arabinosyl flavones, 2- and 4-quinolones, and flavone \\(C\\)-glycosides.[1] We have previously reported the isolation of triterpenoids, acridone, 2-quinolone, and fluoroquinoline alkaloids, and a new tetrahydrouquinoline alkaloid from _A. coerulea_ and _A. rubra_[2] besides steroids, one sesquiterpene, one cromone, and one flavone.[3]\n\nChagas' disease (American Trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, affecting more than 18 million people in Latin America.[4] Its treatment is still a challenge and new less toxic and more effective drugs are necessary.\n\nAs a part of our search for new trypanocidal compounds and our studies on the chemistry of Rutaceae, a new specimen of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. was investigated. Thus, here we report the isolation, identification and characterization of two new substances (**1** and **2a**) and seven known compounds (**3-9**) from methanol extract of leaves of this plant, in addition to their trypanocidal activities.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of\n\n## Page 2\n\nmethanol extract from leaves of _A. rubra_ afforded two new compounds (**1** and **2a**) and known compounds (Figure 1) arborinine (**3**), _N_-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone (**4**),5 skimmianine (**5**),6 kokusagine (**6**),7 isodotudaprine (**7**),8 isoskimminanine (**8**), and isokkusagine (**9**), which were identified through comparison of their NMR spectral data with the literature.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a yellow powder and its structure was determined by analysis of NMR and LRMS.\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of **1** showed aromatic protons at \\(d\\) 7.33 (2H, m), and 6.70 (2H, m), assigned to H-4', H-6', and H-3', H5', respectively. Two olefinic protons (H-3 and H-5) appeared at \\(d\\) 5.49, and 6.23 (d, \\(J\\) 2.2 Hz) assigned to an 2-pyrone by comparison with a styryl-2-pyrone described by Pizzolatti _et al._,9 besides broad _N_-H and _N_-CH3 signals at \\(d\\) 5.36, and 2.87. Furthermore, a singlet at \\(d\\) 3.85 (3H) revealed the presence of the methoxyl group in the molecule.\n\nThe 13C NMR spectrum of **1** showed 13 carbons, distinguished as 5 quaternaries (_d_ 171.7, 164.0, 162.8, 147.6, 116.0), 4 aromatics (_d_ 132.3, 129.2, 116.4, 111.2), 2 ofelines (_d_ 100.1, 87.3), 1 methoxyl (_d_ 55.9), and 1 _N_-methyl carbon (_d_ 30.4). The analysis of 13C NMR and HSQC spectrum allowed us to attribute undoubtedly all chemical shifts to methyl, vinyl, and aromatic carbons/hydrogens of **1** (Table 1).\n\nThe assignments of quaternary carbons were possible from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-2' was deduced from 3\\(J\\) correlation between _N_-CH3 hydrogens (_d_ 2.87) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 147.6. C-4 (_d_ 171.7) was assigned through 3\\(J\\) correlation between the lowerfield carbon and methoxyl hydrogens (_d_ 3.85). Furthermore, C-6 (_d_ 162.8) and C-1' (_d_ 116.0) were determined through 2_J_-_J_ correlation to H-5 (_d_ 6.23). Finally, through the 2\\(J\\) correlation between H-3 (_d_ 5.49) and a carbonyl carbon at \\(d\\) 164.0 was attributed C-2.\n\nAll these results allowed us to propose the structure 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2_H_-pyran-2-one for compound **1**, which is described for the first time in the literature and represents a new class of compounds formed by the reaction of anthranilic acid and two acetyl/malonyl-CoA units.\n\nSingle crystal X-ray diffraction established undoubtedly the structure of **1** as a derivative of anthranilic acid (Figure 2).\n\nThe crystal structure of compound **1** shows the presence of two independent molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure 2). The main conformational difference between both independent molecules is centered in the dihedral angle between the least square planes that pass through the aromatic rings in each molecule. The value of this angle in molecule 1 is 33.58(8)deg and in molecule 2 is 34.79(8)deg. The crystal structure also shows the presence of one intramolecular interaction in each molecule. These interactions are slightly different due to the conformation\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & HSQC & & HMBC \\\\ Carbon & _δ_c & _δ_H (_J_Ca) & _χ_Ca & _χ_Ca \\\\\n2 & 164.0 & & & \\\\\n3 & 87.3 & 5.49 d (_J_ 2.2 Hz) & 171.7, 164.0 & 100.1 \\\\\n4 & 171.7 & & & \\\\\n5 & 100.1 & 6.23 d (_J_ 2.2 Hz) & 171.7, 162.8 & 116.0, 87.3 \\\\\n6 & 162.8 & & & \\\\\n1’ & 116.0 & & & \\\\\n2’ & 147.6 & & & \\\\\n3’ and 5’ & 116.4, 111.2 & 6.70 m & 147.6, 132.3, 129.2 & 116.0 \\\\\n4’ and 6’ & 132.3, 129.2 & 7.33 m & & 162.8, 147.6 \\\\\n4-OCHi & 55.9 & 3.85 s & & 171.7 \\\\\n2’-/NCH3 & 30.4 & 2.87 s & & 147.6 \\\\\n2’-/NH & - & 5.36 br s & & \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: NMR spectral data (CDCl_γ_, 9.8 T) of substance **1** isolated from _Almeida rubra_\n\nFigure 1: Compounds isolated from _Almeida rubra_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nchanges. The analyses of the crystal packing show the presence of four intermolecular interactions of the type C-H...O that give rise to the formation of chains along the (101) direction. These chains are connected with the chain just above and below it through three intermolecular interactions of the N-H...O type.\n\nThe quinoline and acridine alkaloids, which are widely distributed in Rutaceae, arise from combination of anthranilic acid and acetate/malonate.10 In these cases, the ciclization takes place by nucleophilic attack of nitrogen atom to the carboxyl carbon. However, compound **1** should be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom to the carboxyl carbon, giving rise an _a_-pyrone.\n\nWe have previously reported the isolation of the new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid **2b** (Figure 1) from _A. coerulea.2_ Reinvestigation of _A. rubra_ afforded an alkaloid **2a** whose spectral data seem to be very similar to those of **2b**. This alkaloid was isolated as a white powder and identified by NMR and LRMS. The molecular formula C20H25NO6 of **2a** was defined by elemental analysis.\n\nIn the 1H NMR spectrum of **2a** were observed a pair of doublets (_J_ 2.6 Hz) at \\(d\\) 7.58 and 6.97, and a singlet at \\(d\\) 4.30, which indicate that **2a** was a tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid. The signals at \\(d\\) 2.78, 2.20, and 2.01, assigned to H-5, and H-6, respectively, confirmed that **2a** had a reduced fluoroquinoline ring.\n\n1H NMR spectrum of **2a** also showed two singlets at \\(d\\) 3.14, and 2.03, and a group of signals at \\(d\\) 6.06 (d, \\(J\\) 16.1 Hz), 5.69 (d, \\(J\\) 16.1 Hz), 1.34 (s), and 1.31 (s), which indicated the presence of the 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent. Through the spectral data comparison, it was established that **2a** distinguished from **2b** by the presence of 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent instead of \\(g\\),_g_-dimethylallyl moiety.\n\nAnalysis of HSQC correlations and literature data2 allowed us to attribute undoubtedly chemical shifts to methyl, methylene, vinyl, furanyl hydrogen/carbon of **2a** (Table 2).\n\nThe assignments of quaternary carbons of **2a** were made from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-4 was deduced from 3\\(J\\) correlation between methoxyl hydrogens at C-4 (_d_ 4.30) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 158.2. The correlation of the other methoxyl hydrogens (_d_ 3.14) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 79.7 determined\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Carbon & \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) & HSQC & HMBC \\\\\n4 & 162.7 & & & \\\\\n3 & 105.2 & & & \\\\\n4 & 158.2 & & & \\\\\n4a & 117.6 & & & \\\\\n5 & 19.5 & 2.78 m & 117.6, 23.5 & 158.2, 150.0, 72.6 \\\\\n6 & 23.5 & 2.20, 2.01 m & 72.6, 19.5 & 117.6, 79.7 \\\\\n7 & 72.6 & 5.43 dd (_J_ 8.5, 2\n\n## Page 4\n\nC-8. C-4a was assigned through correlation between the carbon at d 117.6 and H-5, and H-6 (d 2.78, and 2.01). H-5 also correlated to C-8a (d 150.0). Furthermore, methyl hydrogens at d 1.34, and 1.31, correlated with an oxygenated carbon at d 70.8, establishing C-3\". Finally, the correlation between furanyl hydrogens (d 7.58, and 6.97) and quaternary carbons at d 162.7, and 105.2 determined C-2, and C-3, respectively.\n\nThe close similarity between the chemical shifts observed for carbons of reduced fluoroquinoline ring when compared with the model compound 7-_O_-acetylha-plophyllidine (**2b**)2 led us to suggest a _trans_ relationship between the 7-acetoxy and 8-methoxy groups. Alkaloid **2a**, _rel_-(7\\(R\\),8_R_)-8-[(_E_)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro [2,3-_b_]quinoline-7-yl acetate, is described for the first time in the literature, and the occurrence of tetrahydrouroquinoline alkaloid such as **2a** and **2b** seems to be restricted to the genera _Almeidea_ and _Haplophyllum_ of Rutaceae family.2,11\n\nIn order to improve the therapy of Chagas disease, we have been studying species of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, Burseraceae, and Cheoraceae) aiming to isolate hit compounds that could be used in the development of new antichagasic drugs.\n\nCompounds described in this paper were isolated from an active fraction of _A. rubra_ (62.9% lysis - percent reduction of the parasite number) on the tripomastigote forms of _T. cruzi_.12 Their _in vitro_ trypanocidal actions are shown on Table 3. Three of them (**7**-**9**) could not be assayed due to their instability.\n\nThe results showed that all of compounds had moderate trypanocidal actions and kokusagine (**6**) was the most active one. Probably, they are responsible by the activity of the _A. rubra_ fraction.12 However, they could not be considered good prototype for the development of new antichagasic drugs, mainly when their activities are compared with crystal violet and some lignans also isolated from other Rutaceae.13\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nThe 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using either Bruker DRX-200 and ARX-400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard.\n\nLow resolution EIMS were recorded on GC-17A, GCMS-QP5000 Shimadzu.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe leaves of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. were collected in May 2000 in Espirito Santo State, southeast of Brazil. The plant material was identified by Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani _et al_. 4746) was deposited at the Herbarium of that Department.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nDried leaves (313.5 g) were extracted first with hexane and then with MeOH at room temp. Part of the methanol extract (15.9 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield the corresponding fractions (ALFMH, ALFMD, ALFMA, ALFMM). The fraction ALFMA (3.3208 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 410 x 43 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give eleven fractions.\n\nThe second fraction (ALFMA2; 0.6302 g) was chromatographed on silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 358 x 31 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:AcOEt 8:2-MeOH) to afford ten fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) from the fraction five (ALFMA2,5; 103.6 mg) was obtained four fractions. Then, the second fraction (ALFMA2,5,2; 68.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient) to give four fractions. The third fraction (ALFMA2,5,2,3; 36.0 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (1:1) to afford six fractions. Through column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient) of the fraction five (ALFMA2,5,2,3,5; 14.3 mg) was isolated the alkaloid **2a** (2.6 mg).\n\nFraction four (ALFMA4; 178.1 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound & Concentration (μg/mL) & x Lysis \\% & IC50 \\\\\n500 & 250 & 100 & (mmol/L) \\\\\n**1** & 74.10 & 45.08 & 27.23 & 1.271 \\\\\n**2a** & 58.93 & 44.20 & 28.12 & 0.977 \\\\\n**3** & 57.99 & 42.39 & 24.00 & 1.231 \\\\\n**4** & 45.60 & 43.20 & 31.20 & 2.600 \\\\\n**5** & 65.17 & 30.35 & 25.44 & 1.455 \\\\\n**6** & 58.38 & 57.13 & 46.58 & 0.5596 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Trypanocidal activity of compounds isolated from _Almeidea rubra_\n\n## Page 5\n\nand eluted with MeOH to afford five fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) of the third fraction (ALFMA4,3; 59.9 mg) was obtained the alkaloid **5** (ALFMA4,3,7; 2.5 mg) and eight fractions. Then, the fourth fraction (ALFMA4,3,4; 2.3 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (332 x 25 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) to give three fractions. Further purification of the fraction two (ALFMA4,3,4,2; 2.0 mg) on preparative planar silica plate with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) afforded alkaloid **6** (1.6 mg). Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH) of the fraction five (ALFMA4,3,5; 21.5 mg) was isolated the compound **1** (14.7 mg).\n\nThe alkaloids arborinine (**3**) (43.2 mg), isodotudaprine (**7**) (25.6 mg), and isoskimminanine (**8**) (28.8 mg) were crystallized in MeOH from fraction six (ALFMA6; 104.5 mg), seven (ALFMA7; 317.3 mg) and nine (ALFMA9; 120.5 mg), respectively.\n\nThe other alkaloid isokokusagine (**9**) (32.1 mg) was purified on sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH) from fraction eight (ALFMA8; 90.3 mg), and the alkaloid **4** (3.2 mg) was obtained from fraction three (148.8 mg).\n\n#### 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one (1)\n\nYellow powder; elemental analysis (Found: C, 68.0432; H, 5.565904; N, 6.11885.

Data were collected up to 50deg in 2_th_, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;14 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.15 No absorption corrections were applied.\n\nThe structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.16 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.17 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. The programs SHELXL-97,17 and ORTEP-318 were used within WinGX19 to prepare materials for publication.

The infected blood was diluted with healthy mice blood to achieve a concentration of 2.106 forms/mL. Solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The activities of substances were evaluated at 500, 250, and 100 _m_g/mL.\n\nThe bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) which contained 400 _m_L mixture/well. The plates were incubated at 4 degC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h, following the method described by Brener.20\n\nInfected blood with the same volume of DMSO was used as control, and gentian violet to a concentration of 250 _m_g/mL was used as positive control.\n\nThe activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 values were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to FAPESP and CNPq for the \n\n## Page 6\n\nfinancial support and to Dr Jose Rubens Pirani for collecting and identifying the _Almeidea rubra_ specimen.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Jay, M.; Gleye, J.; Bouillant, M.L.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Phytochemistry_**1979**, _18_, 184 ; Moulis, C.; Wirasutisna, K.R.; Gleye, J.; Loiseau, P.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Pytochemistry_**1983**, _22_, 2095; Wirasutisna, K.R.; Gleye, J.; Moulis, C.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Pytochemistry_**1986**, _25_, 558.\n* [2] Santos, C.S.; Januario, A.H.; Vieira, P.C.; Fernandes, J.B.; Da Silva, M.F.G.F.; Pirani, J.R.; _J.

These sub-extracts were tested against _Cladosporium sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ using direct bioautography showing that only the ethyl acetate fraction was active. This sub-extract was bioassay-guide fractioned to afford a new phenolic derivative **1** along with several known compounds.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a brown amorphous powder. The molecular formula was determined as being C29H38O17 from the HRESIMS at _m/z_ 657.2065 [M-H]-. The UV spectrum showed an absorption maximum at 279 nm, which is compatible with a phenolic structure. The IR spectrum showed a characteristic absorption band attributable to the following groups: carbonyl (1708 cm-1), hydroxyl (3418 cm-1), and aromatic (1605 and 1509 cm-1), as well as a glycosidic linkage (1063 cm-1). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) revealed signals for two 1,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted symmetrical aromatic rings. The 1H NMR exhibited singlet signals corresponding to five aromatic methoxyls at dH 3.77 (6H, OCH3-3,5), 3.68 (3H, OCH3-4), and 3.87 (6H, OCH3-3'',5'') and two sets of aromatic proton signals at dH 6.41 (2H, H-2,6) and 7.34 (2H, H-2'',6'') due to a 3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl derivative and symmetrical 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-benzoyl moieties, respectively.9 This was supported by the gHMBC spectrum, which showed cross-peaks corresponding to a long-range coupling of hydrogen at dH 6.41 and carbon signals at dC 155.9 (C-1), 154.7 (C-3,5), 134.7 (C-4) and 96.5 (C-2,6) and also between hydrogen at dH 7.34 and carbon signals at dC 167.9 (C=O), 149.1 (C-3'',5''), 143.1 (C-4''), 120.6 (C-1'') and 108.5 (C-2'',6''). Others signals observed in 1H and 13C NMR spectra are consistent with glycosyl moieties. According to literature,10 the comparison of the 13C NMR data of the glycosidic moiety of various other analogous compounds, the structure of **1** seems to be composed of a glucosyl [dC 103.2 (C-1'), 74.9 (C-2'), 77.9 (C-3'), 71.5 (C-4'), 76.9 (C-5') and 68.2 (C-6')] and an apiosyl [dC 110.4 (C-1''), 78.7 (C-2''), 79.0 (C-3''), 75.0 (C-4'') and 67.9 (C-6'')] moieties. The 1H, 13C NMR and TOCSY spectra confirmed the presence of these two sugar moieties due to the presence of two anomeric signals at dH 4.79 (d, \\(J\\) 7.5 Hz)/dC 103.2 (CH) for glucose and dH 5.01 (d, \\(J\\) 2.3 Hz)/dC 110.4 (CH) for apiose. Furthermore, the coupling constants \\(J\\) 7.5 Hz of the anomeric proton signal of the d-glucosyl moiety as well as the chemical shift (dC 110.4) of the anomeric carbon of the d-apiosyl moiety, demonstrated that both sugar moieties have b-anomeric configurations. The _g_HMBC spectrum of **1** revealed cross-peaks corresponding to long-range couplings of hydrogens H-6' of b-glucose at dH 3.63 (d, \\(J\\) 10.0 Hz) and 4.06 (d, \\(J\\) 10.0 Hz) and carbon C-1'' of apiose at dC 110.4; in this way, the b-d-apiosyl moiety was attached to C-6' of the glucose. The chemical shift of the oxymethylene carbon C-6' (dC 68.2) was used to confirm the disaccharide linkage as apiofuranosyl-(1 ~6)-glucopyranoside.10 In addition, long-range correlations between H-5'' signals of b-d-apiose [dH 4.31 (d, \\(J\\) 11.4 Hz) and 4.39 (d, \\(J\\) 11.4 Hz)] and the syringoyl carbonyl group (dC 167.9) indicated that the 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-benzoyl group was attached to C-5'' of the b-d-apiose. Finally, the proton at dH 4.79 (H-1' of glucose) was correlated with C-1 of the 3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl group (dC 155.9), indicating that the b-d-glucosyl moiety was located at C-1. Therefore, the structure of compound **1** was established as being 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-b-d-(5-_O_-syngoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1 ~6)-b-d-glucopyranoside.\n\nThe known compounds **2-10** were identified by comparing their 1H and 13C NMR data with those previously published in literature.11-16\n\nThe antifungal activity of compounds **1**, **2**, **6-10** against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ was evaluated by direct bioautography on a TLC plate.17,18 Only compound **1** exhibited moderate activity (MIC of 100 mg), when compared with the standard nystatin (1.0 mg).\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\n1D- (1H, 13C, TOCSY) and 2D- (gHMQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 126 MHz (13C), using adequate solvent with TMS as internal standard. Accurate-mass measurements were performed on a quadrupole-time of flight instrument (UltrOTOF-Q, Bruker Daltonics). IR spectrum was obtained on a Nicolet-730 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr discs. UV absorption was measured on a Varian ProStar 330 diode array spectrophotometer. Optical rotation was measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena. Preparative HPLC was carried\n\nFigure 1: Phenolic glycoside isolated from _Alibertia sessilis_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nout in a Varian HPLC, using a Phenomenex Luna RP18 (2) column (\\(250\\times 21.20\\) mm i.d. \\(\\times\\) 10 \\(\\mu\\)m).\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Alibertia \\(sessilis\\)_ was collected in the Estacao Ecologica e Experimental de Mogi-Guacu (Ecological and Experimental Reserve of Mogi-Guacu), Sao Paulo, Brazil in November 2003 by Dr M.C.M. Young and identified by Dr I. Cordeiro. The voucher specimen (SP 370.914) was deposited at the Botanical Institute Herbarium, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nThe dried and powdered stems (50.0 g) of _A. sessilis_ were extracted exhaustively with ethanol, at room temperature, to give a crude material (4.15 g), which was partitioned in hexane, EtOAc and _n_-BuOH. After evaporation, the EtOAc extract (1.30 g) was submitted to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH as eluent to give 15 fractions after TLC analysis. Fraction 1 (116.2 mg) was composed of a precipitate, which was recrystallized with H2O to give d-manitol (**10**) (63.7 mg). Fraction 2 (146.4 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-18 using a gradient mixture of H2O/MeOH and MeOH/EtOAc as eluent to give 11 subfractions. Subfraction 2.1 (80.0 mg) was rechromatographed on RP-18, eluted with H2O with increasing amounts of MeOH to afford geniposidic acid (**2**) (11.8 mg). Subfraction 2.7 (29.6 mg) was also submitted to column chromatography on RP-18, using a gradient solvent system of H2O/MeOH and MeOH/EtOAc as eluent to yield 7 subfractions after TLC analysis. Subfraction 2.7.6 (18.8 mg) was chromatographed by preparative HPLC (C18 column; mobile phase: MeOH/H2O (3:7 v/v); flow rate: 10 mL min-1; UV detector: 238 nm) to separate the mixture of the diastereoisomeric lignans (+)-ly-lovingesinol 3a-O-b-d-glucopyranoside (**6**) (6.5 mg) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3a-O-b-d-glucopyranoside (**7**) (5.8 mg).19 Subtraction 2.7.7 (6.7 mg) was identified as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-b-d-(5-O-syringoyl)-apifuranosyl-(1-d)-b-d-glucopyranoside (**1**). Fraction 4 (274.2 mg) was fractioned on RP-18 using H2O with increasing amounts of MeOH as mobile phase to give salicylic acid (**9**) (6.4 mg). Fractions 5 and 6 (104.9 mg) were combined and submitted to column chromatography on silica gel eluting with hexane/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH to give 6.9 mg of chlorogenic acid (**8**).\n\nThe _n_-butanol extract (0.55 g) was submitted to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH as eluent to give 7 fractions after TLC analysis. Fraction 3 (180.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-18 using a gradient mixture of H2O/MeOH to give 9 subfractions. Subfraction 3.4 (10.2 mg) was identified as \n\n## Page 4\n\nan iridoid mixture **3-5** and subfraction 3.6 (8.6 mg) as a lignan mixture **6-7**.\n\n#### 3, 4, 5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-b-d-(5-O-syringoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1-d6)-b-d-glucopyranoside (I)\n\nBrown amorphous powder (6.7 mg, 0.16%).

For the antifungal assay, solutions containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 mg of the test compound were prepared. 10.0 mL of each solution was applied to pre-coated TLC plates eluted with EtOAc/MeOH (7:3 v/v) and dried to completely remove all solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of _Cladosporium sphaerospermum_ or _C. cladosporioides_ in glucose and salt solution and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 degC. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of the compound required to eliminate the fungus (detection limits - minimum amount required for the inhibition of fungal growth on TLC plates). Nystatin was used as the positive control (1 mg).17,18\n\n## Conclusions\n\nLignans **6** and **7** are here described for the first time as being found in Rubiaceae and the antifungal phenolic glucoside **1** is being reported for the first time in literature. Compound **10** was previously isolated from _Alibertia mycrifolia_. Phenolics **8** and **9** are here reported for the first time as being found in genus _Alibertia_. Iridoids **2** and **3-5** are in agreement with chemosystematic correlations and botanical occurrence in the Rubiaceae family. This study will contribute significantly to improve knowledge about secondary metabolites and biological activity for one more species from the Brazilian Cerrado.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) for financial support and also to the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) for a fellowship granted to V.C.S.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Bolzani, V. da S.; Young, M.

This new compound was characterized by spectral data as 11-O-_trans_-feruloylteucerin.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSeveral tropical Brazilian Rubiaceae species from the rain forests and _cerrado_, produce phytoalexins in response to fungal inoculation [1]. Among the 15 assayed species, plants of the _Tocoyena formosa_ collected in Mogi-Guacu, in the state of Sao Paulo, showed positive phytoalexin response during the entire year except during winter [2], A positive response is not necessarily associated with the appearance of phytoalexins, but could be caused by inhibitns. After TLC bioassays the extracts obtained from the leaves and stems of this species revealed several different fungitoxic zones. Recently we reported the isolation and structural determination of four iridoids from the leaves of _T. formosa_. Two of them, _a_- and _b_- gardiol, showed inhibitory activity against fungal growth [3]. We now describe the isolation and characterization of four iridoids, 3-6, from the stems of _T. Formosa_, with antifungal properties, as well as the inactive, known compounds 1-2. The new iridoid 6 and the known iridoids 3-5 showed activity against the growth of _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ (Fres.) de Vries (Demiaaceae). This is a common phylolcladane fungus and a contaminant of many species of seeds [4]. Some strains of _C. cladosporioides_ appear to be weakly pathogenic [5]. In this paper we report the isolation and structural elucidation of this new iridoid.\n\n## Experimental\n\nIR spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Model 1600 spectrometer, 1H-NMR (200 and 400 MHz) and 13C-NMR (50 and 100.57 Mhz) spectra on a Brucker and a Varian Unity 400, respectively, at 25deg; EI-MS and HRMS: MS Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Virginia, USA.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n### Plant material\n\nStems of _Tocoyena formosa_ were collected from preserved areas of a Brazilian _cerrado_ in the biological reserve of the Mogi-Guacu Ecological and Experimental Station, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen (# SP 178799) was deposited in the Maria Eneida Fidalgo Herbarium of the Instituto de Botanica de Sao Paulo.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of the constituents\n\nDried and powdered stems (2.0 kg) of _T. formosa_ were successively extracted in soxhlet with hexane and EtOH. The hexane extract (310 mg) was fractioned by silica gel column chromatography (6.0 g) yielding sitosterol (10 mg), b-amirin (30 mg), and fatty material. The crude ethanolic extract (200 g) was solubilized in EtOH:H2O (8:2) and partitioned into hexane (30 g), CHCl3 (22 g) and n-BuOH (45.5 g). The n-BuOH soluble fraction (250 mg) was submitted to CC on silica gel (10 g) and eluted with CH2Cl2 with increasing amounts of MeOH. After TLC, some fractions were combined and submitted to prep. TLC developed with CH2Cl2:AcOEt (4:2) and CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (68:38:10) gave 1 (13.5 mg), **2** (14.0 mg), **3** (6.2 mg, colorless gum **4** (10.5 mg, mp 113-115deg, [lit. 110-115deg]), **5** (15.0 mg, colorless gum) and **6** (20.1 mg, colorless gum).\n\n### Bioassay\n\nFungitoxic zones were detected using a spore suspension of _C. cladosporioides_12 on TLC silica gel plates developed with CHCl3:MeOH (7:3) and CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (68:38:10).\n\n11-O-_trans_fenuloylteucren **6**.

The other five compounds1**-5**, are known compounds and were identified as the triterpene saponin (3-O-b-D-glu-copranosyl-28-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl quinovic acid) 16, the flavonol glycoside (quercetin-3-O-b-D-methyl-3-rhamnopyranoside) 27, and the iridoids galioside **38**, 9, galioside aglicone **4**, and apodanthoside **5**10, 11.\n\nThe iridoid **6** showed structural features very related with teucrein, which was isolated as an acetyl derivative from _Teucrium marum_ (Labiateae)13. The molecular formula of **6** was determined as C19H22O6 from its HRMS (m/z 346.1305; calc. 346.1314). The EI-mass fragments at m/z 163 [C6H2O3]+, 135 [C8H2O2]+ and 109 [C6H5O2]+ indicated the presence of a feurolyl unity in the side chain of **6**. The IR spectrum showed diagnostic absorption bands occurring at 3294 (vOH), 1680 (vC = O a,b-unsaturated ester), 1630 (vC = C), and 1605 and 1438 cm-1 (vC = C, aromatic unity). The presence of a _trans_-feruloyl moiety was confirmed by 1H- and 13C-NMR resonance spectral data (Table 1). Analysis of the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data of **6**, including DEPT 135 and HETCOR experiments also indicated that this compound bears an iridoidal skeleton, which was identified as teucrein **7**, by comparison of \n\n## Page 4\n\nthe \\({}^{1}\\)H- and \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR chemical shifts with those reported in the literature\\({}^{13}\\). In the \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectrum of 6 relative to 7, H-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 5.00) was shielded by 0.87 ppm, while in the \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR spectrum C-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 90.1) it was shielded by 1.4 ppm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectrum also showed resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 4.70 d and 4.66 d (\\(\\delta\\) 66.9), attributable to hydroxymethylene H-11, in agreement with structure 7. This observation indicated that C-11 should be the site of esterification and that in C-1 the hydroxyl group should be free. An HMDEC \\({}^{1}\\)H- \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR (Fig. 1) correlation confirmed not only the substitution of _transfer_ly unity at C-11, but also confirmed that the hydroxyl group at C-1 is free. The structure of 6 was therefore established as the novel 11-O-_trans_-feruloylteucren.\n\nThe presence of aglicone iridoids with antifungal activity suggests that they can play a defensive role against fungal attack. However an additional study must be undertaken in order to prove whether these compounds are phytoalexins or inhibiting.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Braga, M.R.; Young, M.C.M.; Ponte, J.V.A.; Dietrich, S.M.C.; Emerenciano, V.P.; Gottlieb, O.R. _Biochem.
