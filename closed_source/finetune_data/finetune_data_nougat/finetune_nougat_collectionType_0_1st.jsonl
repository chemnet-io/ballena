The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artificial diet at 1 mg g\\({}^{-1}\\) and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superficial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g\\({}^{-1}\\). Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic _S. densiflora_ extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from _V. polygamma_ were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, flavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition.\n\n(c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry 2006 62 1072 1081 2006 1\n\nTaruma; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; _Vitex polygamma; Siphoneugena densiflora; Spodoptera frugiperda_; botanical insecticide; pest control\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nWith a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efficacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3\n\n_Spodoptera frugiperda_ JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Nocutuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important field crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by consuming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4\n\nOf the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, _Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5-9 This plant is commonly called 'Maria-Preta', 'Taruma', 'Congonha-cinco-folhas' and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, _Siphoneugena densiflora_ Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in Sao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named 'Uvatinga',13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nEven though the selected plant species have not been ordinarily employed in pest control, their families comprise several species with injurious properties to insects reported in the literature.15-21 The present paper specifically deals with the effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from _V, polygamma_ and _S. densiflora_ against fall armyworm (_S. frugiperda_). Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### General\n\nHeteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, \\(J\\) 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethaneol) from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck-Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei Munchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low-resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple-quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectrophotometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pellets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Australia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 x 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software.\n\nColumn chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70-230 or 230-400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), Sephadex(r) LH-20 (25-100 mm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7(r) (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled.\n\n### Plants\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ were collected in July 2000, in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil, respectively.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after filtration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 degC. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 x 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting filtrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 degC) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid-liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1.\n\nCompounds **1** to **43** were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (**1, 9, 14** to **18, 25, 26** and **43;** see Fig. 1) are described below. Some of them, like compounds **15** and **16**, were isolated from more than one different extract of the same plant.\n\n#### Isolation of compounds **13** to **19** from Siphoneugena densiflora (_SD-EMR layer_)\n\nA quantity of 9 g of SD-EMR (Table 1) was subjected to CC using silica gel (38.0 x 5.0 cm) with dichloromethane + ethyl acetate (7 + 3 by volume) as eluent and gradient elution.

The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a final concentration of 1 mg g-1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 x 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 degC), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One first-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 +- 1 degC, 70 +- 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single first-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot's formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 x 6.0 cm) containing filter paper at the bottom (4.0 x 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10-20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence.\n\nThe control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground.\n\nMethanoic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls.\n\n#### 2.5.2 Isolated compounds\n\nFour well plates (24 x 1.5 mL wells) were filled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar flow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 mL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artificial congealed diet. The final concentration was about 0.1 mg g-1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot's formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound.\n\n### _Statistical analysis_\n\nData consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment means were established by Tukey's test.24 Results are given in the text as probability values, with \\(P\\) < 0.05 adopted as the criterion of significance.

They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid-liquid partition.\n\nPartition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD-AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2).\n\nThe VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of _Vitex madiensis_ caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in _S. frugiperda_.30 Ecdysteroids **9** to **12** (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract.\n\nFlavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufficient amounts to be bioassayed. The flavonoids quercetin (**25**) and quercetin (**26**) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (**25**) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450-dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione _S_-transferases from _S. frugiperda_.35 In addition, quercetin (**26**), a flavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not significantly different (_P_ < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound **17**, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity.\n\n### _Developmental effects_\n\nIn general, no statistically significant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP-HL and VP-HF, which showed significantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage.\n\nCompound **9**, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statistically significant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (_P_ < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmental stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result.\n\nAlthough the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds **14** and **43** (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins **15** and **17** were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea-Bulla _et al._,38 gallic acid (**13**), the compound isolated from several extracts of _S. densiflora_ and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound **14**, significantly reduces larval growth of _S. frugiperda_ at 1 mg g-1.\n\n## 4 CONCLUSIONS\n\nPolar extracts from _S. densiflora_ and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efficient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of _S. frugiperda_. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin **14** along with the insecticidal effects of flavonoids **25** and **26** might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound **14** might be acting synergistically with **43**, and in concert with daucosterol (**19**), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid **13** and other\n\n## Page 9\n\ncompound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr Fatima R Salimena-Pires (Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora - UFJF) and Marcos Sobral (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG) for botanical identifications, and to ALCOA Alumimio S/A for facilitating plant collections.

The fungus led to the formation of a different product through an unusual epoxidation reaction between C4 and C5, formation of a C3,C10 ether bridge, and a methoxylation of the C1 of tagitin C. The chemical structure of the product, namely 1_b_-methoxy-3_a_-hydroxy-3,10_b_-4,5_a_-diepoxy-3_b_-isobutyroyloxygermac-11(13)-en-6\\(a\\),12-olide, is the same as that of a derivative that was recently isolated from the flowers of a Brazilian population of Mexican sunflower (_Tithonia diversifolia_), which is the source of the substrate tagitinin C. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the substrate and the biotransformed product were evaluated in HL-60 cells using an MTT assay, and both compounds were found to be cytotoxic. We show that soil fungi may be useful in the biotransformation of sesquiterpene lactones, thereby leading to unusual changes in their chemical structures that may preserve or alter their biological activities, and may also mimic plant biosynthetic pathways for production of secondary metabolites.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are a large group of natural products found mainly in plants of the family Asteraceae. They are considered chemical markers within the family and have ecological as well as economic value [10, 37]. Moreover, STLs exhibit an array of interesting biological activities such as antimicrobial [5], cytostatic [25], and antifeedant activities [30]. They are the main active constituents of many medicinal plants of Asteraceae worldwide [32].\n\nTagitinin C (**1**, Fig. 1) is an important STL occurring in the glandular trichomes of the leaves and inflorescences of Mexican sunflower (_Tithonia diversifolia_ Hemsl. A. Gray, Asteraceae) [2]. It shows cytotoxic [19], anti-inflammatory [33], and antifeedant activities [2], and thus is a promising compound for further research into its mechanisms of action in different targets. _T. diversifolia_, the source of **1**, is used in folk medicine in many countries [8, 14] and has\n\n## Page 2\n\nanti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties [8]. However, there remains concern regarding the ingestion of STLs because of their toxicity [35]. An interesting approach is to obtain STL derivatives that may have lower toxic effects or improved pharmacological activities, or both. Obtaining STL analogues, however, based on classic synthetic methods is not always a straightforward procedure, so the biotransformation of biologically active STLs is an attractive alternative providing new derivatives whose effects should be investigated [20].\n\nThe biotransformation of organic compounds by microorganisms is considered an economically and ecologically viable technology. In addition, it is a useful tool for the structural modification of bioactive natural products and the study of natural product metabolism [15, 16]. Moreover, some microorganisms can transform drugs in a similar way to mammals, and the utilization of microbial systems as models which mimic the metabolism of drugs in humans has received considerable attention [7, 16].\n\nFungal biotransformations of naturally occurring STLs have been carried out to obtain modifications that enhance activity and/or decrease toxicity [21, 24], develop structure-activity relationships [1, 4], and establish in vitro models to predict mammalian metabolites [3, 39]. A considerable number of biotransformations of STLs have been described using fungi [29]. _Aspergillus niger_ (ATCC 16888), for example, transformed costunolide into four main products, 1_b_-hydroxyarbusculin, colartin, 11,13-dihydrosantamarine, and 11,13-dihydroreynosin [20]. In the same study, _A. ochraceous_ (CECT 2069) transformed deoxyvulgarin into two products, vulgarin and dihydrodouglanin [20]. The microbial transformation of sclareolide by _A. niger_ (ATCC 10549) yielded four oxidized metabolites identified as 1_b_-hydroxystacleolide, 3_b_-hydroxystacleolide, 1\\(a\\),3_b_-dihydroxyscalreolide, and 1\\(b\\),3_b_-dihydroxysclareolide [31]. The STL artemisitene was metabolized by _A. niger_ (NRRL 599) to yield 11_-epi_-artemisinin, 9_b_-hydroxydeoxy-11_-epi_-artemisinin, and 9_b_-hydroxy-11_-epi_-artemisinin [27]. Microbial transformation of the germacranolide parthenolide using _A. niger_ (NRRL 599) and _A. ochraceous_ (NRRL 2295) yielded 11_b_-dihydroparthenolide [11]. _A. terreus_ (IFO6123) transformed dehydrocostuslactone into two derivatives, 11\\(a\\),13-dihydrodehydrocostuslactone and 16-(1-methyl-1-propenyl)eremanntholide [13]. Cultures of two strains of _A. niger_ (AS 3.1858 and VKM F-1119) transformed one of the most important STLs, artemisinin, into four hydroxylated products, 3_b_-hydrodeoxyartemisinin, 1_a_-hydroxyartemisinin, 5_b_-hydroxyartemisinin, and 7_b_-hydroxyartemisinin [28, 39]. According to the literature, the main enzymatic reactions of STLs that are able to be catalyzed by _Aspergillus\n\nFig. 1: Proposal of biotransformation of **1** into **2** by _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 (adapted from Spring et al. [38])\n\n## Page 3\n\nspecies are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation.\n\nThus, with the aims of obtaining new, potentially bioactive compounds, and giving insights into the new metabolic reactions of STLs, we carried out the biotransformation of tagitinin C (**1**, Fig. 1) by the fungus _Aspergillus terreus_ MT 5.3.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Isolation of tagitinin C (**1**)\n\nLeaves of _Tithonia diversifolia_ (400 g) were collected by B. A. Rocha, in May 2007, in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. The material was identified by F. B. Da Costa, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the SPFR Herbarium, Department of Biology, Ribeirao Preto, SP, University of Sao Paulo, under the number FBC #126. Air-dried entire leaves were rinsed for a few seconds with dichloromethane, for dissolution of the glandular trichomes [2], thereby yielding 5 g of a yellow crude extract after filtration with common filter paper and solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. The dry residue was re-suspended in MeOH/H2O (7:3, v/v) and extracted with _n_-hexane followed by dichloromethane. After solvent evaporation, the dichloromethane layer was fractionated over silica gel 60H (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7736) by vacuum liquid chromatography [9] using increasing amounts of ethyl acetate in _n_-hexane, thereby yielding nine fractions of 250 ml each. The tagitinin C-rich fractions (3 and 4) (1.5 g, confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, TLC, and reversed-phase HPLC analysis, as well as comparison with an authentic sample [2]) were purified by centrifugal chromatography (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7749; 4 mm thickness; _n_-hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 6:3:1 v/v as eluent; flow rate 2 ml/min; UV lamp 254 nm). For final purification, preparative TLC was used (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730; 1 mm thickness; _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate/chloroform 5:3:2 v/v, and 2 % acetic acid as eluent). The isolated compound (**1**, 200 mg) was analyzed by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to check its purity before the biotransformation procedure. The 1H NMR spectral data of compounds (**1** and **2**) were in accordance with those reported [2].\n\n### Biotransformation procedure and analysis\n\nScreening was performed on a small scale (30 ml of fermentation medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks) to select efficient conditions for the biotransformation of **1**. The trials for screening procedures were performed as previously described by Krishna-Kumari et al. [17]. _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 was cultivated in malt extract medium and incubated at 30 degC for 7 days to obtain spores. After that, the spores were harvested using a 2 % Tween 80 aqueous solution and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. The pre-fermentative medium was inoculated with 1 x 107 spores/ml and incubated with agitation (150 rpm) at 30 degC for 48 h. The resulting mycelium was harvested, rinsed with sterilized H2O, and transferred to fresh Czapek medium (initial pH 6.0). The culture was then incubated under the same conditions for 10 days. After 24 h, 0.1 mg/ml of **1**, which had been previously dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (3 mg dissolved in 300 ml), was added to the culture medium. Control flasks contained culture medium with the fungus but without **1**, culture medium with the fungus and dimethyl sulfoxide and without **1**, culture medium with **1** and without the fungus, or only the culture medium. A time course study was carried out as follows. One Erlenmeyer flask was taken every 24 h; the product was extracted with dichloromethane, and then analyzed by TLC to check the degree of transformation of compound **1**. TLC was carried out on silica gel GF254 (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730) plates (0.25 mm thickness, 20 x 20 cm), and the spots were visualized after spraying the plates with vanillin/sulfuric acid (1 % H2SO4 in ethanol).\n\nThirty milligrams of **1** was used for the preparative-scale incubation with _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 for 120 h, at 150 rpm, and 30 degC. The culture broth was filtered using filter paper and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting residue (45 mg) was subjected to separation by HPLC in a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp liquid chromatograph with an SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector (Japan) using a C-18 column (Shimadzu, Japan, ODS Shim-pack 5 mm, 4.6 x 250 mm; flow rate of 1 ml/min; DAD detection). The main metabolite (**2**, 4 mg) was purified after repeated injections according to the following gradient: 0.1 min 20 % MeCN, 35 min 60 % MeCN, 38 min 100 % MeCN, 43 min 100 % MeCN, 48 min 20 % MeCN, and 53 min 20 % MeCN. Compounds **1** and **2** were observed at retention times of 24 and 29 min, respectively (UV detection set at 210 nm). Comparison of the HPLC profiles of the controls with those bio-transformed ensured that **1** had been converted to **2** through microbial catalysis.\n\nThe structures of compounds **1** and **2** were determined by HR-ESIMS, 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques, and comparison of the spectroscopic data with an authentic sample and published data [2]. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker (Germany) DPX 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H). Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Aldrich (USA). High-resolution mass \n\n## Page 4\n\nspectra were recorded on a UltrOTOFq-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA).\n\n### Microorganism\n\n_Aspergillus terreus_ MT 5.3 was isolated from soil in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and identified by C. M. S. Motta from \"Colecao de Culturas-Microeca URM-Departamento de Nicologia/CCB-UFP\", Av. Prof. Nelson Chaves s/no., Cidade Universitaria, 50670-420, Recife, Brazil. The fungus was maintained by periodic transfers on PDA at 8 degC.\n\nThe microorganism _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 was deposited in the collection \"Colecao de Culturas Tropicais\" (Tropical Culture Collection) of Andre Tosello Foundation (www. fat.org.br), under accession number CCT-7640.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nHuman promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, as described by Mossman [23]. The MTT (Sigma, USA) solution at a final concentration of 500 mg/ml was added to the culture medium 4 h before the end of the treatment, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide to the cell culture. For cell treatment we used compounds **1** and **2**, at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 mg/ml. Non-treated culture cells were used as a negative control, and cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's \\(t\\) test; and Dunnett's test was used for multiple comparisons. A \\(p\\) value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results are expressed as the mean +- SEM.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe transformation of **1** by _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 yielded the unusual STL **2** as the main compound. This was identified as 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-3,10_b_-4,5_a_-diepoxy-8_b_-isobutyroyloxygermacr-11(13)-en-6\\(a\\),12-olide. The 1H NMR spectral data of **1** and **2** are shown in Table 1. Although several researchers worldwide have chemically investigated _T. diversifolia_, compound **2** was isolated only from a Brazilian population [2]. As already mentioned, it should be emphasized that the main enzymatic reactions that _Aspergillus_ promotes in STLs are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation [6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 39, 40]. Interestingly, we have uncovered an unusual epoxidation between C4 and C5; a methoxy group was added at C1, and a C1,C10 ether bridge was formed in the 10-membered ring of **1**. Nevertheless, the exocyclic double bond at C11-C13 was preserved. Compound **2** was recently isolated from a rinse extract of the inflorescences of Brazilian _T. diversifolia_ [2]. Although its chemical structure is already known, this is the first time that **2** has been obtained as a microbial biotransformation product. An interesting observation is that the _Aspergillus_ strain used in our work was able to catalyze chemical reactions that mimicked those which occur inside the glandular trichomes from the inflorescences of _T. diversifolia_. Glandular trichomes of Asteraceae species are the places where the biosynthesis of STLs usually occurs, and possibly where **1** is converted to **2**. Thus, this fungus can be used as an alternative means of gaining **2** from **1**, therefore confirming the potential of biotransformation of natural compounds by microorganisms, as well as their ability to mimic plant biosynthetic pathways [34].\n\nSpring et al. [38] reported the isolation of a closely related analogue of **1** from _Viguiera quinqueremis_ (Asteraceae), and proposed its conversion to the hemiketal form, such as **1b** depicted in Fig. 1. The structural differences between the previously reported analogue and **1** are the nature of the C8 side-chain ester (methylbutyrate instead of isobutyrate) and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C15. The authors also discussed a spontaneous methoxylation of the **1a** analogue at C1 in the presence of MeOH, thereby leading to the formation of an analogue of **1b** (Fig. 1) [38]. Thus, it could be argued in our work that **2** is a compound produced by _A. terreus_ starting from **1b**, an artifact that had\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} H & **1** & **2** \\\\\n1 & 6.93 d (16.9) & 3.99 dd (6.7, 10.4) \\\\\n2a & 6.26 d (16.9) & 2.57 dd (6.7, 12.5) \\\\\n2b & – & 1.93 dd (10.7, 12.6) \\\\\n5 & 5.88 d (9.0) & 3.33 s \\\\\n6 & 5.41 d (9.0) & 5.13 dd (4.65) \\\\\n7 & 3.55 m & 4.33 dddd \\\\\n8 & 5.33 ddd (3.2, 6.0, 10.0) & 5.53 dd (4.2; 7.1, 11.0) \\\\\n9a & 2.40 dd (6.0, 13.8) & 1.74 dd (11.1, 14.7) \\\\\n9b & 2.00 dd (10.0, 13.8) & 1.66 dd (4.8, 14.7) \\\\\n13a & 6.36 d (1.7) & 6.29 dd (2.8) \\\\\n13b & 5.81 d (1.8) & 5.62 dd (2.3) \\\\\n14 & 1.53 s & 1.50 s \\\\\n15 & 1.95 s & 1.44 s \\\\\n2′ & 2.44 sept & 2.41 sept \\\\\n3′ & 1.06 d (7.1) & 1.05 d (7.0) \\\\\n4′ & 1.03 d (7.1) & 1.04 d (7.0) \\\\ \\textasciitilde{}OMe & – & 3.35 s \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: 1H NMR spectral data of compounds **1** and **2** (500 MHz, CDCl3, \\(J\\) in Hz)\n\n## Page 5\n\noriginated from **1** in the presence of MeOH. Nevertheless, a spontaneous interconversion where **1** was converted to **1b** would never occur in methods such as ours, because MeOH was not used in any step of the experimental procedure, either for isolation, analysis, or structure elucidation of **1**. Compound **2** is therefore a natural product obtained by biotransformation of **1**. In addition, the crude extract from the leaves of _T. diversifolia_ used in this work had been screened for the presence of **2** by HPLC-DAD analysis, and it was not detected even as a trace.\n\nAccording to Barrero et al. [6], epoxidation and hydrogenation reactions of the exocyclic double bond at C11-C13 seem to be the most common processes in the microbial transformation of STLs by filamentous fungi. In order to explain the formation of the epoxide group between C4 and C5 in the biotransformed molecule **2** as well as the methoxylation of C1, we followed the proposal of Onken and Berger [26]. The authors state that terpenoids are preferentially dissolved in the cell membranes of fungi, thereby inducing changes in properties of the membrane and causing toxicity. Fungi react against these effects and co-metabolize compounds to others that are more water soluble, thus showing that the enzyme systems involved in this process of detoxification are comparable to those of other eukaryotic cells. In the first step, monooxygenases of cytochrome P450 catalyze the oxyfunctionalization of the molecules [12, 22]. Then, in the second step, more water-soluble products are formed by the action of hydrolases or conjugation by glutathione S-transferases [6, 12]. Thus, the biotransformation of **1** leading to **2** might be part of a detoxification process created by the fungus.\n\nThe cytotoxicity bioassay was designed to observe whether **1** and **2** could elicit cell death at the selected concentrations. Both compounds showed cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells lines comparable to that of the positive control, which was statistically significant when compared with the negative control (_p_ < 0.05). The results indicated that **1** and **2** have cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells at the lowest tested doses. Similar results were found while using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where **1** and **2** also presented cytotoxic effects, thus indicating non-selective toxicity. It has previously been shown that **1** has cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells [19], but its activity has not yet been compared with that of the derivative **2**. In the same work, compound **1b** was isolated from _T. diversifolia_ as a natural compound and was found to be approximately 10 times more active than **1**. In our work, compound **2**, a C4-C5 epoxy derivative of **1b**, had a statistically similar activity to **1**.\n\nKupchan et al. [18] demonstrated that the in vitro cytotoxicity of STLs against human carcinoma was dependent on the presence of the a-methylene-g-lactone moiety. Moreover, evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of further derivatives indicated which functional groups contributed to the activity. So-called active functional groups have therefore been proposed for several STLs. It has been verified, for example, that an extra a,b-unsaturated moiety contributed to enhancing the activity of STLs with the a-methylene-g-lactone group, whereas the compounds containing only this additional unsaturation did not present significant activity [18]. In another study, it was confirmed that among other structural and electronic factors, the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl structure elements (cyclopentenone and a-methylene-g-lactone) are correlated with cytotoxicity [36]. In our work, compound **1**, containing three a,b-unsaturated moieties, had statistically similar activity to **2**, with only one a,b-unsaturated moiety. This suggested therefore that its extra unsaturations were not important to the effect observed in HL-60 cells.\n\nIn summary, we have observed that in the presence of compound **1**, enzymes from _A. terreus_ MT 5.3 were able to generate **2** in the same way as the enzymes located in the glandular trichomes of _T. diversifolia_. This fungus can thus be used as an alternative source of **2** because it mimics plant biosynthetic processes. The absence of two a,b-unsaturations in **2** did not improve or decrease its cytotoxic activity in the HL-60 cells when compared with **1**. Finally, we suggest that the mammalian metabolism of **1** after oral consumption of preparations containing _T. diversifolia_ leaves should be researched in future, because this STL may form toxic compounds when metabolized.\n\n## References\n\n- Aleu J, Hanson JR, Galan RH, Collado IG (1999) Biotransformation of the fungistatic sesquiterpenoid patchoulol by _Botrytis cinerea_.

The genus _Styrax_ is different from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammatory diseases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styracaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985; Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988; Anil, 1980; Segal et al., 1967, 1964; Ulubelen et al., 1978; Kawai and Sugimoto, 1940; Kitagawa et al., 1974; Ulubelen, 1976; Nakano et al., 1967).\n\nFrom the leaves of _Styrax ferrugineus_ Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**4**) and the known _nor_-lignans 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**1**), 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**2**), 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**3**) and the lignan dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (**5**), together with ursoclinic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds **1-2** showed inhibitory properties against the microorganisms, _Candida albicans, Cladosporium cladesoporiades_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_, whereas compounds **3-5** inhibited only _S. aureus_ and _C. albicans_. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elucidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and 2).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves of _Styrax ferrugineus_ were extracted with a mixture of CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)--CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH (2:1 v/v). Evaporation gave an extract, which showed\n\n## Page 2\n\nantimicrobial activity, detected by inhibition of _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ (Table 3). The bioactive extract was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with _n_-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOHAc (4x300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by purification on preparative HPLC afforded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (**4**) and the known _nor_-lignans (**1**) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (**2**) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and (**3**) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (**5**) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identified by chromatographic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The triterpenes and sterols were identified by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13C NMR spectral data for 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-methylene-dioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**1**) and 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**2**). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13C NMR spectral data for **1** and **2** are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC correlations are presented in Fig. 1.\n\nCompound **2** was obtained earlier from the seeds of _S. officinalis_ (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent purification of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of _S. camporum_ (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucidation of compound (**4**) as well as the antimicrobial activities of all lignoids isolated.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The molecular formula C26H32O10 was deduced from ES-MS _m_/_z_ [M + Na]+ 527, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. Its IR spectrum recorded hydroxyl (3550-3200 cm 1), unsaturated (1650 cm 1) and aromatic (1550, 870 cm 1) absorptions, and its UV absorbance\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline Carbon & **1a** & **2b** & **4c** \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 156.06 \\(s\\) & 156.35 \\(s\\) & 156.12 \\(s\\) \\\\\n3 & 100.32 \\(d\\) & 100.27 \\(d\\) & 101.12 \\(d\\) \\\\\n4 & 112.28 \\(d\\) & 112.28 \\(d\\) & 112.12 \\(d\\) \\\\\n5 & 137.50 \\(s\\) & 137.49 \\(s\\) & 137.85 \\(s\\) \\\\\n6 & 1\n\n## Page 3\n\n(MeOH) was at 312.0 and 216.5 nm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Tables 1 and 2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of **4** with those described for **2** indicated that **4** is a glucoside derivative of compound **2**. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum of **4** displayed four doublets at \\(\\delta\\) 6.77 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 7.44 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 1.9; 8.0 Hz) attributable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 7.17 (1H, _s_) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, _s_), two triplets due to methylene protons at \\(\\delta\\) 2.75 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at \\(\\delta\\) 1.86 (2H, _dt_, \\(J\\) = 7.8 Hz). This \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of compound **2**. Further analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 4.11 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) and several signals at \\(\\delta\\) 4.33-3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound **4**. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **4** (Table 2) suggested the presence of a _nor_-ligman with similar skeleton to **2**. The main difference observed in the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **4** was due to the presence of the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH\\({}_{2}\\)) which confirmed a glucosyl moiety. The \\({}^{1}\\)H--\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C-three-bond (HMBC) correlations from the H-\\({}^{1\\prime\\prime}\\) protons resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 107.64 and 112.12 identified the later as C-4. The \\({}^{3}\\)_J_ HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and C-4\\({}^{\\prime}\\) quaternary carbons with H-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\) proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-tri-substituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound **4**. Other significant correlations for confirmation of **4** are depicted in Fig. 1.\n\nThe extract and compounds isolated from _S. ferrugineus_ were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_, respectively. Compounds **1-2** exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_, whereas compounds **3-5** inhibited only _S. aureus_ and _C. albicans_. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ could be predictive for the activity against _C. albicans_. In conclusion, the activities of compounds **1-5** may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infections in several Brazilian regions.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and 50 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and 100 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\), respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70-230 and 230-400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F\\({}_{254}\\) plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) after heating.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Styrax ferrugineus_ Ness et Mart.

Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Bioassay\n\nThe crude extract and purified lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium _S. aureus_ ATCC 12228, the fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast _C. albicans_ ICB 12. Stock solutions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure compounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appropriate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on pre-coated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as positive and negative controls, respectively. For the antifungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of _C. sphaerospermum_ in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 27degC. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with _C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of _C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30degC for 24 h.\n\n### Extraction\n\nDried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of _Styrax ferrugneus_ Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2-CH3OH (2:1, v/v) at room temperature. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH-H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOHAc. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respectively. The CHCl3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel flash (77.9 g, 230-400 mesh, Merck) using a CH2Cl2-CH3OH gradient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran **(1)**, and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran **(2)**. Fr. 40-41 (39.4 mg) was fractionated by micron silica gel flash CC (Merck) using CH2Cl2-CH3OH (95:5) as eluent to afford 11 Frs. Frs. 5-9 gave a mixture of unsolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52-55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica flash CC (11.6 g, 230-400 mesh, Merck) using Hex-EtoAc-CH3OH (6:2:2) as eluent to afford 20 Frs. Frs 6-12 furnished dihydrohedjcolorifyl alcohol **(5)** (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH2Cl2-CH3OH gradient yielded 22 Frs.

The compounds were separated by recycling-HPLC, and their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. CD measurements were used to establish the absolute configuration of the anthrone and oxanthrone. The antifungal activity of 1-_O_-b- and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ was shown to be similar to that of the lignan sesamin. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Further investigations afforded, in minor quantities, two new _C,O_-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picraminoside F (**1**), and an anthrone, mayoside C (**2**), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**3**) and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of compounds **1** and **2**, and the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe EtOAc extract from the bark of _P. taepensis_ afforded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds **1**-**4**, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shimadzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones **3** and **4** were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992).\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-molecular ions at \\(m/z\\) 671 ([M+1]\\({}^{+}\\)), 693 ([M+Na]\\({}^{+}\\)) and 709 ([M+K]\\({}^{+}\\)), with the base peak at \\(m/z\\) 509 ([M+1-C6H10O5]\\({}^{+}\\)). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAll of the spectroscopic characteristics of **1** were coincident with those of anthrones which we have previously reported (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at _l_max 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)), ester carbonyl (1735 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) groups. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at \\(d\\) 7.4-7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of _meta_-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at \\(d\\) 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at \\(d\\) 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at \\(d\\) 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at \\(d\\) 3.40-3.95, indicating sugar moieties.\n\nThe presence of 33 carbons was evident from the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at \\(d\\) 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at \\(d\\) 95.8 and \\(d\\) 105.4. Signals in the region of \\(d\\) 62-81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D-E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agreement with lyxose (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on Solis et al. (1995) which identified the sugar of picramniosides A-C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-_O_ were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments confirmed only one CH\\({}_{2}\\) signal at \\(d\\) 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit.\n\nComplete assignment of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In particular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between the ester carbonyl (_d_ 164.7) and H-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\), H-2\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) and H-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\), indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) (_d_ 81.4), confirming the position of the aglycone at C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a \\({}^{3}J\\) correlation of the anomeric\n\n## Page 3\n\nproton of the glucose unit (H-1, \\(d\\) 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the _O_-glucose unit at C-8.\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between H-5' and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. The configuration of the lysrose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (Solis et al., 1995; Hernandez-Medel et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-1' and H-2' (_J_ = 0 Hz) suggesting an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. Likewise, the \\(J\\) value of H-5'' (12 Hz) indicated an _ax_-_ax_ conformation for H-5'' and H-4'' in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety.\n\nFurther observations helped to establish the configuration at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of **1** (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picraminoside E (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the following expected differences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to _O_-glucosylation at C-8.\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of **2** gave pseudo-molecular ions at _m_/_z_ 709 ([M + Na]+) and 725 ([M + K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]-), which was consistent with the molecular formula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS-MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (_m_/_z_ 563), lysose (_m_/_z_ 432), CH2OH (_m_/_z_ 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corresponding to emodin (269).\n\nAs observed previously for the mayosides (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed the same pattern described for **1**, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of **2** had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). _O_-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound **2** at ring A.\n\nAsignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with published data (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not afford all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1'' with C-1 (_d_ 162) helped to confirm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1''.\n\nCircular dichroism confirmed the absolute configuration at C-10 of **1** and **2** as \\(S\\) and \\(R\\), respectively.

(1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds **3** and **4** presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in _Sesamm indicum_. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nMp: uncorr.; IR: BOMEM-FT-IR; UV: Hewlett Packard 8452A; 1H NMR, COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HSQC, HMBC and 13C NMR, in methanol-_d__a_, containing TMS as int. standard: Bruker DRX-400; ESIMS: Micromass Quattro LC, HRMS: Autospec-Micromass EBE.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe bark of _P. taepensis_ was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San Jose de la Montana, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica.\n\n### Isolation of constituents\n\nDried and powdered bark of _P. taepensis_ (615 g) was macerated with EtOH-H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then _n_-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC.

(Rubiaceae), a huge endemic tree from the Amazon, has been traditionally used for the treatment of numerous human ailments including mycoses, influenza, diverse infections, cancer and skin diseases throughout \"legal Amazonia,\" which includes Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia (Correa, 1974; Rizzini, 1978; Garcia, 1975). In Peruvian Amazon, a decoction of the bark is used against \"sarma nerga\", a subcutaneous infection caused by an arachinid (Schultes and Raffauf, 1990). In Brazilian Amazon, this species is known to treat stomach diseases, skin inflammation and uterus tumors (Garcia, 1975). As part of our continuing efforts to study Brazilian Rubiaceae, mainly those with medicinal uses (Carbonezi et al., 1998), _C. spruceanum_ DC was collected near Manaus, Amazon State, and submitted to a detailed chemical study. Three new _seco_-iridoids were obtained from the ethanolic extract of _C. spruceanum_ wood bark: 7-methoxydiderroside (**1**), 6'-acetyl-b-D-glucopyranosyldiderroside (**2**) and 8-\\(O\\)-tigolyldiderroside (**3**), and the known compounds loganetin (Houghton and Ming, 1985), loganin (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Garcia and Chulia, 1986), kingiside (Inouye et al., 1974), secoxyloganin (Calis and Sticher, 1984) and diderroside (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). Several natural products and synthetic compounds, e.g. sesquiterpenelactones from Asteraceae species (Chiari et al., 1991), lignans from _Virola surinamensis_ (Myristicaceae) (Lopes et al., 1998) and quinoline derivatives (Nakayama et al., 2001) have been evaluated for antitrypanosomal activity against _T. cruzi_, the parasite of Chagas disease, which affects ca. 18 million people in Latin America and ca. 100,000 people in the United States. Besides prophylaxis, i.e. the elimination of vector insect, specific therapeutic agents are needed in order to replace gentian violet, currently in use, owing to the mutagenic and\n\n## Page 2\n\ncarcinogenic potentials of this dye, as well as to consumer resistance to this treatment since the patient turns blue after transfusion. In this paper, the isolation and structure elucidation of the new _seco_-irridoids **1-3** along with the known compounds are presented. Additionally, the biological evaluation of all isolates against the trypanastigote forms (Y form) of _T. cruzi_ was undertaken. The taxonomic significance of these _seco_-irridoids in _C. spruceannum_, is also discussed.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe ethanolic extract of dried and powdered wood bark of _C. spruceannum_ was successively fractionated over a silica gel column and finally purified by reversed phase HPLC (see Experimental), affording the new _seco_-irridoids **1-3**. _seco_-Irridoid **1** was isolated as an amorphous powder that gave a [M+H]+ ion at _m_/_z_ 479.4539 in the high-resolution TOF-ESMS compatible with the molecular formula C20H30O13. The UV maximum at 230 nm and IR absorptions at 3450, 1695, 1635 and 1280 cm-1 suggested that **1** had a conjugated double bond and an end ether, which is characteristic of the chromophore -OCO-C=CH-O- of iridoids. This assumption was supported by the NMR signal observed at \\(d\\) 7.44 (1H, _s_) characteristic of H-3 from iridoids. Besides this signal, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed three doublets at \\(d\\) 5.66 (1H, \\(J\\) = 4.5 Hz), 4.54 (1H, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and 1.26 (3H, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz), one double quadruplet at \\(d\\) 4.97 (1H, \\(J\\) = 4.0; 6.5 Hz) and several signals compatible with a glucosyl unit. In addition, the signals at \\(d\\) 1.92 (3H, _s_), 3.54 (3H, _s_) and 3.58 (3H, _s_) analyzed with 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 2), revealed the presence of an acetyl and two methoxyl groups. The 13C NMR spectroscopic spectrum exhibited twenty signals (4CH3, 2CH2, 10CH, and 4C) whose chemical shift values and multiplicities obtained from the DEPT-135+ experiment strongly support the _seco_-iridoid skeleton for **1**, especially the signals of C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9 and C-10 at \\(d\\) 28.6, 34.7, 172.0, 68.6 and 42.2 respectively. The structure of **1** was confirmed by 2D-NMR spectral analysis including 1H-1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments. In the HMBC experiment, long-range correlations were observed between the following protons and carbons (H-1 and C-3, 5, 8, 1'; H-3 and C-5, 11; H-5 and C-3, 7, 1; H-8 and C-1, 5, 10, carbonyl of acetate) as shown in Fig. 1. The relative configuration of the stereogenic centers C-1, C-5, C-8 and C-9 was established by analyzing coupling constant values, NOESY experiments and comparison with literature data (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). The above evidence indicated **1** as the new derivative 7-methoxydiderroside (**1**).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline\n**H** & **1** & **2** & **3** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 5.66 \\(d\\) (4.5) & 5.58 \\(d\\) (6.5) & 5.76 \\(d\\) (6.5) \\\\\n3 & 7.44 \\(s\\) & 7.42 \\(d\\) (0.5) & 7.42 \\(s\\) \\\\\n4 & – & – & – \\\\\n5 & 3.10 \\(m\\) & 3.28 \\(m\\) & 3.20 \\(m\\) \\\\\n6 & 2.48 _dd_ (8.9, 16.02).85 _dd_ (7.5, 16.0) & – & 2.34 _dd_ (8.0, 16.0)2.78 _dd_ (7.2, 16.0) \\\\\n7 & – & – & – \\\\\n8 & 4.97 _dq_ (4.0, 6.5) & 5.00 _dq_ ( 4.5, 7.0) & 5.09 _dq_ (3.5, 6.5) \\\\\n9 & 2.08 _dd_ (4.0, 4.5, 9.5) & 2.12 _dd_ (4.5, 6.5, 9.0) & 2.16 _dd_ (3.5, 6.5, 8.5) \\\\\n10 & 1.26 \\(d\\) (6.5) & 1.27 \\(d\\) (7.0) & 1.30 \\(d\\) (6.5) \\\\\n11 & – & – & – \\\\\n1′ & 4.54 \\(d\\) (7.5) & 4.59 \\(d\\) (8.0) & 4.59 \\(d\\) (8.0) \\\\\n2′ & 3.18 _dl_ (7.5, 11.2) & 3.41 _dt_ (8.0, 9.5) & 2.99 \\(m\\) \\\\\n3′ & 3.16 \\(m\\) & 3.21 \\(m\\) & 3.18 \\(m\\) \\\\\n4′ & 3.12 \\(m\\) & 3.01 \\(m\\) & 3.01 \\(m\\) \\\\\n5′ & 3.06 \\(m\\) & 3.14 _dd_ (2.0, 6.5, 9.0) & 3.20 \\(m\\) \\\\\n6′ & 3.68 _dd_ (5.0, 12.4).73 _dd_ (5.7, 12.4) & 4.26 _dd_ (3.2, 12.0).06 _dd_ (6.5, 12.0) & 3.70 _dd_ (5.6, 11.5)3.98 _dd_ (6.8, 11.5) \\\\ OMe-7 & 3.58 \\(s\\) & 3.60 \\(s\\) & 3.59 \\(s\\) \\\\ OMe-11 & 3.54 \\(s\\) & – & – \\\\ AcO-8 & 1.92 \\(s\\) & 1.92 \\(s\\) & – \\\\ AcO-6′ & – & 2.0 \\(s\\) & – \\\\\n1′ & – & – & – \\\\\n2′′ & – & – & – \\\\\n3′′ & – & – & 6.79 _dq_ (1.5, 7.2) \\\\\n4′′ & – & – & 1.76 \\(d\\) (1.5) \\\\\n5′ & – & – & 1.74 _br s_ \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectral data for _seco_-irridoids **1–3** (500 MHz) in DMSO-_d_δ_a\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral signals (Tables 1 and 2) for compound **2** were found to be similar to those observed for **1**, except for the lack of one methoxyl group and one additional acetyl group. The change from one methoxyl to one acetyl group was also observed by HRTOF-ESMS, which showed a molecular ion peak at \\(m/z\\) [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) 507.4725. In fact, when the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data of compound **2** were compared with those of diderroside, the only difference observed was the presence of one additional acetyl group inferred by the chemical shift values at \\(\\delta\\) 20.6 (correlating with the singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 2.00, in the HMQC spectrum), and \\(\\delta\\) 170.3. It was also observed that the signals attributed to the hydroxymethylene carbon and hydrogens in the glucosyl unit are deshielded [\\(\\delta\\) 63.4; 4.26 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 3.2, 12.0 Hz) and 4.06 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 12.0 Hz)], when compared with the values observed in a typical glucose moiety present in iridoids (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Boros and Stermitz, 1990; Boros and Stermitz, 1991). From the HMBC spectrum of **2** (Fig. 1), the diagnostic long-range correlations were observed, including those from H-8 to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 169.3; from H-10 to C-8 and C-9; and from H-6 to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 173.0. In addition, the correlation of H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\) to C-4\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) as well as to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 170.3, established the position of the acetyl group at C-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\). The cross peak observed for the methyl at \\(\\delta\\) 2.00 to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 170.3, was definitive to indicate that this acetyl was linked to hydroxymethylene C-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of the glucosyl moiety and establish the structure of **2** as being 6\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-acetyl-b-d-glucopyranosyldiderroside.\n\nCompound **3** was obtained as a brown amorphous solid. The molecular formula, C\\({}_{22}\\)H\\({}_{32}\\)O\\({}_{13}\\) was established by HRTOF-ESMS (_m/z_ 527.4797 [M + Na]\\({}^{+}\\)). This compound also presented a sulphuric vanillin coloration identical to those of **1** and **2** suggesting that it was an iridoid. Its UV spectrum (\\(\\lambda_{\\rm max}^{\\rm MoOH}\\) 230, 297 nm), as well as its \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data indicated that\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline C & **1** & **2** & **3** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 94.9 & 95.0 & 94.1 \\\\\n3 & 152.5 & 152.1 & 152.1 \\\\\n4 & 108.7 & 109.1 & 109.1 \\\\\n5 & 28.6 & 28.0 & 28.0 \\\\\n6 & 34.7 & 34.6 & 34.4 \\\\\n7 & 172.0 & 173.0 & 173.0 \\\\\n8 & 68.6\n\n## Page 4\n\n3 consisted of a diderroside-like structure. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed one signal for hydrogen H-3 at \\(d\\) _d_ 7.42 (1H, _s_), which suggested the presence of an iridoid skeleton, a doublet at \\(d\\) 4.59 (1H, \\(J\\) = 8.0) and several signals ranging from \\(d\\) 2.99 to 3.70 attributed to the anomeric, methine and methylene hydrogens of the glucosyl moiety. The signals at \\(d\\) 5.09 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 3.5, 6.5 Hz), and 1.30 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz) were compatible with those from diderroside skeleton type for this compound, as in **1** and **2**. However, additional NMR spectral signals at \\(d\\) 6.79, 1.76 and 1.74, and the signals at \\(d\\) 137.4, 14.1 and 11.8, indicated that this compound exhibited significant differences from the signals observed in diderrosides **1** and **2**. The 1H-1H COSY spectrum from **3** showed a cross peak between the signal at \\(d\\) 6.79 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 1.5, 6.5) and the signal at \\(d\\) 1.76 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.5). In the HMQC experiments the signals at \\(d\\) 1.74 (3H, _br s_), 1.76 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.5) attributed to H-5'' and H-4'' respectively and \\(d\\) 6.79 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 1.5, 6.5), correlated with the carbons at \\(d\\) 11.8 (C-5''), 14.1 (C-4'') and 137.4 (C-3''), respectively. The combined analysis from these data and the presence of a _sp_2 carbon at \\(d\\) 128.1 suggested the existence of a tigloyl unit in this molecule, which was further determined to be linked at C-8 (_d_ 68.6). The HMBC correlations between the signal for H-8 at \\(d\\) 5.09 with carbons C-1'' (_d_ 166.3), C-10 (_d_ 18.8) and C-1 (_d_ 94.1); H-3 at \\(d\\) 7.42 with carbons C-11 (_d_ 166.2), C-4 (_d_ 109.1); methoxyl hydrogens with C-11; H-3'' at \\(d\\) 6.79 with C-4'' (_d_ 14.1), C-2'' (_d_ 128.1) and C-1'' (_d_ 166.3) corroborated the proposed structure for **3** as 8-_O_-tigolydidterroside.\n\nThis is the first report on the chemical composition of _C. sprucemann,_ a species included in Clinchonoidee, which revealed the presence of iridoid and _seco_-iridoids, a chemical profile quite different from those previously described (Bolzani et al., 1984). This sub-family is characterized by indole alkaloids, which are considered as their chemical markers (Young et al., 1996). A comparison of the chemical composition of _Calycophyllum_ with two species morphologically related such as _Chimarrhis_ (accumulates indole alkaloids) and _Bathysa_ (accumulates triterpenes and phenolics), revealed deep differences on the main isolated secondary metabolites. These species are often misplaced in their genera (Delprete, 1996), so further chemical studies on _Calycophyllum_ and allies will be useful to establish the boundaries of each genera, and will contribute to the taxonomic classification of Rubiaceae, which is considered a very complex taxon (Robbrecht, 1993).\n\nAll compounds were assayed in vitro against the trypanastigote forms (Y form) of _T. cruzi._ The new compounds **1**, **2** and the known secoxyloganin and diderroside displayed activity with IC50 values of 59.0, 90.2, 74.2 and 84.9 mg/ml, respectively, when compared with the standard gentian violet (IC50 7.5 mg/ml). Although these compounds have showed weak activities, to our knowledge this is the first report of the antitrypanosomal activity by _seco_-iridoids.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nOptical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 degC. UV spectra were recorded on Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as internal standard. ES-MS was conducted on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRTOF-ESMS was performed using a Q-Tof (Micro-mass) (40 eV). CC was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Sephadex LH 20 (Pharmacia), respectively. TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Prep HPLC was performed on Waters Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C-18 (250 mm x 21.20 mm, Phenomenex) columns.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _C. sprucemann_ plant material was collected in Manaus, Brazil, in July and August 1998. A voucher specimen was identified by Dr. J. A. da S. Cabral and deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA), Manaus (Voucher No 1998-182.249).\n\n### Bioassay screening\n\nIn vitro assay using trypanastigote forms (Y strain) from _T. cruzi_ was performed according to the protocol described in the literature (Bastos et al., 1999).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nPulverized dried wood bark from _C. sprucemann_ (1.7 kg) was extensively extracted using MeOH at room temp. The combined extracts were concentrated in vacuo to give a dark solid (230 g), which was partitioned between _n_-BuOH and H2O affording an _n_-BuOH (64 g) and an aqueous (107 g) soluble fraction. The _n_-BuOH fraction was suspended in aqueous MeOH 80% and successively partitioned with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction (20.8 g) was subjected to XAD-2 chromatograph using H2O with increasing proportions of MeOH (20-100%). Fractions I and II, obtained from this procedure, were further submitted to CC using Sephadex LH 20 as stationary phase and MeOH as isocratic mobile phase, yielding 21 fractions (F1-F21).\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nF-5 was further purified by means of HPLC coupled to a prep reversed phase column using MeOH/H2O/HOAC (23:76.6:0.5) as mobile phase, UV detection set at 280 nm and a flow rate of 10 mL.min-1, gave pure loganin (11.6 mg), diderroside (5.3 mg) and the new derivative **3** (11.6 mg). F-11 was purified with a similar chromatographic procedure, only varying the mobile phase MeOH/H2O (27.5:72.5), giving diderroside (12.3 mg). Fraction F-18 was also subjected to HPLC purification using MeOH/H2O/HOAc (27:72.5:0.5) as mobile phase, flow rate set at 8 mL.min-1 to afford secoxilogenin (5.7 mg), loganetin (2.0 mg), diderroside (2.1 mg) and the new compounds **1** (11 mg), **2** (13.6 mg) and **3** (1.2 mg).\n\n#### 3.4.1 Diderroside methyl ester (1)\n\nAmorphous powder; [a]25-36.0deg (MeOH; \\(c\\) 1.4); UV _l_max (CH3OH) nm (log _e_): 230 (4.6), 210.6 (4.2); IR _v_max (KBr) cm-1: 3450, 2944, 1712, 1695, 1635, 1280.

The latter two compounds appear to be novel. (c) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Murraya paniculata_ (Linn.) Jack, which is native to Southeast Asia, was introduced to Brazil and has flourished in Sao Paulo state. In Brazil it is used as an ornamental plant, but this plant is used for its medicinal properties in tropical and subtropical Asia [1]. A search for previous phytochemical studies of _M. paniculata_ revealed that only the coumarin, coumarin, has been reported from the ripe fruits of this species [2]. Working separately on peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits, we have isolated only polymethoxylated flavones, flavonols and flavononols.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe dichloromethane extract of the peel of _M. paniculata_ after successive chromatographic separations afforded six flavonoids: 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol [3, 4], 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (1) [5], 3,5,7,8,3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavone (2) [6], 5,7,8,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (3) [7], 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (4) and 8-hydroxy-3,5,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (5). Compounds 4 and 5 appear to be novel.\n\nThe 13C NMR data for 2 and 3 do not appear to have been reported in the literature. Thus, the 13C chemical shifts of 2 and 3 have been listed in Table 1 using 1 and 5,7,8,2',3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavone (6) [3] as models. The carbon signals of 1, isolated from _Neoraputia magnifica_ (Rutaceae), were assigned by use of HMQC and HMBC experiments [5].\n\nCompound 4 was obtained as a yellow powder. The presence of a flavonoid nucleus was suggested by its UV and IR spectra. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2) of 4, three aromatic protons appeared at \\(d\\) 6.43 (1H, _s_) and \\(d\\) _7.52 (2H, \\(s\\), H-2' and H-6'), one hydroxyl group at \\(d\\) 12.38 (1H, \\(s\\), OH-5) and six methoxy groups at \\(d\\) 3.95 (6H, _s_), 3.94 (6H, _s_), 3.92 (3H, _s_), and 3.90 (3H, _s_). The assignment of one singlet to H-2' and H-6' suggested that three methoxys were attached to the B-ring. Furthermore, the singlet at \\(d\\) 6.43 clearly indicated the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-hydroxy-7,8- and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3,7,8- and 5-hydroxy-3,6,7-tri-methoxyflavonol indicated that the C-6 methine (_ca_ \\(d\\) 96) resonates at a lower field than the C-8 methine (_ca_ \\(d\\) 91) [3]. Thus, the correct A-ring structure was, decided on the basis of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1), which showed a signal at \\(d\\) 95.5 for C-6, so placing the methoxy substituents at C-7 and C-8. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for three methyl oxyl groups at \\(d\\) 61.5, 61.0 and 60.3, indicating a 3-methoxyflavonol derivative and confirming the oxygenation patterns in the \\(A\\) and B-rings. This was corroborated by the fragments at _m/z_ 207 [C12H14O4-Me]+ and 181 [C6H8O5-Me]+, associated with the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of the C-ring followed by the loss of a methyl group, respectively. From these data 4 was characterized as 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 4',5-dihydroxy-3,3',7,8-tetra-methoxyflavone (ternatin, 7) and 4',5-dihydroxy\n\n## Page 2\n\n3,3',8-trimethoxy-7-(3-methylbut-2-enyloxy)-flavone (**8**) [8]. Complete and unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for **8** were made using the HMBC technique [8].\n\nCompound **5** exhibited similar NMR spectra to **4** (Table 1 and 2) except for the absence of the signal for one chelated hydroxyl. The mass spectrum indicated a molecular formula C2H2O9 ([M]+ = 418), which strongly suggested an isomer of **4**. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals for two methoxyl groups at \\(d\\) 61.3 and 60.1, which were assigned to the 3- and 4'- positions. This implies that the methoxyls in the A-ring were located at C-5 and C-7 (_d_ 56.4 and 56.1) and determined the position of the hydroxyl group at C-8. The 5,7,8- and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones can be differentiated by the 13C NMR chemical shifts of the unsubstituted methine which absorbs at \\(d\\) 92.6 (C-6, for example **6**) in the case of the former [3] and at \\(d\\) 96.3 (C-8, for example **1**) in the case of the latter. Thus, the 13C signal at \\(d\\) 91.6 for C-6 supported the proposed structure of **5** as 8-hydroxy-3,5,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone.\n\nA hexane-soluble fraction of the hydromethanolic extract of pulp after successive chromatographic separations afforded three flavonols: **4**, **9** and **10**. Compound **4** could not be separated from a small amount of **9**. The 1H NMR in addition to signals described above for **4**, revealed the presence of three protons in the B-ring, giving rise to an ABC coupling system (_d_ 7.02, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.8 Hz, H-5'; \\(d\\) 7.81, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-2'; \\(d\\) 7.86, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 8.8 and 2.0 Hz, H-6'). This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed fragments at _m_/_z_ 177 [C1H2O3 - Me]+ and 181 [C3H6O3 - Me]+ due to the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage \n\n## Page 3\n\nof the C-ring followed by loss of a methyl group, respectively. These data were consistent with the structure of 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone for **9**, which has been found previously in _Citrus reticulata_ (tangerine peel) [9].\n\nCompound **10** gave spectral data in agreement with those published for 3,5,6,7,3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavonol [10]. However, its \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data do not appear to have been reported previously in the literature. Thus, they have been listed in Table 1 using **1**, **2** and **3** as models.\n\nA dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the methanolic pulp extract gave four flavonoids: **3**, **5**, 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanol [3, 4] and 3,5,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone [3, 11].\n\nOther organs of _M. paniculata_ have long been the subject of extensive chemical investigations, which have proved that it is a rich source of coumarins, flavones and flavonoids as are other plants of the Auriatoideae [12]. The leaves have been reported to contain 2 [13], **3**[1, 13] and **10**[10], while **3** has also been found in the roots [7]. Flavonol **1** has been isolated from the leaves of _M. exotica_ [6], which has been considered to be a synonym of _M. paniculata_ [14]. By contrast, the flowers appear to be poor in flavonoids. However, the only flavonoid, 3,5,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone, reported from the flowers shows an oxidation level comparable to those of the leaves.\n\nFlavonol **9**, 3,5,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone and 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol are reported for the first time from the _Murraya_, while the latter does not appear to have been recorded previously from the Rutaceae.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL\n\n_General._ NMR: Bruker ARX 400, with TMS as int. standard; GC-MS: low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument; R-HPLC (recycling HPLC): model Shimadzu LC-6AD; the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 x 20 mm, 5 \\(\\mu\\)m particle size, 100 A pore diameter; eluent: hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (5:15:0.3); flow rate: 3.0 ml min-1; detection (Shimadzu SPD-GAV): V \\(\\lambda\\) 254 nm.\n\n_Plant material.

The seeds, peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits were sepd by a perforated plate sieve (0.5 mm; tyler 32). The seeds and peel were dried, powdered and successively extracted with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH. The pulp was stirred with MeOH at room temp. The extract was decanted, and the residual pulp similarly extracted a second time. The combined extracts were evapd under vacuum and the residue partitioned into hexane-, CH2Cl2-, MeOH- and _n_-BuOH-soluble frs.\n\nThe concd CH2Cl2 extract of peel was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane-Me2CO (9:1), yielding 48 frs. Fr 23 was chromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (10:10:1) as eluents affording further frs. Fr 23-4 purified x 2 by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 10:10:1) to yield a mixt. of **1** and 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol (40 mg), which was sepd by R-HPLC (detection UV \\(l\\) 254 nm) to give 1 (1st peak, 18 mg) and 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol (2nd peak, 16 mg), after recycling x 3/Fr 33 was purified by prep.

Brum, Neli K. Honda, Sonia C. Hess, Alberto J. Cavalheiro\n\n# Abstract\n\nIn addition to 3-acetyl aleuritolic acid, 3_b_-acetyl-, cinnamoyl-, dihydroxymethyl-lupool, a new ester of lupool has been isolated from the stems of _Cnidoscolus vitifolius_. Its structure was established to be 3_b_-hexanoyl lupool by spectroscopic methods. (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved\n\n## Introduction\n\nCnidoscolus vitifolius is a latex-producing plant growing in the higher lands of the \"pantanal\" of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. It is used in folk medicine for the treatment of callosities and cataract [1], and is known by the vernacular name of \"cansancao\". In this communication we report the isolation from the stems of _C. vitifolius_ of 3-acetyl aleuritolic acid, a mixture of sterols, and four 3_b_-lupool esters, one of which is a new compound.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nIn addition to 3-acetyl aleuritolic acid and a mixture of sterols, the methylene dichloride extract of the stems yielded four acyl derivatives of lupool (see Experimental). Three of them were identified by NMR techniques to be the known 3_b_-_O-cinnamoyl, -dihydrocinnamomoyl and -acetyl lupools [2, 3]. The other ester is a new compound, and was assigned structure **1**. Compound **1** was obtained as a dextrorotatory powder. The 1oC NMR spectrum exhibited for the triterpene moiety the same signals as other acyl lupools [2]. Additional signals were found for an ester function (d 173.7), four methylenes (d 34.8, 31.3, 24.8 and 22.3) and a methyl (d 13.9), which agree for an hexanloyl group. Accordingly, the 1H NMR spectrum showed a triplet (_J_ = 7.5 Hz) at d 2.29 for the methylene a to the carboxyl group. An homologous compound, lupool heptanate, has been recently reported from _Acacia suma_ (Leguminosaea) [4].\n\n## Introduction\n\n### _Cnidoscolus vitifolius_\n\nThe _Cnidoscolus vitifolius_ is a latex-producing plant growing in the higher lands of the \"pantanal\" of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.

Pinheiro Ferreira, Andre G. Santos, Aristeu G. Tininis, Patricia M. Costa, Alberto J. Cavalheiro, Vanderlan S. Bolzani, Manoel O. Moraes, Leticia V. Costa-Lotufo, Raquel C. Montenegro, Claudia Pessoa\n\n# Abstract\n\nClerodane diterpenes have demonstrated cytotoxic; antiplasmodial and anti-ulcer properties. In the present work, we determined the cytotoxic effect of casearin L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (--)-hardwickic acid isolated from _Casearin sylvestris_ leaves, and investigated the underlying mechanisms involved in _in vitro_ cell death induced by Cas X in HL-60 leukemia cells (0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 mM). Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that Cas X was the most active compound studied, showing greater cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 lines (Isc\\({}_{50}\\) of 0.4 mM) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, Isc\\({}_{50}\\) of 1.2 mM). After 24th exposure, Cas X caused a decrease in 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (36.6 and 24.5% labeling at 0.7 and 1.5 mM, respectively), reduction in viability, and increase in apoptotic and necrotic leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner evidenced by the trypan blue and _A_O/EB (acridine orange/ethidium bromide) assays. Moreover, Cas X-treated cells exhibited nuclear fragmentation and cytoplasmic vacuolization depending on the concentration tested. These characteristics of apoptosis or secondary necrosis were confirmed by flow cytometry which revealed DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, activation of the effector caspases 3/7 and mitochondrial depolarization. We then found evidence that Cas X causes cell death via apoptotic pathways, corroborating the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCancer is a pathological consequence with multifactorial causes such as mutations in specific genes (proto-oncogenes/tumor suppressors) or post-translational modifications of proteins, where key events can increase cancer risk and lead to uncontrolled proliferation [1]. Chemotherapy remains the most important line of defense for patients with hematological malignancies and aggressive forms of solid tumors. However, drug toxicity and efficacy vary widely among these patients [2]. Many drugs normally kill cancer cells by inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, two forms of cell death with distinct morphological and biochemical features [3-5]. In this scenario, plant compounds have made valuable contributions to the discovery of new naturally occurring anticancer agents, especially those from tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world [6].\n\n#### Casearia sylvestris\n\nSwartz (Salicaceae), a medicinal tree that grows practically throughout the entire Brazilian territory from Amazonas State (Tapajos River region) to Rio Grande do Sul State [7,8], is popularly known as \"guacatonga,\" \"cafezinho-do-mato,\" \"cafe-Silvestre\" and \"erva-de-bugre.\" Its leaves are used for treating traumas, for skin and oral wound healing and as a topical anesthetic and antiseptic [7,9]. _In vitro_ and pre-clinical studies have highlighted its anti-inflammatory [10-12], antimicrobial [13-15], antiplasmodial [16], and anti-ulcer [11,17,18] properties.\n\nPhytochemical investigations of _C. sylvestris_ leaf extracts have led to the discovery of bioactive clerodanes, the casearins and casearvestrins, which are oxygenated tricyclic diterpenes with excellent cytotoxic and antitumor potential [14,19,20-22]. Despite their well-known antiproliferative actions, there are no studies showing how these diterpenes cause cell death, although Huang et al. [23] have suggested that clerodane diterpenes isolated from _Casearia membranacea_ induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells (human prostate tumor line).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nIn this work, we determined the cytotoxic activity of clerodane diterpenes [casearins L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (-)-hardwickiic acid isolated from C. _sylvestris_ leaves and investigated the cytotoxic effects of Cas X on HL-60 leukemia cells and the underlying mechanisms involved in its _in vitro_ cytotoxic action.\n\n## Material and methods\n\n### Plant material and structure determination\n\nLeaves of _C. sylvestris_ were collected at the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (Sao Miguel Arcanjo, Sao Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium 'Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann' (Instituto Botanico do Estado de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identified by Dr. lines Cordiero (Instituto Botanico do Estado de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of _C. sylvestris_ were extracted with ethanol in a stainless steel extractor with solvent teruka for ca. 24 h at 40 degC. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) and dried in desiccators over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield a dry residue.\n\nThe structure of the compounds caearins L, O, X and (-)-hardwickiic acid was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in Santos et al. [21] and Santos et al. [22].\n\n### Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes [(Cas L, Cas O, Cas X and (-)-hardwickiic acid)] was evaluated by the MTT assay [24] against 3 human leukemia cell lines: HL-60, K-562 and GEM, all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, at 37 degC with 5% CO2. By an indirect way, tumor cell proliferation was quantified through the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product [24]. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates and diterpenes (0.01-10 uM) were added to wells. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT 10%. Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 uLDMSO and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX 880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin (Dox, Sigma Aldrich) was used as a positive control (0.02-8.6 uM).\n\nTo avoid false proliferation data, the experiments were performed in triplicate and the proliferation rate was always compared to negative controls. In all replicates, similar inhibition rates and cell proliferation in negative control wells were higher than in the treated wells.\n\n### Alamar Blue assay\n\nIn order to investigate the selectivity of Cas X for normal proliferating cells, the Alamar Blue(tm) assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug exposure. All studies were performed in accordance with Brazilian research guidelines (Law 196/96, National Council of Health).\n\nHeparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug for at least 15 days prior to sampling, aged between 18 and 30 years old) was collected, and PBMC were isolated by a standard method of density-gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 3 x 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 u/mL streptomycin at 37 degC with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (4%) was added at the beginning of culture, according to Cavancanti et al. [25] with some modifications. PBMC were then plated in 96-well plates (3 x 105 cells/well in 100 uL of medium). After 24 h, the test compound (0.01-10 uM) dissolved in 1% DMSO was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for another 72 h. Dox (0.02-8.6 uM) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incubation, 10 uL of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma Aldrich Co) were added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiple reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter(r)), and the drug effect was quantified as the percentage of control absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of medium only is also measured at the higher and lower wavelengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOHW. A correction factor R0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOHW, where \\(R\\)0 = AOHW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced is then expressed as follows: % Reduced = _A_LW - (_A_HW \\(R\\)0) x 100.\n\n### Evaluation of mechanism involved in leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity\n\nThe following experiments were performed in order to investigate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect of Cas X. The doses were chosen based on IC50 values of Cas X in HL-60 cells after 24-h exposure. Cas X dissolved in sterile DMSO was added to HL-60 cell cultures (0.3 x 106 cells/mL) to obtain final concentrations of 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 uM (IC50/2, IC50 and 2 x IC50, respectively). Dox, 0.6 uM, was used as a positive control.\n\n#### Trypan blue exclusion\n\nCell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay [26]. Aliquots from each well were removed from cultures after 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber.\n\n#### Inhibition of DNA synthesis\n\nHL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with Cas X. Before the end of drug exposure, 20 uL of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) were added to each well and the cells incubated for another 3 h at 37 degC. To determine the amount of BrdU incorporated into DNA, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature [27]. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and coverslipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was performed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per slide to determine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells.\n\n#### Staining with hematoxylin-eosin\n\nUntreated or Cas X-treated HL-60 cells were examined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metrimpex Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar Lab(r)). To evaluate morphology, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, fixed with methanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H8E, Sigma Aldrich Co. - St. Louis, MO/USA).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n#### 2.4.4 Morphological analysis using fluorescence microscopy\n\nAcridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining of HL-60 cells was performed to determine the cell death pattern induced by increasing concentrations of Cas X. Although AO and EB are DNA intercalating molecules, the first is able to cross intact membranes and confers green appearance to the nucleus of viable cells. On the other hand, EB is incorporated mainly by non-viable cells or in the presence of membrane instability, staining nucleus in red [28]. So, after 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted, and each sample was mixed with 1 mL of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 mg/mL of AO in PBS; 100 mg/mL EB in PBS) just prior to fluorescence microscopy analysis and quantification (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hundred cells were counted per sample and scored as follows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells [29].\n\n#### 2.4.5 Flow cytometry analysis\n\nAll flow cytometry analyses were performed in a Guava EasyCytre Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cell debris was omitted from the analysis.\n\n##### 2.4.5.1 Cell membrane integrity\n\nCell membrane integrity was evaluated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich Co. - St. Louis, MO/USA). Briefly, 100 mL of treated and untreated cells were incubated with propidium iodide (50 mg/mL). The cells were then incubated for 5 min. Fluorescence was measured and cell morphology, granularity and membrane integrity were determined [30].\n\n##### 2.4.5.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation\n\nInternucleosomal DNA fragmentation was evaluated by the incorporation of propidium iodide (50 mg/mL). Briefly, HL-60 cells were treated and then incubated at 25 degC for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 mg/mL propidium iodide. Fluorescence was measured and DNA fragmentation was analyzed [31].\n\n##### 2.4.5.3. Measurement of mitochondrial transmembrane potential\n\nMitochondrial depolarization was evaluated by incorporation of rhodamine 123 (Sigma Aldrich Co. - St. Louis, MO/USA). Rhodamine 123 is a cell-permeable, cationic, fluorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria without inducing cytotoxic effects. Briefly, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 mL of 1 mg/mL rhodamine 123 for 15 min in the dark. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Fluorescence was measured and percentage mitochondrial depolarization was determined [29].\n\n##### 2.4.5.4. Phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization\n\nPS externalization was demonstrated by flow cytometry after PS staining with annexin V according to the method described by Vermes et al. [32]. Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in 135 mL of PBS with 5 mL of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and 10 mL of annexin V-PE (Guava Nexin Assay Kit). The cells were gently vortexed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (20-25 degC) in the dark. Afterward, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (EasyCytre from Guava Technologies). Annexin V is a phospholipid-binding protein that has a high affinity for PS. 7-AAD, a cell impermeant dye, is used as an indicator of membrane structural integrity. Fluorescence of annexin V-PE was measured at 583 nm (yellow fluorescence) and 7-AAD at 680 nm (red fluorescence). The percentages of early and late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells were then calculated.\n\n##### 2.4.5.5. Detection of caspases 3 and 7\n\nCaspase 3/7 activity was estimated by flow cytometry, using the Guava EasyCytre Caspase Kit, after 24 h of incubation. HL-60 cells (3 x 105 cells/mL) were incubated with Fluorescent Labeled Inhibitor of Caspases (FLICA) and maintained for 1 h at 37 degC and 5% CO2. After incubation, 80 mL of washing buffer were added and cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 mL of washing buffer and centrifuged again. The cells were then resuspended in the working solution (propidium iodide 1:200 in 1x washing buffer) and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nFor cytotoxicity studies, the IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). In order to determine differences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman-Keuls test (_p_ < 0.01).\n\n## Results\n\n### Cytotoxicity against tumor and normal cells\n\nCytotoxicity analyses by MTT after 72 h of incubation displayed that Cas X was the most active clerodane diterpene (Table 1), showing higher cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 cells with IC50 values of 0.4 mM for both cell lines. Interestingly, K-562 cells were more resistant to Cas X, displaying an IC50 of 9 mM. On the other hand, caesarins L and O were moderately cytotoxic while (-)-hardwickiic acid was ineffective in inhibiting cell proliferation. PBMC assay showed IC50 values of 1.2 (1.0-1.4) mM and 1.5 (1.1-2.0) mM for Cas X and Dox, respectively.\n\nAll following experiments were performed with HL-60 cells to investigate the mechanism of action of Cas X.\n\n### Cell viability, DNA synthesis and morphological changes\n\nHL-60 cells treated with Cas X had significantly reduced cell viability and increased number of non-viable cells (_p_ < 0.01), showing a dose-dependent effect after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1A).\n\nAiming to understand the antiproliferative effect of Cas X, BrdU incorporation into the DNA was measured. All experiments were performed in three concentrations (0.7, 1.5 and 3 mM), but the highest one did not allow a confident cell analysis after treatment,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} Cell line & Compound − IC50 μM/mL (μM)a \\\\ (−)-Hardwickiic acid & Casearin L & Casearin O & Casearin X & Doxorbitcin \\\\ (−) & 55(15.5) & 2.7 (5.2).2–1.3–4. & 2.6 (4.3).2–3.0 & 0.2 (0.4).0–2.0–3.0 & 0.02 (0.04).0–0.02–0.03 \\\\ HL-60 & 35(15.5) & >5 (15.5) & 3.3 (5.6).2–6.42 & 0.2 (0.4).0–1.0–2.0 & 0.02 (0.04).01–0.02 \\\\ K-562 & >5(15.5) & 2.5 (4.8).1–1.5–5. & 3.0 (5.1).2–4.2 & 4.8 (9.0).2–6.8–7.0 & 0.14 (0.24).09–0.23 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Cytotoxicity activity of clerodane diterpenes on human leukemia cell lines after 72 h of exposure evaluated by MTT assay.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nprobably because the concentration of 3uM is too higher, leading to destabilization of the plasma membrane and severe cell destruction, interfering in the morphological examination required by the method [33]. As seen in Fig. 1B, Cas X led to decreasing BrdU incorporation, with 36.6 and 24.5% labeling in relation to control at 0.7 and 1.5 uM, respectively (_p_ < 0.01), while Dox (0.6 uM) led to 26.5% BrdU labeling.\n\nTo establish whether the growth inhibition displayed by Cas X was related to the induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/EB staining by fluorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment, there was a reduction in the number of viable cells in a dose-dependent manner, while apoptotic and necrotic cells increased (_p_ < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was observed at the lower doses of 0.7 and 1.5 uM (82 and 88.1%, respectively), while at the highest dose, 3.0 uM, necrosis was the main cell death pattern (77.7%).\n\nTreated and untreated cells were examined under light microscopy following H/E staining. Control cells exhibited a typical non-adherent, round morphology with vacuolization (Fig. 2A), while Cas X-treated cells displayed a gradual chromatin condensation and fragmentation, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, cell shrinking and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C-E), especially at 1.5 uM (Fig. 2E). Dox (0.6 uM) induced a reduction in cell volume, along with nuclear disintegration and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B).\n\n### Mechanism of action underlying Cas X cytotoxicity - flow cytometry analysis\n\n#### Membrane disruption\n\nCas X induced plasma membrane disruption in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner (_p_ < 0.01, Fig. 3A), whereas at 1.5 uM (5.8%) and 3.0 uM, 24.6% of the cells showed membrane lysis when compared to untreated cells (1.4%). Doxorubicin, positive control, also caused membrane disruption (7.4%).\n\n#### Mithochondrial DNA fragmentation\n\nMitochondrial depolarization is a feature of apoptosis. HL-60 treated cells (Fig. 3C) showed mitochondrial depolarization at all concentrations tested: 23.2, 68.8 and 21.8%, for 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 uM, respectively. It is important to note that at the highest concentration (3.0 uM) a false mitochondrial repolarization occurred, which can be explained by severe cell destruction [33].\n\n#### Mithochondrial depolarization\n\nCaspase 3/7 activation was found with all concentrations tested (Fig. 3D). Early apoptotic cells were observed with 3.0 uM Cas X (17.3%). Meanwhile, an increase in late apoptosis (13.3, 27.7 and 10.8%) and necrosis (6.4, 6.9 and 6.1%) was observed in cells treated with 1.5 uM and 3.0 uM Cas X and Dox, respectively (_p_ < 0.01). No differences were observed at the lowest concentration of Cas X (0.7 uM).\n\n#### Mithophatidylserine externalization\n\nPhosphatidylserine (PS) detection is a hallmark of apoptosis; PS resides on the surface of the plasma membrane, where cell damage leads to its externalization [32]. Cells treated with Cas X at all concentrations displayed PS externalization (_p_ < 0.01, Fig. 4). The number of early apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner [10.1, 18.4 and 38.4% for cells treated with Cas X at 0.7 (Fig. 4C), 1.5 (Fig. 4D) and 3.0 uM (Fig. 4E), respectively]. Meanwhile, late apoptosis was more frequent at 1.5 and 3.0 uM (17.8 and 39.6%, respectively).\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\nDrug discovery from medicinal plants has played an important role in cancer chemotherapy. Of all the available anticancer drugs between 1940 and 2002, 40% were natural products _per_ se or natural product-derived [34,35]. Nevertheless, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, either because of undesired side effects or multi-drug resistance [2]. Therefore, it is very important to find new compounds with antineoplastic activity with more specificity against cancer cells and thus fewer side effects. In this way, _Casearia_ species have a wide range of biological activities [11,24,36,37] that make it a probable source of new active compounds with anticancer properties. In the present work, the cytotoxic effect of the clerodane diterpenes (-)-hardwickiic acid and casearins L, O and X isolated\n\nFig. 1: Effects of Caesarin X (Cas X 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 μM) on HL-60 leukemia cells after 24 h of incubation.

Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of measurement (S.E.M) from three independent experiments; \\(p\\) < 0.01 compared to control by ANOVA followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nfrom _C. sylvestris_ leaves was determined in three leukemia lines (CEM, HL-60 and K-562). Also, the cytotoxicity of Cas X was investigated in normal PBM proliferating cells. The underlying mechanism of action of Cas X was further evaluated using the HL-60 cell line as a model [33,38].\n\nMTT assays showed that all compounds tested were active against at least one cell line, where Cas X was the most active against HL-60 and CEM cell lines. PBMC were also sensitive to Cas X but 3-fold less than the leukemia cells. Only (-)-hardwickiic acid showed no cytotoxicity against the leukemia cell lines. Several authors have demonstrated that clerodane diterpenes, secondary metabolites present in _Casearia_ species, are cytotoxic to different tumor cell lines, such as colon (HCT-116), leukemia (HL-60), ovarian (A2780), prostate (PC-3), and normal fibroblasts (L-929, V-79) [14,22,37,39,40,41]. More recently, we demonstrated the cytotoxic capacity of the Cas X against leukemia (MOLT-4, IC50 value of 0.22 mM), melanoma (MDA/MB-435, 0.35 mM), nervous system (SF-295, 0.43 mM), and colon (HCT-8, 0.97 mM) cancer cells [22]. Concerning chemotherapeutic potential, it is important to determine if the compound shows harmful effects in normal dividing cells such as proliferating leukocytes [42]. Herein, the data institute a narrow selectivity of Cas X towards cancer cells, though we previously showed that Cas X was up to 12-fold more selective against adherent cancer lines when compared to normal fibroblasts [22].\n\nStructural comparison of known casearins revealed that the main differences in activity involve substitutions at C-2, C-6, C-7, C-18 and C-19. Replacement of the acyl group at C-6 markedly decreases activity of the derivatives, indicating that the bulkiness at that site is important for biological activity [20]. Cytotoxic effects of casein L, O and X seem to depend on the ring structure formed by carbons C-18 and C-19, since acid hydrolysis and opening of this ring leads to molecular instability and loss of bioactivity [37] as seen with (-)-hardwickiic acid, which does not inhibit cell proliferation (Fig. 5). Moreover, (-)-hardwickiic acid was one of the first differences reported in \\(C\\) sylvestris without the typical highly oxygenated backbone [21]. Many of the clerodanes that are highly oxygenated exhibit effective insect antifeedant, antibacterial, cytotoxic and antifungal properties [14,41,43].\n\nThe antiproliferative effects of Cas X in leukemia cells were confirmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, BrdU incorporation and flow cytometry. Furthermore, morphological analysis using HE and AO/BE staining after 24 h of incubation revealed that treated cells displayed typical apoptotic and necrotic features, including signs\n\nFig. 2: Morphology of untreated and Casearin X-treated HL-60 cells after 24 h of incubation.

In fact, Cas X-treated cells displayed apoptotic features concentrations as low as 0.7 uM with an increase in necrotic cells at 3.0 uM, probably as a result of a later apoptosis stage.\n\nGenerally, apoptotic cells simultaneously show membrane integrity and high rates of DNA fragmentation [5]. Since PI enters the cells only if the membrane becomes permeable, it is widely\n\nFig. 4: Analyses of phosphatidylinositolserine externalization performed with Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-A\\(\\cdot\\)AD) in HL–60 cells treated with Casearin X [Cas 0.7 (C), 1.5 (D) and 3.0 μM (E)] and determined by flow cytometry after 24 h exposure.

Also, a critical stage of apoptosis involves the acquisition of surface changes by dying cells, which trigger their specific recognition and removal by phagocytes, where the latter could eventually prevent potential tissue injury resulting from cell lysis _in situ_[44]. This cell engulfment is signaled by externalization of PS, a phospholipid predominantly observed on the inner surface facing the cytosol [32]. If apoptosis is activated, PS on the external leaflet of the lipid bilayer can be detected using annexin V, a 35-kDa Ca2+-binding protein, with high affinity for PS. The lower dose effects observed after Cas X treatment were membrane integrity, mitochondrial depolarization, DNA fragmentation and PS externalization, all features of apoptosis. As a nuclear feature of apoptosis, the internucleosomal fragmentation of double-stranded DNA is attributed to caspases, cysteine aspartate-specific proteases synthesized as zymogens that cleave different proteins, such as caspase-3, the major effector caspase that predominantly disintegrates laminin and nuclear mitotic apparatus proteins [45]. With increasing concentration of Cas X, necrosis features such as loss of membrane integrity, loss of mitochondrial depolarization, and caspase 3/7 highly activated were observed after Cas X treatment. These data confirm those obtained with morphological approaches (trypan blue exclusion and AO/EB and H&E staining) in which dose-dependent effects were observed, suggestive of secondary necrosis or late apoptosis.\n\nSecondary necrosis occurs when apoptotic cells cannot maintain ATP production or control oxidative stress [46]. Dose-dependent regulation of cellular processes is one of the most important characteristics of signaling molecules naturally occurring in cells. Therefore, depending on the concentration used, many different processes may be influenced and/or altered [47]. The data presented here are at odds with a previous work by Carvalho et al. [13] who demonstrated that casearins G, S and T displayed DNA damage via acetylation in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ mutants. Our findings are also in agreement with those of Huang et al. [23] who discovered that caseamenbrins A-F, clerodane diterpenes isolated from _C. membranacea_ leaves, are able to activate caspase-8 and -9 in PC-3 cells.\n\nIn conclusion, the data presented in this work demonstrate that casearins L, O and X have a strong cytotoxic effect on leukemia cell lines, while (-)-hardwickic acid does not, which is probably related to the highly oxygenated backbone present in the casearins and absent in (-)-hardwickic acid. Also, we provide strong evidence that Cas X exerts its cytotoxic effect through induction of apoptosis, which emphasizes the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties and as interesting lead molecules for the design of new anticancer drugs.\n\n## Conflicts of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank CNPq, Instituto Claude Bernard, FAPESP, FUNCAP, and FINEP for the financial support.

Zanoni\n\nboldrinv@iq.unesp.br Instituto de Quimica-UNESP, Universidade Estadual Paulista, CP 355-CEP, 14801-970 Araraquara SP, Brazil\n\nReceived 11 December 2002; received in revised form 20 August 2003; accepted 29 September 2003\n\n###### Abstract\n\nThe electrochemical oxidation of caffeic, chlorogenic, sinapic, ferulic and _p_-coumaric acids was investigated by cyclic voltammetry on acetate buffer pH 5.6 on glassy carbon electrode and modified glassy carbon electrode. According to their voltammetric behavior, the antioxidant activity of these phenolic acids was evaluated and the results pointed to the following sequence: caffeic acid (\\(E_{\\text{a}}=+0.31\\,\\text{V}\\)) > chlorogenic acid (\\(+0.38\\,\\text{V}\\)) > sinapic acid (\\(+0.45\\,\\text{V}\\)) > ferulic acid (\\(+0.53\\,\\text{V}\\)) > _p_-coumaric acid (\\(+0.73\\,\\text{V}\\)). The results were confirmed by DPPH test, which evidenced the strongest antiradical activity for compounds possessing the cathecol moiety (caffeic and chlorogenic acids). Linear calibration graphs were obtained for their determination at concentrations from \\(1\\times 10^{-4}\\) to \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\). The method was applied to orange juice. Selectivity was illustrated by the analysis of caffeic and chlorogenic acids electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode previously modified by electrochemical activation in the presence of ascorbic acid.\n\nkeywords: Phenolic antioxidants; Voltammetric methods; Electrochemical oxidation; Orange juice +\nFootnote †: journal: Journal of Food Composition and Analysis\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nDietary recommendations for healthy eating include the consumption of fruit juices (Williams, 1995) whose beneficial health effects are mostly ascribed to natural antioxidants. Although the majority of the evidence emphasizes the roles of vitamin E, vitamin C and \\(\\beta\\)-carotene, recent studies have highlighted the importance of the phenolic antioxidants in the total antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nCitrus phenolics represent a varied and widely studied class of compounds (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The phenolic substances of importance in orange can be classified into two groups: phenolic acids and related compounds and flavonoids. The most important phenolic acid in orange juice is cinnamic acid and its derivatives: ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The relative contribution of phenolic derivatives to the antioxidant potential is associated with their effectiveness as hydrogen donors, which is dependent on the number and arrangement of the hydroxyl groups and the extent of structural conjugation, as well as the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring (Rice-Evans et al., 2000; Miller et al., 1993; Clegg and Morton, 1968). The antiradical ability of organic compounds may be assessed by measuring the ease of their reaction with the stable free radical diphenylpycrylhydrazyl (DPPH _l_max 517 nm), leading to its reduced form (DPPH-H). Good free radical scavengers react fast leaving small amounts of unreduced DPPH, which indicates the presence of an effective antioxidant (Bonded et al., 1997).\n\nIn addition to their antioxidant capacity, fruit phenolics have been the subject of increased interest in the last few years because their presence can contribute to the sensory quality of the fruit and juice through their effect on color, bitterness, astringency and flavor. Therefore, different analytical methods are required for their quantification (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Cordella et al., 2002). Phenolic substances have characteristic ultraviolet spectra, which have been used to detect adulteration in orange juice by spectrophotometric techniques (Escarpa and Gonzalez, 2001; Frenzel and Krekler, 1995). These procedures have been replaced by chromatographic procedures, which provide more detailed information on samples containing several organic compounds (Escarpa and Gonzalez, 2001; Bocchi et al., 1996). For example, analytical procedures for ferulic acid have been based on gas chromatography with flame ionization or electron-capture detection following derivatization. HPLC methods for these phenolic compounds in orange juice have been used involving derivatization and/or solid-phase extraction coupled with UV, photodiode-array and fluorescence detection (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Bocchi et al., 1996; Moskvin et al., 1999; Karovicova and Simko, 2000; Miller and Rice-Evans 1997; Christofersen and Cardwell, 1996). Alternatively, serial coulometric detection of phenolic compounds has been used to generate multivariate data for differentiation of juices (Peyrat-Maillard et al., 2000).\n\nThe use of cyclic voltammetry as an instrumental tool for the evaluation of the total antioxidant capacity of the low-molecular-weight antioxidants (LMWAs) in both fluids (Chevion et al., 2000) and edible plants (Chevion et al., 1999) is well known. A cyclic voltammogram provides information describing the integrated antioxidant capacity, which arises in large part from the ability of the compound to donate electrons around the potential of the anodic wave. Most of the LMWAs are reducing agents, which quench reactive oxygen species through electron donation (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1985). Therefore, evaluation of the overall reducing power by cyclic voltammetry reflects the antioxidant activity of pure compounds as well as that of mixture of compounds. Most of the studies involving LMWA reports ascorbic acid as a major component in the cyclic voltammetry response identified by measure of anodic peak around \\(+\\) 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl/Cl\\({}^{-}\\) (Yu et al., 1996).\n\nGlassy carbon is the electrode material used extensively in electrochemistry for analysis of electroactive substances and as the basis for surface-modified electrodes. The electrochemical properties of this material can be improved by surface treatment (Bard and Faulkner, 1980).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nElectrochemical activation of the glassy carbon electrode through oxidation and reduction of the electrode surface is a widely used method to change its characteristics. Many authors (Zhang et al., 1996; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Golabi and Zare, 1999; Moreno et al., 2000) have demonstrated that this procedure can improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the electroanalytical method application. For instance, the electrode can present a good performance for catalysis and/or applications as electrochemical detectors for significant types of analytes due to selective chemical or physical interaction between specific functional groups generated on its surface and selective species in solution.\n\nIn spite of the high sensitivity and selectivity of electroanalytical methods and the great importance of phenolic acids in orange juice, few studies have been conducted on the application of this technique for their determination. So, the aim of the present work was to investigate the electrochemical behavior of cinnamic acid and its derivatives (Fig. 1) on glassy carbon electrode. In addition, the possibility of using electroactivated glassy carbon electrode for oxidation of ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was studied for their selective determination in orange juice without interference of ascorbic acid. In order to confirm the effectiveness of these phenolic acids as free radical scavengers and to correlate this activity with the electrochemical behavior, a spectrophotometric test using DPPH as a substrate was also undertaken.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Apparatus and procedures\n\nThe electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Metrohm Polarecord E 506 linked to a compatible microcomputer through a Microquimica interface. The multimode electrode\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structures of (a) cinnamic acid, (b) caffeic acid (c) chlorogenic acid, (d) _p_-coumaric acid, (e) ferulic acid and (f) sinapic acid.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nMetrohm stand 663 VA was used and a glassy carbon disc (0.02 cm\\({}^{2}\\)) from Metrohm was used as the working electrode. A carbon auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl/Cl\\({}^{-}\\) (3.0 mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrode modification was based on the following procedure described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999). The glassy carbon electrode surface was polished with 0.05 um alumina suspension and rinsed with water. The electrode was immersed in 0.1 mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) sodium bicarbonate and submitted to continuous potential cycling from \\(-\\)1.3 to +1.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\) for 5 min. The activated electrodes were rinsed and placed in a solution containing 1 x 10\\({}^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) of the phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6. The deposition was carried out by dipping and by cycling the potential from 0.1 to +0.8 V at 50 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\) during a controlled time of 5 min. After both these processes, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with water and immersed in a solution containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The modified electrode exhibited a well-shaped cyclic voltammogram corresponding to the reversible oxidation of surface deposited only for caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid and stable current values were obtained only for the cycling method used for the deposition of diphenol compounds.\n\nSuprapur grade reagents supplied by Merck and demineralized water from a Milli-Q system (Milli-pore) were used in the preparation of all solutions. Acetate buffer used as a supporting electrolyte was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0.2 mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) acetic acid and sodium acetate solution. Ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic, chlorogenic and ascorbic acid stock solutions (1 x 10\\({}^{-2}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)) were prepared from the dry pure substances in water. An aliquot of the standard solution to be investigated was added by micropipette to 20 mL of deaerated acetate buffer pH 5.6, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAnalyses of caffeic acid and chlorogenic compounds in orange juice were carried out using three representative samples of natural juice commercialized in Brazil as Danone(r), Jussy(r) and Batavo(r). For comparison reasons, all samples examined were recently produced and stored at 10\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in obscurity and analyzed shortly after opening. An aliquot of 600 mL of the orange juice (without any previous dilution or extraction) was transferred directly into the voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The previous activated electrode was immersed in this solution and seven uninterrupted voltammetric curves were recorded between +0.1 and +0.8 V at 50 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\) when stable curves were obtained. Finally, the cyclic voltammograms were carried out after a step where the electrode was rinsed and placed in a voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The mean values of peak currents were obtained and the acids composition determined after standard addition method, when 1 x 10\\({}^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) of caffeic acid solution was added to the original sample and submitted to the deposition step, after which the voltammograms were recorded as shown above. All measurements were analyzed in triplicates.\n\n### Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH)\n\nThe free radical scavenging capacity of ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was also estimated from its ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 x 10\\({}^{-6}\\) to 1 x 10\\({}^{-4}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and _p_-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each \n\n## Page 5\n\nphenolic acid to reduce the absorbance of DPPH solution at 517 nm, followed on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer (Brand-Williams et al., 1995).\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\n### Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at a glassy carbon electrode\n\nCinnamic acid and its derivatives, ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic, contain reducible olefinic bond or oxidizible phenolic substituents on the aromatic ring that could provide the basis for their voltammetric determination. Nevertheless, only differential pulse voltammograms of 1 x 10-3 mol L-1 of cinnamic acid exhibit one cathodic peak in the pH range 3-7 at very negative potential (-1.5 V). The process is attributed to the reduction of the pre-protonated ethylene bond conjugated (H+[C6H5-CH]=CH-COOH) after two-electron transfer, as verified previously by polarographic studies (Ferreira et al., 1996). The inductive effects from _ortho_ and/or _para_ hydroxyl groups to the double bond, which is conjugated with the aromatic ring in the derivatives ferulic, _p_-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, make the molecule more difficult to reduce. Therefore, the cyclic voltammograms do not exhibit any voltammetric waves for reduction of phenolic derivatives on the useful potential range, and the methods do not demonstrate any analytical potentiality for their determination using the reduction of the olefinic bond in these compounds.\n\nOn the other hand, typical cyclic voltammograms obtained for all phenolic derivatives are shown in Fig. 2. Except cinnamic acid, which is not oxidized, all the derivatives present well-defined waves, and the shape and the peak potentials are characteristic of each compound.\n\nThe anodic oxidation of 1.0 x 10-3 mol L-1 caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have shown only one anodic peak at _E_pa = +0.36 V and _E_pa = +0.38 V, respectively. Linear plots of peak current (ipa) as a function of \\(v\\)1/2 were obtained indicating that both oxidation processes are diffusion controlled (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). For both compounds, a cathodic peak is observed on the reverse scan. Epc-Epa values obtained from the cyclic voltammograms (_v_ = 20 mV s-1) are around 30 mV suggesting a process involving two electrons (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The ratio of the anodic-to-cathodic peak heights (ipc/ipa) increases gradually from 0.8 to 1 with increasing potential sweep rate from 10 to 100 mV s-1 and the calculated current functions (ipa \\(\\cdot\\) _v_-1/2) diminish gradually with the potential scan rate, showing the classical behavior of an oxidation process coupled with a slow subsequent chemical reaction.\n\nIn order to establish their analytical potentiality, quantitative tests were developed for caffeic and chlorogenic acids using their anodic peaks by linear voltammetric scan. At pH 5.6, the analytical curves are linear from 1 x 10-4 to 1 x 10-3 mol L-1 and are described by the following regression lines: ip (mA) = 0.08138 + 2.1472 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.9993, \\(n\\) = 7) for caffeic acid and: ip (mA) = 0.05321 + 1.9571 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.995, \\(n\\) = 6 for chlorogenic acid. The reproducibility of the response was tested using a series of standard solutions of 5 x 10-4 mol L-1 caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Relative standard deviations of 2.4% and 2.8% were obtained, respectively.\n\nThe cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1.0 x 10-3 mol L-1 sinapic, ferulic and coumaric acids in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have also shown one anodic peak at _E_pa = +0.45 V, _E_pa = +0.53 V and \n\n## Page 6\n\n\\(E_{\\rm pa}=+0.73\\) V, respectively. The influence of scan rate on the cyclic voltammetric parameters was investigated from 0.01 to 3 V s\\({}^{-1}\\). The anodic peak appears to correspond to an irreversible process, as no current is observed in the reverse scan. The peak current is proportional to \\(v^{1/2}\\), indicating that the process is diffusion controlled. The current function decreased markedly up to a highest scan rate. These results suggest that the oxidation step is followed by an electron transfer coupled with a rapid chemical reaction (Bard and Faulkner, 1980).\n\nA linear relationship between peak current and sinapic acid and ferulic acid concentrations was obtained from \\(4\\times 10^{-4}\\) to \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) following the equation: ip (\\(\\mu\\)A) = \\(0.1302+0.602\\times 10^{3}\\) C (C = mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)); correlation coefficient 0.9089, \\(n=7\\) for sinapic acid and ip\n\nFigure 2: Cyclic voltammograms for the oxidation of \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) (buffer pH 5.6) of caffeic acid (a); sinapic acid (b); chlorogenic acid (c); ferulic acid (d); \\(p\\)-coumaric acid (e); and ascorbic acid (f) on glassy carbon electrode. Scan rate: 100 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n## Page 7\n\n(\\(\\mu\\)A) = 0.1034 + 0.837 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.9970, \\(n\\) = 7 for ferulic acid. A linear relationship was also obtained for coumaric acid from 4 x 10-5 to 1.2 x 10-3 mol L-1: ip (\\(\\mu\\)A) = 0.05705 + 1.0663 x 103 C (C = mol L-1); correlation coefficient 0.995, \\(n\\) = 7.\n\nIn agreement with the literature (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Baizer and Lund, 1972), the voltammetric behavior appears to agree with the global mechanism proposed for oxidation of phenol group in aromatic compounds (Baizer and Lund, 1972). The hydroxy groups are oxidized via two electrons transfer leading to the generation of a correspondent quinone after liberation of 2H+. The results have indicated that the higher the number of hydroxy substituents on the aromatic ring, the lower the electrochemical potential. Thus, _p_-coumaric acids (monophenols) have a higher potential than caffeic and chlorogenic acids (diphenyls). Such an order has already been defined by Peyrat-Maillard et al. (2000). In spite of the number of phenolic hydroxyls, the oxidation potential of caffeic and chlorogenic acids also presented a reversible redox couple that was not seen for the oxidation of the other phenolic compounds. The voltammetric behavior indicates that the oxidation process can involve the formation of a stable quinone which is reduced in the reverse scan, as observed in the oxidation of other phenolic compounds with the hydroxy group at the _ortho_ position (Baizer and Lund, 1972). In addition, the introduction of a quinic group on caffeic acid to give chlorogenic acid did not change the oxidation potential. However, the methoxylation of the phenolic groups (sinapic and ferulic acids) increases the peak potential and the rapid decomposition of the correspondent quinone makes the process appear to be an irreversible process since there is no reduction of quinone in the reverse scan.\n\nThe antioxidant activity of standard phenolic compounds is usually measured according to the method of Cuvelier et al. (1992) based on the accelerated autooxidation of methyl linoleate in anhydrous dodecane using strong oxidizing conditions or by spectrophotometric test measuring the antiradical capacity via reduction of the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (Brand-Williams et al., 1995) or by cyclic voltammetry (Chevion et al., 2000), in addition to several other available methods (Punchard, 1996).\n\nIn order to test the voltammetric results as a tool to evaluate the antioxidant capacity, the results were compared using the DPPH test (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and _p_-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each phenolic acid to reduce DPPH (see experimental section). Graphs of reduction of DDPH (%) as a function of different concentrations of phenolic compounds are shown in Fig. 3. The studied phenolic compounds showed free radical scavenging activity decreasing in the following sequence: caffeic acid > chlorogenic acid > sinapic acid > ferulic acid > coumaric acid. This behavior is attributed to the higher ability of diphenols to quench free radicals in solution by easier donation of hydrogen of hydroxy groups and to stabilize the respective radical forms due to electron delocalization.\n\nAs expected, the antioxidant or antiradical activity of most phenolic acids is inversely proportional to their oxidation potential. Diphenols (caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid) show high radical scavenging activities and low oxidation potentials when compared with other acids. Monophenols (_p_-coumaric acid) are less active and respond at a higher potential which is however smaller than those substituted by methoxy groups (sinapic and ferulic acids). In fact, the potential value is dependent upon the redox behavior of the compounds, reflecting their ability to lose electrons. The comparison is similar to that verified with DPPH measurement. Moreover, the \n\n## Page 8\n\nsignificant difference noticed for antioxidant activity for caffeic and chlorogenic acids is also confirmed by the shape of the voltammograms which indicates oxidation processes with reversible electron transfer.\n\nSo, the electrochemical oxidation could be used as a simple model to compare antioxidant activity based on the evaluation of the shape of the voltammogram and the oxidation potential.\n\n### Analysis of orange juice samples\n\nIn order to investigate the analytical potential of the electrochemical oxidation in determining phenolic derivatives in orange juice, cyclic voltammograms were recorded after a direct transfer of 100-3000 mL of natural orange juice samples to the voltammetric cell containing 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammogram, obtained as described in the experimental section, is shown in Fig. 4. A well-defined oxidation peak at \\(+\\) 0.38 V with 3.08 mA of anodic peak current (blank correction) is observed after transference of 600 mL of orange juice Danone(r), with peak heights proportional to the orange juice addition. Cyclic voltammograms recorded after standard addition of phenolic derivatives from \\(1\\times 10^{-4}\\) to \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) promote an extra peak at more positive values following the sequence: sinapic (70 mV), ferulic (150 mV) and _p_-coumaric (360 mV) acids indicating that they are probably not contributing significantly to the endogenous peak. Nevertheless, the standard addition of caffeic acid exhibited a concomitant increase in the peak current without any distortion of the peak potential. The same effect was observed with the standard addition of chlorogenic acid indicating that both contributions cannot be split.\n\nInterference of ascorbic acid was also tested under the same experimental conditions. Cyclic voltammograms obtained for \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) of ascorbic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 presents\n\nFig. 3: Free radical scavenging activity of phenolic acids towards DPPH after 30 min of chemical reaction: (a) caffeic acid, (b) chlorogenic acid, (c) sinapic acid, (d) ferulic acid and (e) _p_-coumaric acid. Measurements at \\(T=25^{\\circ}\\)C and \\(\\lambda=517\\) nm.\n\n\n\n## Page 9\n\nan irreversible oxidation peak at \\(\\,+\\,0.42\\,\\mathrm{V}\\), which was identified as potentially interfering in the analysis of phenolic compounds in orange juice, too. Similar results were obtained when the described method was applied to the determination of phenolic acids in commercial orange juice assigned as Batavo(r) and Jussy(r). The voltammograms obtained for \\(600\\,\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro L}\\) of orange juice in \\(10\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\) of acetate buffer pH 5.6 present oxidation peaks similar to those previously detected, with peak currents of \\(2.82\\pm 0.21\\) and \\(2.75\\pm 0.17\\,\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro A}\\) (values represent means of triplicate determinations), respectively. The peak height increases with standard addition of caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid or ascorbic acid, indicating value media of total phenolic compounds of \\(244.8\\pm 37\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) (\\(n=3\\)).\n\nSo, taking into consideration the fact that cyclic voltammetry could provide information about the total antioxidant capacity, without the specific determination of the contribution of each individual component, the method was tested using activated glassy carbon electrode.\n\n### Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at modified glassy carbon electrode\n\nAs described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997), glassy carbon electrode activated previously in bicarbonate solution can have its surface modified by active groups, where quinones, imidazoline groups and enzymes could be electrodeposited. Therefore, the analytical potentiality of the activated glassy carbon electrode obtained as described in the experimental section was investigated to determine phenolic compounds based on its interaction with the modified electrode.\n\nThe voltammetric response of glassy carbon electrode activated by continuous potential cycles from \\(-1.3\\) to \\(\\,+\\,1.6\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) at a sweep of \\(50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) (50 cycles) in sodium bicarbonate (\\(0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\)) solution does not exhibit any electroactive sites in the potential range from -0.4 to \\(\\,+\\,1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}\\). Two different deposition methods of phenolic compounds were employed. These methods involved dipping and cycling of the potential during the electrodeposition process.\n\n\n\n## Page 10\n\nIn the former method, the electrode was washed and transferred to a beaker containing \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6 solution. After carefully rinsing with water, the electrode was placed in a solution of \\(0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) acetate buffer previously purged with nitrogen. In the latter method, the activated electrode was rinsed and placed in a \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) solution of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6, where it was submitted to seven potential cyclings between \\(+\\,0.1\\) and \\(+\\,0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) (at \\(50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\)). The electrode was then removed to a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for both methods using caffeic acid were recorded at \\(100\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\). A redox couple of peaks at \\(+\\,0.33/+\\,0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) attributed to oxidation of phenol/quinone was observed for both methods, with characteristics close to those expected in a system involving surface process (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The voltammetric curves obtained using the cycling method present a higher peak intensity (Fig. 5). Successive scans (Curve n of Fig. 5) have shown constant values of current after the first scan indicating that the remaining material is quite persistent on the electrode surface. The results obtained using the dipping method have shown repetitive voltammograms with continuous decay during the continuous scanning of potential indicating that the material is released due to weak bound to the surface. So, the results obtained for both processes indicate that caffeic acid can be deposited on the electrode surface due to a weak interaction with the phenolic group (dipping) or strong interaction with quinone groups generated after successive oxidation (cycling). The most effective method was the electrodeposition of caffeic acid onto glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution using cycling potential and it was chosen as the best condition for analysis of the phenolic compounds.\n\nThe influence of cycling time from \\(+\\,0.1\\) to \\(+\\,0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) during accumulation of caffeic acid on the voltammetric response obtained for activated electrode was investigated immersing the previously\n\nFig. 5: Cyclic voltammograms obtained for oxidation of caffeic acid electrodeposited on glassy carbon modified electrode by electrochemical activation from \\(5\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) solution, rinsed and immersed in acetate buffer pH 5.6. \\(v=100\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\); (1) first scan, (n) multiple scan.\n\n\n\n## Page 11\n\nactivated electrode in \\(5\\times 10^{-4}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) caffeic acid and using cycling time from 50 s to 20 min. After a controlled time, the load electrode was removed to the voltammetric cell containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The current increased linearly up to 5 min of exposition, showing that the analyte is easily and rapidly accumulated on the electrode surface. At higher time, the current reaches a plateau indicating saturation of the electrode surface.\n\nIn order to assess the reproducibility of the electrode response, a series of 10 repetitive measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammograms (at 100 mV s\\({}^{-1}\\)) recorded for the activated electrode immersed in \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) caffeic acid solution and transported to a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The electrode response indicated a mean current peak value of \\(4.24\\pm 0.12\\) mA, where the coefficient of variation calculated was \\(4.3\\permille\\).\n\nUnder these experimental conditions, the calibration plots were tested immersing the coated electrode in caffeic acid solution containing \\(1\\times 10^{-4}-1\\times 10^{-3}\\) mol L\\({}^{-1}\\) using a controlled time of cycling of 5 min \n\n## Page 12\n\nacids. The cyclic voltammograms recorded after activated electrode transference to a voltammetric cell containing \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) of these phenolic compounds exhibit the expected behavior of that verified at bare electrode. But, when the electrode is rinsed and placed in a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6 there is no voltammetric signal, indicating that there is no remaining material on the activated electrode surface.\n\nThe electrodeposition mechanism of _o-_, _p_-quinones onto activated glassy carbon electrode has been described (Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997). The deposition of such compounds has been explained on the basis of a nucleophilic attack of quinones produced from the oxidation of phenolic compounds. When an activated glassy carbon electrode is used as a surface for electrooxidation of chlorogenic acid or caffeic acid, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the electrode act as nucleophiles against the _o_-quinone anodically formed. Such a process leads to bond formation and development of a stable modified electrode. The absence of _o_-hydroxyl substituents in the chemical structure or the irreversibility of the process observed during electrochemical oxidation, respectively, of _p_-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids, probably hinders this interaction or enhances the release rate from the surface and reduces the utility of activated glassy carbon electrode to pre-concentrate these phenolic compounds.\n\nSo, taking into consideration the selective interaction between activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic acid and/or chlorogenic compounds, without interference of ascorbic acid, the applicability of the method was tested in three different samples of orange juice. Quantification of the caffeic acid content in orange juice was accomplished by multiple standard additions of caffeic acid on activated glassy carbon electrode as described in the experimental section. Five milliliters of the orange juice was directly diluted in the voltammetric cell by adding it to \\(15\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\) of pH 5.6 acetate buffer. After 10 cycles between the potential of \\(+\\,0.1\\) and \\(+\\,0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}\\), the activated glassy carbon electrode was replaced in a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6 and characteristic cyclic voltammograms were obtained before and after the standard addition of caffeic acid. This method was also tested for aliquots of orange juice from 1.00 to \\(10.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\) and the peak current increases up to a dilution limit of \\(50\\%\\) in juice:buffer. The peak rise at \\(+\\,0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}\\) obtained in all voltammograms also increases with the amount of chlorogenic acid added as standard solution addition but has not shown any interference of _p_-coumaric, sinapic, ferulic or ascorbic acid, indicating that the modified electrode has shown high selectivity to caffeic acid or chlorogenic acid determination. The results obtained using the proposed method based on standard addition of caffeic acid are shown in Curves A and B of Fig. 7. The results obtained from the repetitions indicate that \\(2.42\\pm 0.28\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) of caffeic/chlorogenic acids are present in the Batavo orange juice samples. Danone(r) commercial orange juice presented \\(2.15\\pm 0.56\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) and Jussy(r), \\(1.85\\pm 0.39\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\), respectively. The results obtained using the proposed method are in agreement with the values provided by the literature (Robards and Antolovich, 1995) which indicate that caffeic and chlorogenic acids are the major cinnamic acid derivatives in orange juice and their usual concentrations are around \\(0.1\\)-\\(2\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\) in commercial orange juices.\n\n## 4 Conclusions\n\nFrom these studies, it was concluded that cyclic voltammetry is a rapid, simple and efficient instrumental tool for evaluating the antioxidant capacity of phenolic derivatives: ferulic, _p_\n\n## Page 13\n\ncoumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acid present in orange juice. The selective interaction of activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic or chlorogenic acid offers a good method for the detection and determination of these phenolic antioxidants in complex matrices like orange juice with a high degree of sensitivity without any pre-extraction step or interference of ascorbic acid, _p_-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic or cinnamic acids since they are not deposited on modified electrode surface.\n\n## References\n\n* Baizer and Lund (1972) Baizer, M.M., Lund, H., 1972.

Their effect on the electron transport chain on thylakoids was analyzed. Alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** inhibited ATP synthesis, basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled electron transport acting as fill reaction inhibitors on spinach chloroplasts. Alkaloid **3** was not active. The inhibition and interaction site of alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** on the non-cyclic electron transport chain was studied by polarography and fluorescence of the chlorophyll \\(a\\) (Chl _a_). The results indicate that the target for **1** was localized on the donor and acceptor side of PS II. In addition alkaloids **2** and **5** affect the PS I electron acceptors on leaf discs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere has been a growing recognition that many synthetic herbicides display a variety of adverse effects. In addition, it is becoming very difficult to discover new leads structures solely by synthetic means [1]. Therefore, modern strategies for discovering new agrochemical, i.e. insecticides, herbicides, etc. are focused on natural products, because they often have a reduced environmental impact, are biodegradable and may have new sites of interaction and specificity. In a program oriented towards the discovery of novel photosynthetic inhibitors, we identified diverse secondary metabolites such as chromenes, benzofurans, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, lactones, and terpenes from selected Mexican plants [2]. Furoquinoline alkaloids have attracted much interest due to their broad range of biological activities including various physiological and pharmacological activities [3,4]. In a previous work bioactive constituents from _Swinglea glutinosa_ (Rutaceae) [4, 5, 6, 7], and from _Hortic supra_ (Rutacea) were isolated and characterized. Quinolone alkaloids, flinderinge, N-methyl-flinderinge and acridone alkaloids inhibit the light reactions of photosynthesis [8]. The acridone alkaloids that contain 2,3,5,6-dehydro-4-oxopiperidine nucleus were the most active. As a contribution on the research of the Rutaceae family, in this work we report the isolation of five furoquinoline alkaloids: evolitrine (**1**), kokusaginine (**2**), _g_-fagarine (**3**), skimmingaline (**4**) and maculosidine (**5**) (Fig. 1) from a Brazilian tree _Balfourodendron_ _riedelianum_. The plant is used in the Brazilian folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments [9]. In the search for natural product that may have herbicide activity, we studied five furoquinoline alkaloids and found that four of them act as photosynthetic inhibitors. We investigated the mechanism of action of furoquinoline alkaloids **1**-**5 on the light reaction of photosynthesis and their possible targets on the electron transport chain on thylakoids and leaves discs. Among the techniques suitable for assessing the electron transport flow in the light reactions of photosynthesis on plants subjected to chemical stress, polarography (measuring oxygen evolution and using appropriate electron acceptors, donors and inhibitors) and fluorescence induction curves of chlorophyll \\(a\\) of photosystem II (PS II) were employed in the present work. Chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence data were analyzed by the \"JIP-test analysis\" [10].\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Tested material\n\nThe natural furoquinoline alkaloids: evolitrine (**1**), kokusaginine (**2**), _g_-fagarin (**3**), skimmingaline (**4**) and maculosidine (**5**) (Fig. 1)\n\n## Page 2\n\nwere isolated from _Balfourodendron riedelianum_ (Rutaceae) as previously published [11] and were assayed on the light reaction of photosynthesis in order to evaluate their activity. Stock solutions of **1-5** were prepared using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as solvent and its maximum concentration in the medium was less than 0.5%. Log \\(P\\) Parameters and Molar volume of the alkaloids were determined for each compound by the program Chem stech from www.ACD labs.com.\n\n### Purification and Isolation of the furoquinoline alkaloids (**1-5**)\n\nThe dichloromethane extract (2.1 g) obtained from the stem barks of _B. riedelianum_ was subjected to a counter current chromatography, in the RLCC (Rotation Locular Counter Chromatography, RLCC-1000, Eyela ceramic bomb VSP-3050) apparatus using chloroform/methanol/isopropanol/water (45:60:2:40), as stationary phase in an automatic collector (Eyea fraction collector DC-120). The apparatus loop was 3.0 mL to give a group of 24 fractions in a chloroform solution stationary phase (0.3626 g), which was subjected to a column over Sephadex LH-20 (430 mm x 30 mm, 300 g) and the elution was carried out with methanol (100%) to give 7 fractions. From the fraction 3 (0.0902 g) the alkaloid 3 was obtained and from the fraction 6 (0.0137 g) **1 and 2** were isolated, and the compound **4** was isolated from the fraction 5 (0.0437 g). These metabolites were identified by spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, including 2D experiments (HSQC and HMBC), the data were compared with previous report [12, 13, 14]. A solution of methanol/H2O (25%) of the methanol extract (58.6 g) obtained from the stem bark of _Balfourodendrum riedelianum_ and then subjected to a liquid extraction to get n-hexane (5.5 g), dichloromethane (26.4 g) and ethyl acetate (2.8 g) fractions. The dichloromethane fraction was subjected to a chromatographic column (silica flash, 47.0 x 5.5 cm). The gradient elution was carried out with hexane to methanol, giving eleven fractions. The fraction 9 (1.45 g) gave rise to a new chromatographic column (silica flash + florisil (1:1), 70.0 x 2.5 cm) with gradient of elution (hexane to methanol) providing seven fractions (I-VII). The fraction IV (0.95 g) was subjected to another silica flash/Florisil (1:1) column (71.0 x 2.5 cm, eluted with gradient of hexane - ethyl acetate), giving five new fractions (A-E). The fraction E (0.06 g) was subjected to a preparative thin-layer chromatography (20 x 20 cm, 1 mm), eluted with dichloromethane (100%) to isolate maculosidine (**5**) (0.02 g). This compound was identified with spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, as previously reported [12, 13, 14].\n\n### Chloroplasts isolation and chlorophyll determination\n\nIntact chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves (_Spinacea oleracea_ L) obtained from a local market as previously described [15, 16]. Chloroplasts were isolated with a medium that contained: 400 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and buffered with 3 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, then they were re-suspended in the same medium and stored as a concentrated suspension in the dark for 1 h at 0 degC.\n\n### Measurement of ATP synthesis\n\nTo measure ATP synthesis, intact chloroplasts (20 mg/mL of chlorophyll) were broken by osmotic rupture in the following low-buffered solution: 100 mM sorbitol, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM KCN, 50 mM methylviologen (MV) (as electron acceptor at FX level), 1 mM K+-tricine (pH 8.0), and 1 mM ADP, pH adjusted to 8.0 with KOH. The ATP synthesis was determined titrimetrically using a microelectrode Orion model 8103 Ross connected to a Corning potentiometer model 12, with expanded scale as previously reported [15, 17]. The linear rate of alkalization in the light was calibrated by back-titration with saturated HCl, the ATP formed was calculated as mmol ATP mg Chl-1 h-1.\n\n### Measurement of non-cyclic electron transport rate\n\nThe Light-induced non-cyclic electron transport activity from water to MV was determined with an oxygen monitors YSI (Yellow Springs Instrument) model 5300 using a Clark type electrode as previously published [15, 18].\n\nChloroplasts (equivalent of 20 mg/mL of chlorophyll) were freshly lysed in 3 mL of the basal electron transport reaction medium: 100 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KCN, 30 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, and 50 mM MV and measured the basal electron flow by polarography. Phosphoriding non-cyclic electron transport from water to MV was measured as basal non-cyclic electron transport medium except that 1 mM ADP and 3 mM KH2. PO4 were added to the reaction medium. Uncoupled electron transport from water to MV was tested as the basal non-cyclic electron transport, and 6 mM NH4Cl was added as uncoupler to the medium. All reaction mixture was illuminated for 1 min with an actinic light of a projector lamp (GAF 2660) passed through a 5 cm filter of CuSO4 at 2% w/v.\n\nFigure 1: Structures of the isolated furoquinoline alkaloids (**1–5**)\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n### Uncoupled photosystem II (PS II) and Uncoupled photosystem I (PS I) electron flow determination\n\nUncoupled PS II from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) [19] was monitored polarographically. DCBQ accepts electrons at the D1 protein, and thus we measured the electron transport from water to Qb. The reaction medium for assaying PS II activity was the same used for basal electron transport, except that MV was omitted and 1 mM 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBMIB), 100 mM DCBQ and 6 mM NH4Cl were added. Partial reaction of PS II electron transport from water to sodium siliconyldydate (SiMo) was determined as in PS II with the same basal electron transport medium without MV, and 50 mM SiMo and 10 mM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were added [20]. These electron flow activities were monitored with a yellow spring instrument (YSI) oxygen monitor, model 5300 using a Clark type electrode.\n\nUncoupled PS I electron transport was determined using the basal electron transport medium, plus 10 mM DCMU (to inhibit PSII at Qb level), 100 mM of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) were reduced with 300 mM ascorbate and uncoupled with 6 mM NH4Cl [21]. The 150 value for each activity was extrapolated using the graph of percentage of activity versus concentration of compounds. 150 is the concentration producing 50% inhibition of the activity.\n\n### Chlorophyll a fluorescence of PS II measurements in thylakoids\n\nChlorophyll a fluorescence transients were measured with a Handy-PEA (Plant Efficent Analyzer, from Hansatech, King's Lynn, Norfolk, UK) as previously described [16]. The maximum fluorescence yield from the sample was generated by illumination for 2 s with continuous light (650 nm peak wavelength, intensity equivalent of 2830 mmol photons m-2 s-1 and gain of 0.7.) provided by an array of three light-emitting diodes. The reaction medium used was that employed in basal non-cyclic electron transport measurements with MV. To monitor Chl \\(a\\) fluorescence transients, aliquots of dark-adapted thylakoids for 5 min containing 60 mg of Chl were transferred to filter paper by gravity with a dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, United States) in order to ensure a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of thylakoids. The filter paper was dipped immediately in 3 mL of the medium with different concentrations of the tested compounds, and the control contained medium plus the amount DMSO employed for each compound at the different used concentrations.\n\nChloroplasts infiltrated with 10 mM DCMU and chloroplasts previously treated with 0.8 M Tris ((hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane) were used as positive control. Chloroplasts were incubated with slight agitation for 30 min at 4 degC with 0.8 M Tris at pH 8.0 [22].\n\nThe OIIP transients were analyzed according to the JIP test and the measured parameters were: fluorescence intensity level (_F_o) when plastolquinone electron acceptor pool (QA) is fully oxidized and fluorescence level when QA is transiently fully reduced (_F_M), \\(F\\)1 is the fluorescence intensity level at 0.05 ms, \\(F\\)2 at 0.1 ms, \\(F\\)3 at 0.3 ms, \\(F\\)4 of \\(F\\)3 at 2 ms, \\(F\\)5 at 30 ms. Area is the area over the curve for between _F_o and _F_M, and relates the pool size of PS II electron transport acceptors [23]. From these parameters other derived parameters were calculated (Table 1) with the program BioJZF HP3 (from Laboratory University of Geneva; available at [http://www.unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen](http://www.unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen)). The fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) transients were normalized using the equation \\(V_{t} = (F_{t} - F_{0})/F_{M} - F_{0}), and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients is called \"relative variable fluorescence\", if plotted versus time revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band near to 2 ms, is an indication of the \\(Q_{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\) concentration is increased [10]. \\(V\\)0 is the relative variable fluorescence between _F_o and \\(F\\)1 and is calculated as \\(V_{\\text{of}}(t) = \\text{FV}t/(F_{f} - F_{0}) = (F_{t} - F_{0})/(F_{f} - F_{0})\\) and plotted versus time. If a K-band appeared near to 0.3 ms indicate a damaged in the water splitting system on thylakoids [10].\n\n### Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements in spinach leaf discs\n\nChlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence on discs from dark-adapted spinach leaf was measured with the same equipment and conditions used for thylakoids. Fifteen spinach leaf discs (7 mm diameter) were placed in each Petri dishes with 10 mL of modified Krebs solution which contained: 115 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM Na2SO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 25 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4), then were incubated for 4 h at room temperature, after this time, different concentrations of compound was added to each Petri dish. The leaf discs were incubated for 4 h more in the presence of the compounds, then, they were dark adapted for 30 min and afterwards the fluorescence of the chlorophyll \\(a\\) was measured. The same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used for the samples treated with the analyzed compounds was added to the control samples for eliminating the solvent effect.\n\n### Plant material for in vivo assays\n\nThe seeds of _Physalis ioxocarpa_ and _Lolium perenne_, a weed species, were sown in 12 cm diameter pots and were watered daily in the greenhouse at 25-30 degC. After 15 and 18 days of emergence for _P. ioxocarpa_ and _L. perenne_, respectively, the plants were selected for similar size and were sprayed manually with the compounds **1** and **2** at concentrations of 150 and 300 mM. A stock of 20 mM of each compound was prepared in DMSO and an aliquot of this solution was taken to obtain the desired concentration in an aqueous suspension containing 0.05% w/v of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The control group was sprayed with distilled water containing the same amount of DMSO and Tween-20.\n\n### Chlorophyll a fluorescence determination in intact leaves in vivo\n\nThis was performed at room temperature with a portable Handy PEA apparatus [11] in the leaves of dark adapted-plants for 15 min both on the control and on the treated plants after 24, 40 and 72 h of being sprayed with the compounds.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Inhibition of ATP synthesis\n\nTo know the effect of the fluoroquinoline alkaloids **1**-**5** on photophosphorylation, they were assayed on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts. ATP synthesis was inhibited by **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The 150 values for this activity were 83.5 and 59.0 mM for **1** and **2**, respectively; **4** and **5** had the same value 50.5 mM and **3** was almost inactive and it was not further studied (Fig. 2).\n\n### Effect of the natural fluoroquinoline alkaloids on chloroplast electron transport rate\n\nThe light-dependent photophosphorylation is coupled to electron transport rate and can be inhibited by different ways: by blocking the electron transport, by direct inhibition of the H*-ATP-ase, or by uncoupling the ATP synthesis process from the electron transport [24]. To elucidate the mechanism of action of the fluoroquinoline alkaloids on photosynthesis, their effects on non- cyclic electron transport (basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled) from water to MV were investigated.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\nFuroquinoline alkaloids **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled electron transport as their concentrations increased up to 200 uM. The 150 values for uncoupled electron transport rate were 21.0, 18.6, 23.4 and 22.8 uM, respectively (Table 2). Compounds **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited the electron flow (in basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions) and ATP synthesis; therefore they act as Hill reaction inhibitors. Other natural products that act as Hill reaction inhibitors are the bifluoranoid isolated from _Seleginella leptohydylla_, robustflavone [25] or the furanoditerpene canophyllol isolated from _Celastrus vulcanicolo_) [16].\n\nLocalization of furoquinoline alkaloids interaction sites on the light reaction of photosystem PS II and photosystem PS I and partial reactions\n\nTo localize the inhibition site of the alkaloids on the thylakoid electron transport chain, their effects on PS II, PS I and photosystems partial reactions were tested using artificial electron donors and acceptors, as well as appropriate inhibitors [21]. Table 3 shows that **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited the uncoupled PS II electron flow from water to DCBQ; **1** inhibited PS II 100% at a concentration of 300 uM, however, alkaloids **2, 4** and **5** inhibited partially this activity (81%, 67% and 89%, respectively) at the same concentration (300 uM); therefore, **1** was the most active compound inhibiting the PS II electron transport. To further localize the inhibition site of the furoquinolines on the PS II electron transport chain, their effects were measured on the electron flow from water to SiOto (SiMo accepts electrons from phenophyrin, so in this way the electron flow measurements are from the water splitting enzyme to phenophyrin). The results indicate that **1, 2, 4** and **5** did not affect this partial reaction, since the rate of treated thylakoids were similar to the control (data not shown), therefore, all active fluoroquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electron transport chain beyond the phenophyrin site [20]. The polarographic measurements suggest that **1, 2, 4** and **5** inhibited electron transport between _Q_A and _Q_B of PS II, at the D1 protein by displacing _Q_B, similar to how DCMU herbicide acts. The mechanism action of **1, 2, 4** and **5** is similar to other natural products like trachydiban-19-oic acid [26], flindersine [4].\n\nUncoupled PS I electron transport rate was measured by polarography from reduced DCIPIP to MV by using increasing concentrations of the alkaloids tested, in order to find if they affect this photosystem. The results of these studies showed that the rate for control and treated samples were similar, therefore the furoquinoline alkaloids do not interact with PS I electron transport chain (data not shown).\n\nMeasurements of the Chl a fluorescence transient in thylakoids in the presence of the furoquinoline alkaloids\n\nTo corroborate the polarography results about the interaction site of the furoquinoline alkaloids at PS II, fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) were measured on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts incubated for 5 min in the dark at room temperature. Control chloroplast contained the amount of DMSO used for each treatment, the treated chloroplasts contained various concentrations of the compounds (each concentration was measured three times): chloroplasts incubated with Tris and 10 uM DCMU were used as positive control (Fig. 3). Chlorophyll \\(a\\) induction curves of thylakoids control (Fig. 3) showed an OJIP sequence similar to that previously described for plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria [27] except that phase IP was in part suppressed due to the effect of MV [28]. The chloroplasts infiltrated with DCMU and the control samples showed almost identical _F_M level (Table 4). However, the _F_M level of treated chloroplasts decreased respect to the control, while the _F_o was not been affected by almost all the compounds tested; only **1** increased lightly the _F_o level. The fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) transients were normalized, and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band (Fig. 4A). The fluorescence rise to the J-band provides information\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Fluorescence parameters derived from the extracted data \\\\ _M_\\({}_{\\bullet} \\times (F_{{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}_{{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}{\\text{0}}}}-F_{{\\text{0}}})(F_{{\\text{M}}}-F_{{\\text{0}}})\\) & Approximated initial slope (in ms−1) of the fluorescence transient _V_\\({}_{\\bullet}\\) = _f_(_t_) \\\\ Sm = (_A_(_F_)/(_F_M_ - _F_) \\\\ Yields of flux ratios \\\\ _ρ_\\text{P_{0}} = TR/_μ_/_\n\n## Page 5\n\nabout single turnover events of the primary reactions of the photochemistry, mainly \\(Q_{\\rm A}\\) reduction, indicating that the electron transport beyond \\(Q_{\\rm A}\\) is blocked at the \\(Q_{\\rm B}\\) level as DCMU does, suggesting that 1 interacts at this site and the unused energy is dissipated as heat [10]. In Fig. 4A, a small H-band was observed after 100 ms and closer to 1000 ms, this band is due to the electron acceptor MV effect [28]. In Fig. 4B, a K-band is observed in chloroplasts treated with Tris 0.8 M. Even though a small K-band is also observable in chloroplasts treated with DCMU, this band can be to the solvent effect of the ethanol where the DCMU was dissolved [28], however, the fluoroquinoline alkaloids were dissolved in DMSO as solvent and it have not any effect on the fluorescence induction curve.\n\nFurthermore, the \\(F_{m}\\) value in the presence of DCMU plus MV is similar to the control sample (Table 4). In chloroplasts treated with fluoroquinolines alkaloids plus MV decreased Fm and the parameters derived from the JIP test (see Table 1) had similar behavior with DCMU treatment (Fig. 5), with the parameter \\(\\delta\\)R\\({}_{0}\\) exception, [it reflects the efficiency with which an electron can move from the reduced electron acceptors coming of the intersystem to the PS I (reducing site) [29]; this parameter was slightly increased by the fluoroquinoline treatments (with DCMU treatment it drastically diminished). Values like RE\\({}_{\\rm a}\\)/CS, RE\\({}_{\\rm e}\\)/RC and \\(\\varphi_{\\rm Ro}\\) decreased with all treatments, being more drastic for DCMU. These results suggest that the fluoroquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electrons transport chain in two sites, one at donor and the other on the acceptor side in PS II (Fig. 5). The effect of fluoroquinoline alkaloids site at the donor side was detected only by the technique of fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) of PS II, and not by polarography technique [10].\n\n### Measurements of the Chl a fluorescence transient in leaf discs\n\nTo know if the alkaloids can reach their targets on the photosynthesis electron transport chain, fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) induction curves were measured in discs obtained from fresh spinach leaves. In Fig. 6A the DJIP sequences for control and discs treated with the most active fluoroquinoline **1** (in this case MV was omitted from the medium) showed a rise in the J peak. In discs treated with **1, 2**, and **5**** at concentration of 400 \\(\\mu\\)M, the differences between normalized curves and control showed a J-band (Fig. 6B). Furthermore **4** did not show any effect on the discs fluorescence (data not shown). J-band for **1** was bigger than for **2** and **5** (Fig. 6B). Also **1** and **2** showed a small K-band while compound **5** lacks this band (Fig. 6C). When the transients were normalized between \\(F_{M}\\) and \\(F_{5}\\), a band in the IP region appeared (30 ms to about 300 ms) for compounds **2** and **5** (Fig. 6D). Corroborating with the derived parameters from the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline Compounds & Basal & Phosphorylating & Uncoupled \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 25.0 ± 2 & 37.5 ± 2.3 & 21.0 ± 2 \\\\\n2 & 10.0 ± 4 & 10.0 ± 4 & 18.6 ± 1.35 \\\\\n4 & 29.5 ± 1.1 & 32.3 ± 1.33 & 23.4 ± 1.37 \\\\\n5 & 50.0 ± 3 & 42.6 ± 1.25 & 22.8 ± 1.66 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Iso values (μM) of **1, 2, 4, and 5** obtained from basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled electron transport rate from water to MV in spinach chloroplasts.

In addition, the quantum yield for the reduction of PSI end acceptors per photon absorbed also increased. These results suggest that end acceptors of PS I cannot be reduced because the electrons from PS II are not available. The parameters for **2** and **5** are similar to the control (Fig. 7) indicating that these compounds do not reach completely their target.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \\hline  & \\(F_{\\rm\n\n## Page 7\n\n\n\n### _In vivo assays_\n\nIn order to confirm if **1** can penetrate the intact whole leaf and affect the plants in vivo, this compound was sprayed on the leaves of _L. perenne_ and _P. ivocarpa_ plants after 15 days of growth in the green house. Studies of chlorophyll \\(a\\) Fluorescence were performed on the plants after 24, 48 and 72 h of being sprayed with **1** at 150 and 300 uM. The results showed non-significant inhibiting growth effect. These results suggest that **1** does not overcome the natural barriers provided by the plants, since the chlorophyll \\(a\\) and dry biomass of these plants were not affected by **1** (data not shown).\n\n## 4 Conclusions\n\nThe results indicated that fluoroquinoline alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** inhibited ATP synthesis and electron transport in spinach chloroplasts while **3** was inactive. The inhibition site of alkaloids **1**, **2**, **4** and **5** was located at the acceptor side of PS II by polarographic technique. When these results were corroborated by chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence of PS II data; we found that the donor side of PSII is inhibited by these fluoroquinoline alkaloids. Chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence measurements on leaf discs treated with fluoroquinoline alkaloids showed changes in the induction curve of fluorescence only with **1**, transforming the QIIP trace at OJ step, showing a J band which indicates that only **1** can reach its inhibition target. However when **1** was sprayed on intact whole leaves, this compound could not penetrate the leaves plant natural barriers. Furthermore, **1** with two methoxy groups has the lowest molar volume unlike compounds **2**, **4** and **5** with 3 methoxy groups and therefore larger molar volumes which make more difficult their translocation in the leaves. Also alkaloid **3** has a lower molar volume, but it has a log_P_ value of 2.70, similar to compounds **4** and **5**. However, **1** has a high- or log_P_ value of 3.20 suggesting that this compound fulfills the specific structure requirements for inhibiting PSII electron transport chain in leaf discs that the other fluoroquinoline alkaloids studied lack these characteristics.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from DGAPA-UNAM grants PAPIT number IT102012-3 and PAIP number\n\nFig. 6: (A) Chlorophyll \\(a\\) fluorescence (QIIP) transients of dark-adapted spinach leaf discs treated with 400 μM of fluoroquinoline **1** (•) and control (•), (B), (D) and (C) show the normalized relative variable fluorescence of chlorophyll \\(a\\) obtained with leaf discs infiltrated with 400 μM of **1** (•), **2** (•) and **5** (•).

Mez. showed moderate antifungal activity against _Cidasopporum sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladasoporioides_, triggering further studies. The crude EtOAc extract afforded two new benzopyran derivatives (**2** and **4**) and the known compounds **1** and **3**, which were tested in cell proliferation and antifungal assays. Compound **2** caused a potent proliferative stimulus to two mammalian cell lines and a weak antifungal activity. The dualistic activities described in this study (stimulatory mammalian cell proliferation and antifungal) might be of special interest in what concerns to species specificity action.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe known compounds 2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (**1**) and (2_R_)-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (**3**), were identified by comparing their physical and spectroscopic data with literature values (Nagasawa et al., 1988; Wu et al., 1999). A positive optical rotation displayed by compound **3**, further allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-2 as \\(R\\).\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C12H13O4 ([M + H]+ at _m/z_ 221.0917). Analysis of the NMR, IR and UV spectra, suggested the presence of a chromane derivative (Saengchantara and Wallace, 1990). The 1H NMR spectrum of **2** (Table 1) showed a signal at \\(d\\) 12.70 (1H, _s_) attributed to a chelated phenolic OH. Spin-systems corresponding to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring and a 2-hydroxypropyl group were also observed, along with an isolated olefin proton signal. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals (Table 1) consistent with these units and with the presence of a carbonyl group. The 13C NMR chemical shifts indicated that the benzene ring is 1,3-dioxygenated and that the carbonyl group is part of a benzopyran unit. Data from the _g_HMBC experiment (Table 1) supported these conclusions and enabled completion of structure **2**. For example, correlations of the H-1a' proton with olefinic carbons C-2 and C-3 enabled location at the 2-hydroxypropyl group at C-2. In addition, the selected irradiation 1D-NOESY experiment was conducted on H-3 and showed NOE correlations with H-1a' and H-2'. The absolute configuration of analogue (2'S)-7-hydroxy-2-(2'-hydropropyl)-5-methyl-chromone has been determined as \\(S\\) (Kashiwada et al., 1984) and showed a positive optical rotation. Since **2** also exhibited positive specific rotation, C-2' was assigned the _sinister_ configuration. Based on these and other data and \\(d\\) values, the structure of **2** was defined as (2'S)-2-(propan-2'-ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. Its HRESI mass spectrum exhibited a [M - H2O + H]+ at _m/z_ 163.0757 corresponding to a molecular formula C10H11O2. The absence of a carbonyl band in the IR spectrum suggested reduction at this position relative to **3**. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) revealed the presence of the same 1,3-dioxygenated; 1,2,3-trisubstituted aromatic system for **2** along with a spin-system corresponding to the C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-1' portion of structure **4**. The equatorial and axial orientations of H-4, H-2, H-3 and H-1' were\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} Position & **2** & **4** \\\\\n1H (Δ) & 13C (Δ) & _g_HMBC & NOESY & 1H (Δ) & 13C (Δ) & _g_HMBC \\\\\n2 & – & 170.0 & – & – & _α_4.24 \\(m\\) & 66.6 & C-9 \\\\\n3 & 6.32 \\(s\\) & 109.5 & C-1′, C-10 & H-1′a, H-2′ & _α_1.50 _ddd_ (14.7, 14.7, 4.0) & 38.0 & – \\\\  & & – & – & _α_71.88 _ddd_ (14.7, 4.0, 4.0) & – \\\\\n4 & – & 182.0 & – & – & _α_74.72 _br s_ & 57.1 & C-10 \\\\\n5 & – & 159.9 & – & – & – & 156.8 & – \\\\\n6 & 6.79 \\(d\\) (8.0) & 110.7 & C-10 & – & 6.20 _dd_ (8.0, 1.0) & 106.9 & – \\\\\n7 & 7.63 \\(t\\) (8.0) & 135.6 & C-5, C-9 & – & 6.92 \\(t\\) (8.0) & 128.7 & – \\\\\n8 & 7.03 \\(d\\) (8.0) & 107.3 & C-10 & – & 6.33 _dd_ (8.0, 1.0) & 106.5 & – \\\\\n9 & – & 156.3 & – & – & – & 156.0 & – \\\\\n10 & – & 109.9 & – & – & – & 112.4 & – \\\\\n1′_a_ & 2.68 \\(d\\) (8.5) & 43.5 & C-2, C-3 & H-3 & _α_71.32 \\(d\\) (6.0) & 21.2 & C-2, C-3 \\\\\n1′_b_ & 2.76 \\(d\\) (4.5) & – & – & – & – & – \\\\\n2′ & 4.10 \\(m\\) & 64.2 & – & H-3 & – & – & – \\\\\n3′ & 1.18 \\(d\\) (6.0) & 23.4 & C-1′ & – & – & – & – \\\\\n5-OH & 12.70 s & – & – & – & – & – & – \\\\\n2′-OH & 4.92 \\(d\\) (4.5) & – & – & – & – & – & – \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectroscopic data for compounds **2** and **4** in DMSO-_d_a\n\n## Page 3\n\ndeduced from their coupling constants. Small _J_-values showed by H-4 suggested _vicinal eq-eq_ and _eq-ax_ couplings with H2-3. The H-3_eq_ showed constants that suggested a _vicinal_ coupling _eq-eq_ (4.0 Hz) with H-2 and _eq-ax_ (4.0 Hz) with H-4 and a _geminal_ coupling (14.7 Hz) with H-3_ax_. The 14.7, 14.7 and 4.0 Hz _J_-values for H-3_ax_ indicated a _geminal_ coupling, a _vicinal ax-ax_ coupling with H-2 and an _ax-eq_ coupling with H-4, respectively. Based on the conformational preference of methyl group over hydroxyl, the methyl group at C-2 was assumed to be in an equatorial position on a half-chair ring, which is the preferred conformation for benzopyrans (Joshi and Merchant, 1984). Therefore, due to equatorial position determined for H-4, compound **4** was characterized as the _trans_-isomer at H-4-H-2. All NMR signals were assigned by analysis of _g_HMQC and _g_HMBC experiments (Table 1) and \\(d\\) values. Compound **4** was thus identified as the previously unreported 2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-benzopyran-4,5-diol.\n\nCompounds **1**-**4** (see Scheme 1) were evaluated against _Cladosporium phaerosgpermann_ and _C. cladosporiides_ using direct bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds **1** and **2** exhibited a weak antifungal activity, showing a detection limit of 10 mg for both substances. Compound **3** and **4** did not show any antifungal activity. Nystatin was employed as a positive control showing a detection limit of 1 mg. The reduction at \\(\\Delta^{2,3}\\) in **3**, changing the conformation of the pyrane ring, may be the cause of the loss of the activity.\n\nBiological evaluation of **1**-**4** was also carried out using HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines. Compound **2**, at 20 mmol/L was able to induce 70% increase in cell proliferation to HeLa and 25% to CHO cells, when compared to the DMSO treated cells. The compounds **1**, **3** and **4** were inactive in CHO and displayed a weak stimulatory effect in HeLa cells. When cisplatin, a well known antineoplastic agent, was used as a control, a clear inhibition of cell proliferation was observed.\n\nThe biological activity of **1** and **2** seems to be differentially specific to fungi or mammalian cells, and also to different mammalian cell lines. The indication of a possible specific mechanism of action is of great interest and deserves further investigation.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedure\n\nOptical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 degC. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Nicolet Impact-400 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as an internal standard. HRESI mass spectra were obtained on an Autospec-Micromass mass spectrometer. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) preparative column.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _O. corymbosa_ plant material was collected in \"Estacao Experimental de Araraquara\", Araraquara, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2001. The botanical identification was made by Professor Maria Claudia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No MCMY-1314).\n\n### Isolation of the endophytic fungus\n\nFor the isolation of the endophytic fungus, adult and healthy leaves were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were first washed with water and soap, and immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and finally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 x 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate\n\n## Page 4\n\n(50 mg/mL) with approximately three to four pieces on each dish. The material was incubated at 25 degC for 10 days and the endophyte _Curvularia_ sp. was isolated by replication and preserved in sterile water (Maier et al., 1997). The fungus was identified by Dr. Jose Odair Pereira (UFA) and deposited in NuBBE's collection with culture number \"PAJ-04\".\n\n### Growth of Curvularia and production of the EIOAc extract\n\nThe fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 degC for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 x 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the _Curvularia_ isolated were inoculated into each flask and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 degC on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration, and the filtrate was partitioned with ethyl acetate (3 x 200 mL). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase in vacuo yielded a brown solid residue (158 mg). After this extract was found to display bioactivity, this process was scaled up using 4.0 L of PDB (20 Erlenmeyer flasks) and afforded 1.8 g of EtoAc extract.\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\nThe microorganisms _C. cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and _C. sphaerospermum_ (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. The compounds 1-4 were applied on a pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 mg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control.\n\n### Determination of cell viability after treatment with benzopyrans\n\nHeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were cultured at 37 degC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Penicillin (100 mg/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) were included in medium to prevent bacterial growth. A stock solution (20 mmol/L) was prepared by dissolving compounds 1-4 in DMSO (vehicle). The final concentrations (200, 20 and 2 mmol/L) were achieved by direct dilution into the cell medium. Cells were plated (104 cells/well) in a 48-well tray 24 h prior to the beginning of the experiment. After addition of the compound or the vehicle, cells were analyzed after a period of 48 h using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983; Rubinstein et al., 1990).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe EtoAc extract (1.8 g) was fractionated by column chromatography (CC) using reversed-phase silica gel (ODS) and eluted with a MeOH-H2O gradient (1:9 100% MeOH) affording 8 fractions (A-H). Fraction A (125 mg) was further purified using reverse phase prep. HPLC [_l_ = 221 nm, 12.0 mL/ min., CH3CN:H2O (2:8)] affording **1** (2.2 mg) and **2** (1.8 mg). Fraction B (100 mg) was also purified using reversed phase prep. HPLC [_l_ = 230 nm, 12.0 mL/min., CH3CN:H2O (23:77)], affording **3** (10.2 mg) and finally fraction C (770 mg) was also submitted to reverse phase prep. HPLC, [_l_ = 221 nm, 12.0 mL/min., CH3CN:H2O (37:63)] to afford compound **4** (2.7 mg).\n\n#### 3.7.1 (2'S)-2-(propan-2'-ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one (2)\n\nAmorphous powder (1.8 mg); [_a_]D +30 (_c_ 0.25, MeOH); UV _l_max (CH3OH) nm (log _e_): 240 (4.0); IR _v_max (KBr) cm-1 : 3732, 1629, 1030.

Their chemical structures were assigned based on analyses of MS, 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopic experiments. Biological analyses were performed using two mammalian cell lines, human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO). The results showed that compound **1** had no effect when compared to the control group, which was treated with the vehicle (DMSO). Compound **2** was able to induce a slight increase in cell proliferation of HeLa (37% of increase) and CHO (38% of increase) cell lines. Analysis of compound **3** showed that it has potent cytotoxic activity against both cell lines, with an IC50 of 8.0 uM. Biological analyses using the phytopathogenic fungi _Cladosporium sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ revealed that also **2** showed potent antifungal activity compared to nystatin.\n\nkeywords: _Periconia atropurpurea_; Endophytic fungi; Coumarin; Benzaldehyde; Antifungal; Cell proliferation +\nFootnote †: journal: Nuclear Medicine\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThis study was conducted as part of our ongoing bioprosting program biota-FAPESP, that aims to discover potential antitumor, antifungal and antioxidant agents produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado. Among sixty screened fungi, _Periconia atropurpurea_, isolated from the leaves of _Xylopia aromatica_, was chosen for detailed chemical investigation due to its antifungal activity against _Cladosporium sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_, i.e. as demonstrated by the ethyl acetate extract which in turn led to isolation of two new compounds: 6,8-dimethoxy-3-(2'-oxo-propyl)-coumarin (**1**) and 2,4-dihydroxy-6-[(1'_E_,3'_E_)-penta-1',3'-dienyl]-benzaldehyde (**2**), as well as the known compound periconicin B (**3**) (Kin et al., 2004). In this paper, we report the isolation, structure elucidation and biological evaluation of compounds **1-3** using two mammalian cell lines, human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), as well as two phytopathogenic fungi, _Cladosporium sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe known compound periconicin B (**3**) was identified by comparing its physical and spectroscopic data with literature values (Kin et al., 2004). It was described for the first time from the fungus _Periconia_ sp., and has not been reported from any another fungal source.\n\nThe new compound 6,8-dimethoxy-3-(2'-oxo-propyl)-coumarin (**1**), was obtained as a brown amorphous powder and had a molecular formula of C14H14O5, as revealed by analysis of the positive ion HRESI-MS data. The UV spectra showed four bands at 215, 231 (sh), 249 (sh) and 287 nm, with the latter being typical of an aromatic chromophore. The IR spectrum had bands at 1740 and 1630 cm-1, suggesting conjugated carboxyl and carbonyl groups, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **1**, two methoxy moieties were identified by observation of signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.80 (3H, \\(s\\), 6-OCH3) and \\(\\delta\\) 3.89 (3H, \\(s\\), 8-OCH3). A spin-system corresponding to a 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring was also assigned on the basis of the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 6.76 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-5) and \\(\\delta\\) 6.86 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-7). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum displayed an isolated olefinic hydrogen signal at \\(\\delta\\) 7.80 (1H, \\(s\\), H-4) and resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 3.68 (2H, \\(s\\), H-1') and \\(\\delta\\) 2.19 (3H, \\(s\\), H-3') attributable to a 2'-oxo-propyl group. These data were consistent with the corresponding 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) and with similar information from analogues published in the literature (Dittmer et al., 2005), which suggested that **1** could possess a coumarin skeleton. This was inferred by signals at \\(\\delta\\) 142.1 (C-4), \\(\\delta\\) 100.0 (C-5), \\(\\delta\\) 102.9 (C-7) and \\(\\delta\\) 119.6 (C-10) observed in the 13C NMR spectrum, and additional resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 161.0 (C-2), \\(\\delta\\) 125.0 (C-3), \\(\\delta\\) 156.0 (C-6), \\(\\delta\\) 147.0 (C-8) and \\(\\delta\\) 139.0 (C-9) observed in the _g_HMBC spectrum. In addition, two signals at \\(\\delta\\) 55.7 (6-OCH3) and \\(\\delta\\) 56.5 (8-OCH3), and three at \\(\\delta\\) 44.2 (C-1'), \\(\\delta\\) 205.0 (C-2') and \\(\\delta\\) 29.6 (C-3') were observed and attributable to methoxy and oxo-propyl groups, respectively. Data from the _g_HMBC and NOESY experiments (Table 1) supported these conclusions and enabled completion of the structure of **1**. Correlations of the H-1' protons with olefin (C-4) and carboxyl (C-2) carbons supported the location of a 2'-oxo-propyl group at C-3. NOESY experiments were conducted on all hydrogens of **1** and showed a NOE correlation between 6-OCH3/H-5, H-5/H-4, H-4/H-1', H-1'/H-3' and H-7/8-OCH3 thereby confirming unambiguously\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c} Position & **1** & & & **2** & & & & \\\\ \\cline{2-9}  & \\({}^{1}\\)H (\\(\\delta\\)) & \\({}^{13}\\)C (\\(\\delta\\)) & _g_HMBC & NOESY & \\({}^{1}\\)H (\\(\\delta\\)) & \\({}^{13}\\)C (\\(\\delta\\)) & _g_HMBC & NOESY \\\\ \\hline\n1 & & & & & & & & \\\\\n2 & & 161.0 \\({}^{\\text{b}}\\) & & & & & 111.2 & & \\\\\n3 & & 125.0 \\({}^{\\text{b}}\\) & & & & & 165.3 & & \\\\\n4 & 7.80 \\(s\\) & 142.1 & C-9 & H-5, H-1′ & & & 165.1 & & \\\\\n5 & 6.76 \\(d\\) (2.5) & 100.0 & – & H-4, 6-OCH3 & 6.49 \\(d\\) (2.5) & 105.8 & C-3, C-4, C-6, C-1′ & H-2′ \\\\\n6 & & 156.0 \\({}^{\\text{b}}\\) & & & & & 143.7 & & \\\\\n7 & 6.87 \\(d\\) (2.5) & 102.9 & C-9 & 8-OCH3 & & & & \\\\\n8 & & 147.0 \\({}^{\\text{b}}\\) & & & & & & \\\\\n9 & & 139.0 \\({}^{\\text{b}}\\) & & & & & & \\\\\n10 & & 119.6 & & & & & & \\\\\n1′ & 3.68 \\(s\\) & 44.2 & C-2′, C-2, C-4 & H-4, H-3′ & 7.16 \\(d\\) (15.5) & 124.8 & C-5, C-6, C-3′ & 1-COH, H-3′ \\\\\n2′ & & 205.0 \\({}^{\\text{b}}\\) & & 6.71 _dd_ (10.5, 15.5) & 134.0 & C-6, C-4′ & H-5, H-4′ \\\\\n3′ & 2.19 \\(s\\) & 29.6 & C-2′ & H-1′ & 6.27 _ddd_ (0.5, 10.5, 15.0) & 131.7 & – & – \\\\\n4′ & & & & & 5.95 _dq_ (6.5, 15,0) & 132.3 & C-2′, C-5′ & H-2′, H-5′ \\\\\n5′ & & & & & 1.80 _dd_ (0.5, 6.5) & 18.1 & C-3′ & H-4′ \\\\\n1-COH & & & & & 10.10 \\(s\\) & 192.3 & C-1, C-2, C-6 & H-1′ \\\\\n6-OCH3 & 3.80 \\(s\\) & 55.7 & C-6 & H-5 & & & \\\\\n8-OCH3 & 3.89 \\(s\\) & 56.5 & C-8 & H-7 & & & \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\({}^{\\text{a}}\\) Chemical shifts (relative to TMS) are in (\\(\\delta\\)) ppm, coupling constants in Hz in parentheses.

The UV spectra showed bands at 261, 294 and 339 nm, assuring the presence of an aromatic ring. The IR spectrum had bands at 3470 and 1629 cm-1 accounting for the aromatic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** displayed a signal at \\(d\\) 10.10 (1H, \\(s\\), 1-CO_H_) attributable to an aldehyde group. The spin-system corresponding to a tetra-substituted benzene ring was identical to that obtained for **1** and was observed at \\(d\\) 6.18 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-3) and \\(d\\) 6.49 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-5). The spectrum also displayed four resonances at \\(d\\) 7.16 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 15.5 Hz, H-1'), \\(d\\) 6.71 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 10.5, 15.5 Hz, H-2'), \\(d\\) 6.27 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 0.5, 10.5, 15.0 Hz, H-3') and \\(d\\) 5.95 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 15.0 Hz, H-4') attributable to olefinic hydrogens in an _S-trans_ arrangement, suggesting the presence of a conjugated diene with a _trans_/_trans_ configuration (_E_/_E_). In addition, a signal at \\(d\\) 1.80 (3H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 0.5, 6.5 Hz, H-5') was attributable to a vinyl methyl moiety in a _vicinal_ coupling with H-4' and allylic coupling with H-3'. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals (Table 1), including one for the aldehyde group at \\(d\\) 192.3 (1-COH). The penta-1',3'-dienyl moiety was confirmed by assignment of the carbon resonances at \\(d\\) 124.8 (C-1'), \\(d\\) 134.0 (C-2'), \\(d\\) 131.7 (C-3'), \\(d\\) 132.3 (C-4') and \\(d\\) 18.1 (C-5'), these being substantiated by the _g_HMQC correlations observed. Data from the _g_HMBC experiment (Table 1) also supported these conclusions. Correlation of the 1-COH hydrogen with C-2 and C-6, and between H-2'/C-6 and H-5/C-1' confirmed the linkage of the aldehyde at C-1 and of the penta-dienyl unit at C-6, respectively. 1D-TOCSY experiments, showed a complete set of sequence correlations for the penta-dienyl unit. 1D-NOE experiments were also conducted showing NOE between 1-COH/H-1', H-1'/H-3', H-5/H-2', H-2'/H-4' and H-4'/H-5' corroborating the _E_/_E_ suggested arrangement (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an endophytic fungus from _Xylopia aromatica_ (Annonaceae) and the first isolation of this class of compounds from _P. atropurprea_.\n\nCompounds **1**-**3 were evaluated against _Cladosporium sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ using direct bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). Only compound **2** exhibited strong antifungal activity against both fungi, showing a detection limit of 1.0 mg, comparable to nystatin (used as a positive control). Compound **1** did not show any antifungal activity, and **3** showed a relatively weak detection limit of 25.0 mg.\n\nCompounds **1**-**3 were also evaluated for cytotoxicity using HeLa and CHO mammalian cell lines. Compound **1** showed no activity to either cell lines, when compared to the vehicle-treated cells. Compound **2** was able to induce proliferation of HeLa cells (maximum of 37% of increased proliferation at 2.0 uM) and CHO cells (maximum of 38% of increased proliferation at 20.0 uM). Results obtained with compound **3** showed that it is a potent cytotoxic agent against the two mammalian cell lines analyzed. Compound **3** decreased cell viability of HeLa and CHO cells, with an IC50 of 8.0 uM, showing potency similar to that of cisplatin, a well known antineoplastic agent (IC50 5.0 uM), which was used as a cytotoxic positive control.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedure\n\nUV spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer UV-Vis Lambda-14P spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Impact-400 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded using a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, with TMS as an internal standard. HRESI mass spectra were obtained using a Bruker Daltonics (UltroTOF-Q) mass spectrometer. Analytical HPLC was performed with a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh and normal-phase silica gel G60 (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and pre-coated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) preparative column.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _Xylopia aromatica_ (Lamarck) Martius plant material was collected in \"Estacao Experimental de Araraquara\", Araraquara, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2001. The botanical identification was made by Professor Maria Claudia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SP 142.360).\n\n### Isolation of the endophytic fungus\n\nFor isolation of the endophytic fungus, adult and healthy leaves were selected and subjected to surface sterilization. They were first washed with water and soap, and then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and aqueous ethanol (3:7, %) for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and finally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 cm2 pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dex-rose-agar) and gentamicin sulfate (0.5 mg/ml) with approximately 3-4 pieces on each dish. The material was incubated at 25 degC for 10 days and the endophyte _P. atro\n\n## Page 4\n\npurpurea_ was isolated by replication and preserved in sterile water (Maier et al., 1997). The fungus was identified by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning using rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and deposited in the (Colecao Micologica de Lavras, at the Universidade Federal de Lavras fungal herbarium with the accession number CML 631).\n\n### Growth and production of the crude extract\n\nThe fungus was cultivated using three different culture media: PDB (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/1.01 H2O), Czapek (30.0 g saccharose; 3.0 g NaNO3; 1.0 g K2PO4; 0.5 g MgSO4; 0.5 g KCl; 0.01 g Fe2(SO4)3/1.01 H2O) and Czapek + polystyrene resin XAD-2. For the first medium, were used 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 ml), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 ml distilled water which were autoclaved at 125 degC for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA (potato extract, dextrose and agar) medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of the _P. atropurpurea_ isolated were inoculated into each flask and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 degC on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration, and the filtrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 x 200 ml). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase _in vacuo_ yielded a brown solid residue (129 mg). The above process was scaled up (4.0 l of PDB in 20 Erlenmeyer flasks) after the antifungal bioactivity against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ was detected, affording 1.44 g of EtOAc extract (A). For the other two culture media the process described was directly scaled up, using 5.0 l of Czapek medium [affording 200 mg of EtOAc extract (B)] and 1.01 of Czapeck + 50.0 g of XAD-2. After incubation, the resin XAD-2 was separated from medium by flotation and extracted with MeOH affording 700 mg of MeOH extract (C).\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\n_C. cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and _C. sphaerospermum_ (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay, and were maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds 1-**3** were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using solution (10 ml) containing 100, 50,0, 25, 10.0, 5.0 and 1.0 mg. After eluting with CHCl3-CH3OH (9:1), they were sprayed with spore suspensions of the fungi (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). Nystatin was employed as positive control.\n\n### Biological assays using mammalian cell lines\n\nBiological assays aiming to determine cell viability after treatment with the compounds were performed as described previously (Teles et al., 2005). Briefly, HeLa and CHO cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% Fetal calf Serum (FCS, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). A stock solution (20.0 mM) was prepared by dissolving compounds **1**-**3** in DMSO (vehicle). The final concentrations (200.0, 20.0 and 2.0 mM) were achieved by direct dilution into the cell medium. The compound **3** was also diluted in the following concentrations: 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 50.0 mM. After addition of the compound or the vehicle, cells (104 cells/well plated 24 h before) were analyzed after a period of 48 h using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983; Rubinstein et al., 1990).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nEtOAc extract A (1.44 g) was fractionated by CC using silica gel and eluted with a CHCl3-MeOH gradient (95:5 - 100% MeOH) affording 15 fractions. Fraction 01 (290 mg) was fractionated by CC using Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4, 200 ml); CH2Cl2-acetone (3:2, 200 ml), CH2Cl2-acetone (1:4, 200 ml), acetone (150 ml) and MeOH (150 ml), affording six sub-fractions. Sub-fraction 01 (11 mg) was further purified using reversed-phase prep. HPLC {_l_ = 235 nm, 10.0 ml/min, CH3CN-H2O (9:1)} affording 1 (2.8 mg, _Rt_ = 17 min). EtOAc extract B (200 mg) was fractionated by CC using reversed-phase silica gel and eluted with a MeOH-H2O gradient (25:75 - 100% MeOH) affording four fractions.

Oliveira, Luis O. Regasini, Geraldo H. Silva, Ludwig H. Pfenning, Maria C.M. Young, Roberto G.S. Berlininck, Vanderlan S. Bolzani, Angela R. Araujo\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe dihydroisocoumarin (3_R_AR_)-3.4-dihydro-4,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-car-boxylic acid (**1**) was isolated from _Xylaria_ sp., a fungus associated with _Piper aduncum_ (Pieraceae). Additionally, two known compounds, (_R_)-7-hydroxymellein (**2**) and (_3_R_AR_)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**), were isolated from _Penicillium_ sp. associated to _Alibertia macrophylla_ (Rubiaceae). The structures of all compounds were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data. The dihydrocoumarin derivatives **1**-3** showed antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities _in vitro_.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFungal endophytes comprise a wide range of fungi characterized by the ability to live for a certain period of their life-cycles internally and asymptomatically in plants (Wang et al., 2007). Such co-existence may confer adaptative advantages to the plant host, such as feeding deterrence, protection against insects and microbial pathogens (De Souza et al., 2004). Considering that chemical clues are usually involved in these biological interactions, natural products from endophytic fungi very often present a broad spectrum of biological activities (Zhang et al., 2006).\n\nIsocoumarins are metabolites of limited distribution, which occur in bacteria, fungi and lichen (Kutschera et al., 2003). These compounds have also been detected in secretions of termites and ants (Engelmeier et al., 2004). Several biological activities have been reported for this class, including cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antialergized, aljcidal, gastroprotective, protease inhibitory, antifungal (Ozcan et al., 2007; Krohn et al., 1997; Guimaraes et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009) as well as plant growth regulators (Kuramata et al., 2007).\n\nThe Brazilian cerrado trees are well known sources of bioactive secondary metabolites (Bolzani et al., 1991; Young et al., 1992; Silva et al., 2007, 2010). Among these, _A. macrophylla_ K. Schum (Rubiaceae) and _P. aduncum_ L. (Pieraceae) were chosen for a detailed microbiological investigation. These plants presented several endophytes, including _Penicillium_ and _Xylaria_ species, which were submitted to chemical and biological investigations.\n\nHerein, we report the isolation and biological activities of one new dihydroisocoumarin, (3_R_AR_)-3.4-dihydro-4,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid (**1**) and two known dihydroisocoumarins, (_R_)-7-hydroxymellein (**2**) and (3_R_AR_)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**). (3_R_AR_)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**) (Fig. 1).\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as yellow amorphous powder, and showed a positive reaction with ferric chloride suggesting the presence of a phenol functionality. The IR spectrum of **1** showed strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (3474 cm-1) and a conjugated carbonyl group (1672 cm-1). The UV spectrum of **1** displayed absorptions (lmax) (log e) at 220 (4.28) and 314 (3.34), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a dihydroisocoumarin structure (Pontius et al., 2008). Its elemental composition C11H10O6 with seven degrees of insaturation was deduced from its HRESIMs, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([M-H]) at m/22 370.0381 (caled for C11H9O6, 237.0399), consistent with its 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Extensive analysis of 1H-1H gCOSY, 1H-13C gHMQC, and 1H-13C\n\n## Page 2\n\ngHMBC NMR experiments enabled us to assign all \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C signals. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR, DEPT 90', and \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C gHMQC indicated that compound **1** had one methyl, four methines, and six quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 169.5 and \\(\\delta\\) 167.1, assigned to a carboxyl and to a 8-lactone groups, respectively. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR and \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)Hg gCOSY spectra of **1** showed two ortho-coupled hydrogens at \\(\\delta\\) 7.04 (H-8) and \\(\\delta\\) 8.10 (H-9), suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)Hg gCOSY spectrum indicated a spin system in **1** which included a methyl group at \\(\\delta\\) 1.43 (H\\({}_{3}\\)C-10) coupled with an oxymentine hydrogen at \\(\\delta\\) 4.72 (H-3), itself coupled with a methine hydrogen at \\(\\delta\\) 5.47 (H-4). Therefore, the aliphatic portion of **1** was unambiguously established as a H\\({}_{3}\\)C-CH(0-)CH-OH chain. Long-range correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum between H-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 7.04) with C-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 163.9), C-5 (\\(\\delta\\) 108.7), and C-8a (\\(\\delta\\) 120.0), between H-4 (\\(\\delta\\) 5.47) with C-4a (\\(\\delta\\) 144.8), C-5, C-8a and C-3 (\\(\\delta\\) 78.2), as well as between H-8 (\\(\\delta\\) 8.10) with C-6, C-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 167.1) and C-4a enabled us to establish unequivocally the substitution pattern of the aromatic moiety of **1**. A logical deduction of the data collected would obviously lead to the structure **1**. Since H-3 and H-4 showed a coupling constant of 1.8 Hz, these protons had an axial-equatorial relationship. Thus, the relative stereochemistry of compound **1** was established as (3_R_*, 4_R_*). This relative configuration at C-3 and C-4 was very similar when compared with data of similar isochronames (Okuno et al., 1986; Aldridge et al., 1971). A comparison of the optical rotation of **1** ([**_a_**]\\({}^{28}\\) -60.3, \\(c\\) 0.034, MeOH) with the literature values reported for three of the four possible 4-hydroxymellein stereoisomers (Devys et al., 1980) indicated that (3_R_*,4_R_*)-4-hydroxymellein has both the signal and magnitude of optical rotation ([**_a_**]\\({}_{0}\\) -1.5) comparable to compound **1**. Therefore, the absolute configuration of **1** was assigned as (3_R_*,4_R_*) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Hence, the structure of compound **1** was completely elucidated, and established as (3_R_*,4_R_*)-3.4-dihydro-4.6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid.\n\nIn addition, two known dihydroisocoumarins were isolated from a _Penicillin_ sp. and identified as (_R_*)-7-hydroxymethylein (**2**) and (3_R_*,4_R_*)-4.7-dihydroxymellein (**3**) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Compounds **2** and **3** were identified by analysis of spectroscopic data, as well as of optical rotation data, with literature values. Both **2** and **3** exhibited a rare 7.8-dihydroxy substitution. To date, related compounds have been isolated from plant and fungi sources, including _Azadifractha indica_, _Seporia nodorum_, _Cytospora euclypticola_, _Nodulisporum_ sp. and _Cephalosporium_ sp. (Devys et al., 1980; Siddiqui et al., 1988; Kokubun et al., 2003; Bi et al., 2006; Pontius et al., 2008). The cathecol moiety of **2** and **3** is probably formed after an additional oxidation at C-7, subsequently to the formation of the aromatic polyketide skeleton.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\ngel 230-400 mesh (Merck). IR spectra were obtained with PerkinElmer FTIR-1600 spectrophotometer, on KBr pellets. Optical rotations were measured with PerkinElmer polarimeter with sodium lamp operating at 589 nm at 28 degC.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _A. macrophylla_ K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) and _P. aduncum_ L. (Pieraceae) were collected in \"Estacao Ecologica Experimental de Mogi-Guacu, Fazenda Campininha\", Mogi-Guacu, S3o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identifications were assigned by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, Brazil (Voucher no. SP 370915 and Cordeiro PAO, respectively).\n\n### Isolation and identification of the endophytes\n\nAdult and healthy leaves of _P. aduncum_ and _A. macrophylla_ were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. Leaves were first washed with water and soap, then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and in 70% aqueous EtOH for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and finally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 x 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate (50 mg/mL), 3-4 pieces on each dish. The material of the two species was incubated at 25 degC for 10 days and the endophytes _Penicillium_ sp. and _Xylaria_ sp. were isolated by successive inoculation in Petri dishes from _Alibertia macrophyla_ and _P. aduncum_, respectively (Silva et al., 2006).\n\nThe fungus _Penicillium_ sp. was identified by Dr. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP - Centro Pluridiscipliner et Pesquisas Quimicas, Biologicas e Agricolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number 05070032-C. The fungus _Xylaria_ sp. was identified by Prof. Dr. Ludwing H. Pfenning (Universidade Federal de Lavras, Departamento de Fitopatologia) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number PA-01.\n\n### Growth of Xylaria sp. and extraction\n\nThe strain was inoculated in twenty Erlenmeyers (500 mL each) containing each one: 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose (PDB) in 300 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved at 121 degC for 15 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, for 28 days. The mycelia biomass accumulated in the Erlenmeyers was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration, and the filtrate was subjected to a liquid-liquid partition with EtOAC (3 x 2 L). The EtOAc fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g).\n\n#### Extraction and isolation of compound 1\n\nThe crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g) was purified by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting with MeOH, to afford 08 fractions (F-1-F-8, 100 mL portions). Compound **1** (175.0 mg) was obtained from fractions F-6 to F-7 as a yellow amorphous powder.\n\n### Growth of Penicillium sp. and growth medium extraction\n\nThe _Penicillium_ sp. strain was inoculated in nine Erlenmeyers (500 mL each), containing each one: 90 g of corn meal in 75 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 degC for 40 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC in still mode during 21 days. At the end of the growth period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6x 250 mL). The MeOH was evaporated, to give 15 g of the MeOH extract. The MeOH extract was dissolved in McN and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with hexane. The McN fraction was evaporated to give 6.0 g of a McN-deffated extract.\n\n#### Extraction and Isolation of compounds 2 and 3\n\nThe McN-deffated fraction obtained (6.0 g) was fractionated using a C18 reversed-phase CC, eluted with a gradient of MeOH in H2O (5-100% MeOH), to afford 16 fractions (Fri-Fri-Fri16). Fraction Fri-2 (218.0 mg) was further separated using RP-HPLC [l = 254 nm, 10.0 ml/ml, 8:2 H2O-McN (80 min)], to give compounds **2** (6.3 mg, _R_** = 40.3 min) and **3** (6.1 mg, _R_** = 30.0 min).\n\n_(3_R_**,_**\n\n## Page 4\n\nsee Table 2; HRESI-MS (negative ion): _m_/_z_ 209.0485 [M - H]- (caled for C10H10O5, 209.0459).\n\n### Antifungal activity\n\n_Cidasopporum cladosoprioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. _spherosperimum_ (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. Compounds **1**-**3** were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.00 and 1.00 mg samples of pure compounds. After eluting with CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the plates were sprayed with the fungi suspension (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was used as a positive control at 1.0 mg.\n\n### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity\n\nAcetylcholinesterase (1000 U) was dissolved in 150 mL of 0.05 M Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer at pH 7.8. Bovine serum albumin (150 mg) was added to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 degC. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol) in order to clean the plates before drying at 30 degC. After elution of samples in CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the TLC plates were dried at 30 degC for complete removal of solvent. The plates were then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and carefully dried at r.t. again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was deposited flat over plastic plugs in a covered plastic tank containing a small amount of H2O, in order to keep the humidity constant. The incubation of plates was performed at 37 degC for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple coloration after 1-2 min (if positive). Galantamine was employed as positive control 1.0 mg (Marston et al., 2002).\n\n## References\n\n- Aldridge, C.C., Galt, S., Giles, D., Turner, W.B., 1971. Metabolites of _Lasiodiophodia theobromane_.

Cardoso, Ian Castro-Gamboa, Giovana M. Bergamini, Alberto J. Cavalheiro, Dulce H. S. Silva, Marcia N. Lopes, Angela R. Araujo, Mayas Furlan, Hugo Verli, Vanderlan da S. Bolzani\n\n# Abstract\n\nA lignan with a new skeleton named elimarthinin (**1**) was isolated from an extract of the leaves of _Chimarrhis turbinata_, a Rubiaceae plant species. 13C NMR spectrometric techniques including 1D and 2D experiments and HRESIMMS provided unequivocal structural confirmation of this new C6C3 skeleton type. The relative configuration of **1** was established by 2D 1H-H analysis and \\(J\\) couplings, while its conformation was evaluated through molecular modeling using the RM1 semiempirical method, with the aid of coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. The antioxidant activity of the new derivative **1** and two known and previously isolated phenolic derivatives (**2** and **3**) was investigated. An IC50 value of 7.50 +- 0.5 _m_mol L-1 was obtained for the new derivative **1**, while **2** and **3** showed IC50 values of 18.60 +- 0.4 and 18.50 +- 0.6 _m_mol, respectively.\n\nAs part of our research project focusing on the photochemical investigation of new biologically active compounds from Amazonian plant species, the constituents of the leaves and banks from _Chimarrhis turbinata_ DC Prodr. (Rubiaceae) have been examined.1-5 Previous photochemical studies of C. _turbinata_ established the presence of indole alkaloids with weak anticholinesterase activity2 as well as several phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties.3,5 Herein, the isolation, structural elucidation, and conformational analysis of a new C6C3 ligand skeleton type (**1**) are reported.\n\nWe have previously described the isolation of the two known phenolic compounds **2** and **3**.4,6 Herein, their antioxidant properties along with those of compound **1** are reported and compared with those of the commercially available antioxidant BHT. Evaluation of the parameters related to the antioxidant activity was accomplished by measuring the free radical scavenging ability of the compounds toward DPPH.7\n\nThe liquid-liquid partitioning of the EtOH extract of air-dried leaves of C. _turbinata_, followed by a sequence of size exclusion chromatography of the EtOAc-soluble fraction on Sephadex LH-20 and further purification using C18 HPLC, eluted with a CH3CN/H2O (18:88 v/v) isocratie elution using a Phenomene Luna column (25.0 mm x 21.20 mm x 5 mm) at a flow rate of 10 mL min-1 and UV detection at 280 nm, afforded compound **1**.\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as an amorphous, pale brown powder, \\(\\left[ \\alpha \\right\\rbrack_{2}\\)35-204 (_c_ 0.01, MeOH), which was analyzed for C29H28O12 by a combination of HRESIM5 and 13C NMR data. The molecular formula of **1** was determined from the \\(\\left[ {\\text{M} - \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}} \\right\\rbrack^{+}\\) peak at _m_/_z_ 550.6433 (caled for C29H26O11.550.1475). The IR spectrum with absorption bands at 3403, 1705, 1657, and 1627 cm-1 suggested the presence of phenolic and carboxylic groups. The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** (Table 1) displayed signals for nine aromatic hydrogens, which indicates the presence of three aromatic ring systems with different substitution patterns. The signals at \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz), 7.33 (ddbr, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz), 2.0 Hz), and 7.23 (s) corresponded to the aromatic hydrogens of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted ring. Additionally, the signals at \\(d\\) 6.78 (d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz), 6.69 (d_, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz), 6.61 (_J_ = 8.0 Hz), 6.67 (dd_, \\(J\\) = 8.0; 2.0 Hz), 6.55 (sbr), and 7.32 (d_, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) were attributed to six aromatic hydrogens from 1,3,4 = substituted rings. These 1H NMR data clearly confirm the presence of three distinct aromatic moieties in **1**.\n\nThe 13C NMR spectrum of **1** showed signals for 29 different carbons: 11 quaternary (sp2), two of which are carbonyls (d 176.5, C-9; 173.6, C-7a), one quaternary (sp3); nine sp2 methines; four sp3 methines, three of which are oxymethine; and four methylenes, one of which is a sp3 methines. The signals at _d_c_ 146.10, 146.5, 116.8, 115.7, 123.8, 146.7, 146.0, 115.2, 116.5, and 121.7 were ascribed to two 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic systems characteristic of a catechol moiety.8 The signals at _d_c\n\n## Page 2\n\n117.7, 151.3, 115.7, 151.3, and 117.7 evidenced the presence of one 1,3,5-substituted aromatic ring.9 The signals at \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) 63.3, 70.2, 71.2, and 81.5 were assigned to a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran moiety. The signal at \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) 91.7 revealed a peculiar downfield shifted carbon, which, analyzed together with the signals at \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) 28.5, 41.3, 43.2, and 173.6, allowed us to attribute one part of the structure of **1** as being a trisubstituted lactone moiety (Table 1).\n\nDetailed analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H-1\\({}^{\\ast}\\)H COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra demonstrated that **1** bears a different skeleton, with two C6-C3 units similar to those found in ingids. Correlations between H-7 (2H, \\(\\delta\\) 3.06, d, \\(J\\) = 13.0; 17.5 Hz), H-8 (\\(\\delta\\) 4.22, dd, \\(J\\) = 13.0; 9.0 Hz), H-9' (2H, \\(\\delta\\) 2.70 and 2.75, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz), and H-8' (\\(\\delta\\) 3.33, m) were observed by \\({}^{1}\\)H-1\\({}^{\\ast}\\)H COSY. The hydrogen at \\(\\delta\\) 3.06 (H-7) has HMBC correlations with the aromatic carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 128.6 (C-1) and with a quaternary carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 0 176.5 (C-9), as well as a correlation with a melting carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 43.2 (C-8). Correlations of the methylene hydrogen resonating at \\(\\delta\\) 3.33 (H-8') with C-1' and C-9' and correlations of H2-9' with C-8' and C-7' are also evident. The hydrogen at \\(\\delta\\) 4.66 (H-2b) correlates with C-7' and C-3b. From these observations and the analysis of all \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data (Table 1), it is evident that the two caffeic acid units and a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system are connected to the \\(\\delta\\)-lactone moiety.\n\nThese data suggest the presence of a \\(\\delta\\)-lactone moiety linked at C-1' (ring C) and at C-2b (ring B), Figure 2. The anisotropic unshielded signals of the quaternary carbon C-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 91.7) might be explained by its ligands: oxygen, the aromatic carbon C-1', and C-2b. The correlations between H-2b (\\(\\delta\\) 4.66, d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz), H-3b (\\(\\delta\\) 3.68, dd, \\(J\\) = 2.5; 8.5 Hz), H2, H2-4b (\\(\\delta\\) 3.57, ddd, \\(J\\) = 2.5; 6.0, 6.5 Hz and \\(\\delta\\) 3.41, dd, \\(J\\) = 6.5; 11.0 Hz), and H2-5b (\\(\\delta\\) 3.32, m) indicate that ring B consists of a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system, biogenetically derived from a ttrose sugar unit (Figure 2). HMBC correlations from the aromatic hydrogens at \\(\\delta\\) 7.33 (H-2a) and 7.31 (H-6a) of the third 1,3,5-trisubstituted aromatic ring (A) with C-7a (\\(\\delta\\) 176.5) showed that the third aromatic system is the 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic ester moiety at C-3 of the tetrose ring (B) (Figure 2).\n\nThese observations and the presence of two caffeic acid moieties, which could be biogenetically defined as a neolignan, determined a skeleton formed by unusual couplings C-7-C-9' and HOC-9-C8'. The spectroscopic evidence and a literature survey of lignan types (neolignans and lignans) indicated that compound **1** has a new neolignan-type skeleton.\n\nThe relative configuration of the stereocenters at C-2b, C-3b, C4-b, C-7', and C-8 and the conformation of **1** were determined on the basis of coupling constants and conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. For C-2b and C-3b, the coupling constants of H-2b (\\(\\delta\\) 4.66 d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz) and H-3b (\\(\\delta\\) 3.68 dd, \\(J\\) = 8.5, 2.5 Hz) indicate a vicinal H-2bax-H-3bax position, which is in good agreement with the presence of the gallate moiety in the _b_-position at C-3b. For C-4b, the coupling constants of H-4b (\\(\\delta\\) 3.56 ddd, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 6.75, 2.5 Hz) also confirm an \\(\\alpha\\)-hydroxy group at this position. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR data recorded in methanol-_d_** clearly show all the coupling constants of H-4b with Hax and Hax-5b (Table 1) and confirmed the tetrose moiety as part of this molecule. The coupling constants of H-8 (\\(\\delta\\) 4.22 dddb, \\(J\\) = 9.0, 13.0 Hz) suggest the \\(\\alpha\\)-positioned 8-R, which is in accordance with the relative configuration of C-8. The relative configuration is assigned as 2_R_*, 3_R_*, 4_S_*, 7_S_*, and 8_R_*.\n\nTo confirm the relative configuration of C-2b, C-3b, C-4b, and C-8 and in order to establish the conformation of **1**, this structure was submitted to conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. The obtained minimum energy conformations enable estimation of \\({}^{3}\\)J\\({}_{\\text{HH}}\\) coupling constants by means of the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation,10 which considers the electronegativity of the substituents and the geometry of the H-C-C-H dihedral angle. A comparison between the theoretical and experimental coupling constants permitted the characterization of the conformation of charimarhinin, represented in Figure 3, with the respective theoretical coupling constants (Table 1), considering the most stable envelope conformation of the tetrahydrofuran ring and half-chair conformation of the tetrahydro-2-pyranone ring. Consistent with previous conformational analyses of natural products with diverse skeletons,11,11,12 the employed semiempirical calculations agreed with experimental data more satisfactorily when compared with older Hamiltonians such as AM1 and PM3 and _ab initio_ HF/6-31G** calculations.\n\nThe radical scavenging effects observed for compounds 1-3 assayed with DPPH are summarized in Table 2, the standard antidotant BHT (IC50 62.50 +- 0.6 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{- 1}\\)), and chlorogenic acid (IC50 20.0 +- 0.2 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{- 1}\\)) used as reference. The results indicate that the free radical scavenging activity of these molecules is due to their hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the stabilization of the phenoxy radical after DPPH reduction. Stabilization is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and, in the case of the phenylpropanoids (**2**, **3**), the \\(\\alpha\\),b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by their IC50 values. Compound **1** gave the best results, with an IC50 value lower than that of the standard BHT, a well-known food antioxidant. This result may be related to the presence of two catechol groups in this molecule.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nOptical rotation measurements were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz cuvette (length 1 cm). IR spectra were measured on either a Perkin-Elmer 1600 or a Nicolet EMACT-40 FTIR spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and at 125 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C. TMS was used as internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained at high resolution on a Micromass Q-TOF spectrometer. For chromatographic procedures, Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) was employed. Preparative HPLC separations were performed on a Varian Prep LC 4000 System, and C18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns and precolumns were utilized.\n\nFigure 1.: Compounds from _C. turbinatea._\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nPeaks were detected using a Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All solvents (Merck or Mallinckrodt) were analytical or HPLC grade. The theoretical study was carried out using the semiempirical RMI method on MOPAC 7.0 software.\n\n**Plant Material.**_Chimarthis turbinate_ was collected in Reserva do Viro, Belem, PA, Brazil, in February 2000, and identified by Dr. Marina Thereza V. do A. Campos. A voucher specimen, Lopes-51, was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo.\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** Dried and powdered leaves of C. _turbinate_ (1.2 kg) were exhaustively extracted with EtOH at room temperature to afford 57.1 g of dry residue, which was dissolved in MeOH/H2O (8:2, v/v) and extracted with _n_-hexane. The aqueous alcoholic fraction was evaporated to roughly MeOH/H2O (6:4, v/v) and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOH2, and _n_-BuOH. All fractions were screened with _b_-carotene and DPPH assays, aiming at selecting potential antioxidant compounds. The EtOH2 layer was active in these assays, and this extract was selected for guided fractionation. The dried EtOH2 extract (4:16 g) was dissolved in MeOH (5 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20. A total of 25 fractions of 25 mL each were collected and pooled according to their TLC profiles (CHCl2/MeOH/H2O, 65:30:5). Fractions A-6,7 and A-8 to A-12 exhibited antioxidant activity and were further purified by HPLC. Fractions A-8 to A-12 yielded the compounds described elsewhere.3,4\n\nFraction A-6,7 (0.699 g) was purified by gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 CC (88.0 cm x 2.0 cm), which was eluted with MeOH, giving 36\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}  & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{gHMQC} \\\\ position & \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\text{H}}\\) (_J_ in Hz) & \\(J\\) (Hz)bover & gHMBC & COSY & TOGSY \\\\\n1 & 125.6 & & & H-7 & & \\\\\n2 & 116.8 & 6.78 d (2.0) & n.d.c & H-5 &\n\n## Page 4\n\nfractions of 10.0 mL each. The fractions B-20-30 (0. 387 g) tested positively in the b-carotene and DPPH assays, and they were further combined and subjected to preparative HPLC separation using CH3CN/H2O isocratic elution (18.88) [Phenomenex C18 Luna column 25.0 mm x 12.20 mm x 5 mm, at 10 mL.min-1, with UV detection at 280 nm], to afford 10 subfractions. From those, C-3 (97.2 mg) was separated by preparative HPLC using the same column described above [isocratic elution; H2O/MeCN/HOAc (84.5:15:0.5), UV detection at 237 nm, 12.0 mL min-1 flow rate], to give compound 1 (4.3 mg).\n\n### Molecular Modeling.\n\nThe semiempirical calculations were carried out using the RM1 Hamiltonian13 within the MOPAC 7.0 program.14 The MOLDEN program was employed as a graphic interface for construction and visualization of the structure of compound 1.15 Hessian matrix analyses were used to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. Additionally, the minimum energy achieved by RM1 was further refined through _ab initio_ calculations, using the GAMESS program16 at the HF/6-31G** level. In order to obtain theoretical 3\\({}^{\\text{7}}_{\\text{JHH}}\\) coupling constants for the minimum energy conformation achieved by conformational analysis, the Haasonot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation15 was applied to the H-C-C-H dihedral angle geometries.\n\n### Bleaching Experiments Using b-Carotene.\n\nAfter being developed and dried, TLC plates were sprayed with 0.02% b-carotene solutions (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of the background. The remaining yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.7\n\n### Determination of the Radical Scavenging Activity.\n\nThe DPPH radical was used in MeOH (100 _m_mol L-1). The reagent (2.0 mL) was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds previously dissolved in MeOH, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 _m_mol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and kept at room temperature for 30 min, in the dark. Chlorogenic acid and BHT were employed as standards. A DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in MeOH (1.0 mL) served as a control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured at 517 nm using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer, and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH-treated control group.\n\n_Chimarhinin (1)._ amorphous, pale brown powder, [_a_]25_, \\(b\\) -204 (_c_ 0.01, MeOH); IR (KBr) 3410 (OH), 1656, and 1604 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR (see Table 1); HRESIMs _m/z_ 550.6433 [M - H2O]+ (caled for C23H26O11550.1475).\n\n## Associated Content\n\n### Supporting Information.\n\nThis material is available free of charge via the Internet at [http://pubs.acs.org](http://pubs.acs.org).\n\n## Author Information\n\n### Corresponding Author\n\n* Tel: 55 16 3301 9660.

Vieira-Junior, Luiz A. Dutra, Paulo M. P. Ferreira, Manoel O. de Moraes, Leticia V. Costa Lotufo, Claudia do O Pessoa, Roseli Buzanelli Torres, Nivaldo Boralle, Vanderlan da S. Bolzani, Alberto J. Cavalheiro\n\n###### Abstract\n\nFour new clerodane diterpenes, caseaurepestrins A-D (1**-**4**), were isolated from the leaves of _Casearia rupestris_. Compounds **1** and **4** were acetylated to yield 2,7-di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin A (**5**) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin D (**6**). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Caseaurepestrin A (**1**) exhibited the most potent activity against MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) cells, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe tropical genus _Casearia_ (_Salicaceae sensu lato_) contains ca. 180 species,1 and it is a rich source of clerodane-type diterpenes,2-13 The genus occurs widely in Brazil, where C. _sylvestris_ is the most frequent species, occurring from the Amazon basin throughout the Cerrado (savanna) to the Atlantic Forest and Southern Brazil. The clerodanes are a group of diterpenoids with interesting biological effects such as antifungal,14 antichismamial and antiplasmodal,15 antimalarial and antimyobacterium1,16 antitumor,17,18 cytotoxic,14,19,16-31 immunomodulatory,32 immunodulatory,32 and trypanodal activities.33 In our continuing investigation of the bioactive clerodane diterpenes from _Casearia_ species, we undertook the first phytochemical investigation of _Casearia rupestris_ Eichler. This shrub or small tree grows up to 6.0 m in height and is found in Brazil (Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais States) and Bolivia (Sta. Cruz State) in the Cerrado, grasslands, and sometimes pastures, at altitudes of 350-500 m.34 Investigation of the cytotoxic Et2O fraction yielded four new clerodane diterpenes (1**-**4**) (Figure 1). Compounds **1** and **4** were acetylated, resulting in two new derivatives (**5**, **6**) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic activity of the diterpenes (1**-**6**) against a panel of human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MDA/MB-435, HCT-8, and SF-295) has been evaluated.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nInvestigation of the Et2O phase of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. _nupestris_ led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, caseaurepestrins A-D (1**-**4**). 2,7-Di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin A (**5**) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin D (**6**) were obtained by acetylation of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. The structures (Figure 1) of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric data (IR, UV, NMR, and MS) and by comparison with NMR data of reported compounds.6\n\nCaseaurepestrin A (**1**) was obtained as a white, amorphous solid ([a]24D +4.3 (c 1.0, MeOH)). The molecular formula\n\n## Page 2\n\nC34H48O9 was determined by HRESIMS, based on the sodiated ion peak at _m_/_z_ 623.3190 \\([\\)M + Na\\(]^{+}\\) (calcd 623.3190), which implies 11 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the presence of carbonyl esters (1746 and 1712 cm-1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions at _l_max 223 nm (log \\(e\\) 1.40) and 268 nm (log \\(e\\) 1.50), corresponding to diene and dienome chromophores, respectively. The 13C and DEPT 135deg NMR data showed the presence of 34 carbons divided into seven quaternary (including three carbonyl carbons), 13 methine, nine methylene, and five methyl carbons. The olefinic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of **1** (Table 1) revealed proton signals with characteristic _cis_/_trans_ coupling at \\(d\\)0 5.06 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 10.5 Hz, H-15), 5.30 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 17.5 Hz, H-15), and 6.47 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 10.5, 17.5 Hz, H-14), indicating a terminal monosubstituted olefinic moiety. Another terminal methylene, identified by two singlets at _d_H 4.94 and 5.03 (2H, H-16), was connected to a quaternary carbon (C-13). An additional olefinic doublet was observed at _d_H 6.04 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 4.0 Hz, H-3) and correlated to a methine carbon at _d_C 128.6 (C-3) in the gHMQC spectrum. Two deshielded acid protons were observed at _d_H 6.35 (1H, t, \\(J\\) = 1.5 Hz, H-18) and 6.49 (1H, s, H-19), which correlated to methine signals at _d_C 96.3 and 99.8, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed the presence of two methyl groups at _d_H 1.06 (1H, brd, \\(J\\) = 4.0 Hz, H-17) and 1.07 (1H, s, H-20) and three oxymethines at _d_H 4.45 (1H, brd, \\(J\\) = 4.0 Hz, H-2), 5.18 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz, H-6), and 3.66 (1H, t, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz, H-7). The spectroscopic data of 1 (Tables 1 and 2) are in accord with the basic skeleton of clerodane diteroprenoids previously isolated from _Cascaria_ species.10,18,35 The acyclic moiety at C-9, including the diene group, was deduced from the correlations of H-12 with C-11, H-14 with C-13 and C-16, H-15 with C-13 and C-14, and H-16 with C-14 (Figure 2). The position of the hydroxy group at C-7 was deduced by the long-range correlation of the oxymethine signal at _d_H 3.66 (H-7) with _d_C 77.5 (C-6), 44.8 (C-8), and 11.7 (C-17) (Figure 2). A decadienoate moiety, identified by gHMBC and gCOSY correlations (Figure 2), was characterized by a \\(Z\\) - (_d_H 5.68, \\(J\\) = 11.5 Hz; 6.69, \\(J\\) = 11.5 Hz) and an _E_-double bond (_d_H 7.37, \\(J\\) = 14.0, 11.5 Hz; 6.16, \\(J\\) = 14.0, 7.0 Hz) and a triplet methyl (_d_H 0.98, \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz). This same \n\n## Page 3\n\n19-epoxy-7-(['2/_Z_,_A_'_E_)-decadienoyloy]-2,6-dihydroxy-18-methoxy-yclero-3,13(16),14-triene.\n\nCompound **4** had the molecular formula C36H50O10, determined by HRESIMS (observed _m_/_z_ 665.3297 [M + Na]+). The 1H and 13C NMR data of **4** (caseuarpestrin D) (Tables 1 and 2) were similar to those of **2** except for replacement of a hydroxy group at C-6 by an acetyone group [d1.195 (3H, s), d1C 171.5, d20.9]. The 1H and 13C NMR assignments of compound **4** were confirmed by 2D NMR correlations, and its configuration was established by the sign of the specific rotation, NOESY interactions, and coupling constants (Figure 3). Thus, caseuarpestrin D (**4**) was assigned as _rel_-(2R,S,S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-6,18, 19-triacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7.[('2/_Z_,_A_'E_)-decadienoyloy]-2-hydro-yclero-3,13(16),14-triene.\n\nAcetylation of **1** and **4** with d2O-pyridine yielded two new clerodane direprenes derivatives, **5** and **6**, respectively (Tables 1 and 2, NMR data). The products were named 2,7-di-O-acetylcaseuarpestrin A (**5**) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcaseuarpestrin D (**6**).\n\nThe results of the biological tests of compounds **1**-**6** are shown in Table 3. Caseuarpestrins A (**1**), B (**2**), and D (**4**) showed significant cytotoxicity against four cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC50 values ranging from 0.10 to 1.3 _m_M. Compound **1** had an IC50 value of 0.36 _m_M against MDA/MB-435 and SF-295 cancer cell lines, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (Table 3). Acetylation of compounds **1** and **4** resulted in decreased cytotoxicity (Table 3), indicating that the C-2 OH group is essential for the cytotoxicity of these compounds.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nOptical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 LC polarimeter. UV spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 A spectrometer. The circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a JASCO PU-2089 HPLC system configured with a UV-vis (MD-2010) and a circular dichroism (CD-2095) detector. IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet Impact 400 spectrometer, using KBr disks. The 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT, and NOE)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}   position & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** & **6** \\\\\n1 & 2.00 m & 1.34 m & 1.96 m & 2.10 m & 2.19 m & 2.08 m \\\\  & 2.06 m & 1.91 m & & & & 2.17 m \\\\\n2 & 4.45 brt (4.0) & 4.39 brt (4.0) & 4.37 brt (4.0) & 4.35 brt (4.0) & 5.55 m & 5.52 m \\\\\n3\n\n## Page 4\n\nand 2D (\\({}^{1}\\)H-1\\({}^{1}\\)HgCOSY, \\({}^{1}\\)H-1\\({}^{3}\\)C gHMQC, gHMBC, and gNOSSY) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (\\({}^{1}\\)H) and 125 MHz (\\({}^{13}\\)C) with pulse field gradient and a Varian INOVA 300 spectrometer (7.4 T) at 300 MHz (\\({}^{1}\\)H) and 75 MHz (\\({}^{13}\\)C), using methanol-\\(d_{4}\\) as the internal standard for \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR chemical shifts and residual undeuterated solvent (methanol) as the internal standard for \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR, with the \\(\\delta\\) scale reported relative to TMS. Positive-ion HRMS spectra were recorded on an UltraOTOFq (Bruker Daltonics) ESI-qTOF mass spectrometer, using TFANa as the internal standard. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 with UV-vs detector (model 330), using a Phenomence C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \\(\\mu\\)m). Open column chromatography was performed over silica gel (40-63 \\(\\mu\\)m, Merck) or silica C18 (40 \\(\\mu\\)m, J. T. Baker) or on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF354 plates. Spots on TLC plates were observed under UV light and by spraying the plates with anisaldehyde\\(-\\)H2SO4 reagent, followed by heating at 120 degC.\n\nPlant Material. _Casesaria rupstris_ leaves were collected in May 2007 in Campinas municipality, Saio Paulo State, Brazil. The plant material was identified by one of the authors (R.B.T.). A voucher specimen (IAC41542) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Agronomico de Campinas (Sao Paulo State).\n\n### Extraction, Isolation, and Chemical Transformation.\n\nThe dried and ground leaves (0.46 kg) were exhaustively extracted by successive macration with hexanes, EtOH, and H2O (3.0 L x 3) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was concentrated under reduced pressure at 40 degC to yield 30.0 g of a crude extract. This extract was then diluted with MeOH\\(-\\)H2O (3:1) and successively partitioned with hexanes (1.0 L x 3), Et2O (1.0 L x 3), and Et2OAc (1.0 L x 3). After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 10.8, 3.2, and 1.2 g, respectively. Part of the cytotoxic Et2O (3.0 g) fraction was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (78.0 x 3.0 cm) eluted with MeOH, to afford 38 fractions. These fractions were combined on the basis of their TLC profiles. Fraction 12 (1.7 g) was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel-C18, 78.0 x 3.0 cm,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n1 & 30.6, CH2 & 30.6, CH2 & 30.6, CH2 & 30.5, CH2 & 27.8, CH2 & 27.8, CH2 \\\\\n2 & 64.2, CH & 64.2, CH & 64.3, CH & 64.0, CH & 67.5, CH & 67.4, CH\n\n## Page 5\n\n40 \\(\\mu\\)m) using a step gradient from H2O\\(-\\)MeOH 23:77 to 00:100, yielding 55 fractions. Fraction 14 (175.0 mg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (21.8 x 2 cm, 230\\(-\\)400 mesh) eluted with hexane\\(-\\)EtOAc (6:4), to yield compound 1 (7.9 mg). Fraction 30 (88.0 mg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (21.8 x 2 cm, 40\\(-\\)63 \\(\\mu\\)m) eluted with hexane\\(-\\)EtOAc (4:6) to yield compound 2 (13.0 mg). Fraction 34 (150.5 mg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (21.8 x 2 cm, 40\\(-\\)63 \\(\\mu\\)m) eluted with hexane\\(-\\)EtOAc (1:1) to yield compound 3 (10.0 mg). Finally, fraction 36 (356.0 mg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (21.8 x 2 cm, 40\\(-\\)63 \\(\\mu\\)m) eluted with hexane\\(-\\)EtOAc (1:1) to yield compound 4 (212.0 mg). Compounds 1 and 4 (20 mg each) were dissolved in pyridine (4.0 mL) and treated with AcO(3.0 mL) at room temperature for 24 h. The solvents were removed by evaporation under reduced pressure, resulting in compounds 5 (18.0 mg) and 6 (18.0 mg).\n\n_Cosequercetin A (1_): White, amorphous solid; [o]24 +-3 (_c_ 0.1, CHCl3); UV \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{MOH}}\\) (nm (_log_c_) \\(2\\)23 (1.40), 268 (1.50)).

However, the occurrence of the new guanidine-type alkaloid **1** can be explained by taking into account the imine tautomerism (Figure 1).\n\nNitensidine E (**2**) was isolated as a colorless oil. The molecular formula was determined to be C1H1H3N by HRESIMS (_m/z_ 194.2900 [M + H]+, calcd for C1H20N3, 194.2888), suggesting four degrees of unsaturation, with one additional unsaturation when compared with nitensidine D. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound **2** (Table 1) indicated structural characteristics somewhat different from those of **1** and the other guanidines isolated previously from _P. nitens_.4 Considering that **2** possesses four unsaturations and showed positive Dragonoff's and Sakaguchi's tests, an alkaloid structure was deduced for this compound. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited the presence of a set of typical resonances at \\(d\\) 5.52 (d, \\(J\\) = 15.0 Hz), 5.81 (d, \\(J\\) = 10.5 Hz), and 6.20 (dd, \\(J\\) = 15.0, 10.5 Hz), characteristic of a sp2-conjugated system, which could be attributed to an _E_-diene unit based on the coupling constants shown for these hydrogens. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) showed resonances for three methine sp2 carbons at \\(d\\) 135.4, 125.2, and 123.9 and for one quaternary sp2 carbon at \\(d\\) 135.0. Additionally, both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed the presence of two vinyl methyl groups (_b_ 1.69 (18.0), 1.73 (25.5)] and a tertiary methyl group at \\(d\\) 1.26 (27.6). These data revealed the presence of a C10 alkyl chain, which could be attributed to a monoterpene-type unit. The structural evidence from the spectroscopic data obtained allowed us to elucidate compound **2** with a guanidine alkaloid structure. Additionally, the mutually coupled methylenes [_d_ 1.61 (1H, m), 1.79 (1H, ddd, \\(J\\) = 13.5, 4.0, 3.5 Hz), and 2.92 (1H, ddd, \\(J\\) = 12.0, 14.0, 4 Hz), and \\(d\\) 3.15 (1H, ddd, \\(J\\) = 12.0, 4.0, 3.5 Hz)] would be compatible with a cyclic guanidine structure for **2**. Indeed, this proposal was confirmed from the gHMBC spectrum. The location of the methyl group C-10 was assigned at C-3 due to the observed gHMBC correlations between the methyl protons at H-10 and C-2, C-3, and C-4. Further, gHMBC cross-peaks between H-4 and C-2, C-10, C-6; H-1 and C-2, C-3; H-2 and C-10, C-4; and H-6 and C-8, C-9 completed the assignment of a cyclic guanidine-type alkaloid and its substituents. Also, a C10 alkyl chain composed of an _E_-diene unit was confirmed through NOESY correlations observed for H-4 and H-6. The conformation adopted by this molecule was evaluated in a preliminary manner employing semiempirical calculations (Hamiltonian as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G**), and a plausible conformation obtained for compound **2** with the methyl group at C-3 in the _b_-position is shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information. In Figure S2 (Supporting Information) we show a biogenetic proposal for the formation of the new guanidine derivatives **1** and **2**.\n\nIn addition to **1** and **2**, three known compounds were isolated and identified as pterogyrine10 (**3**), pterogyridine4 (**4**), and gaseleine11 (**5**). Compound **5** was first isolated from _Verbesina enclooides_ (Asteraceae) and later identified as a toxic and antidiabetic component from _Galega officials_ (Goat's Rue).12 Galegine was a template for the design of metformin and other biquanide-type hypoglycemic drugs.13 The identification of compounds **3-5** was based on 1H and 13C NMR and MS data analysis and by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory.4,10,11\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of biological activities has been described for guanidine alkaloids belonging to marine sources, few studies were reported from higher plants and of the potential anticancer activity of this class of natural products.14-16 All isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity, using a MTT assay, evidencing a key role of the prenyi substitution pattern in the level of activity. The cytotoxic activity of compounds **1-5** was evaluated _in vitro_ against HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma). Mean concentration inhibitory (IC50) values were determined using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol, with slight modifications, and the results are shown in Table 2. In human cells, nitensidine E (**2**) was the most active compound, showing activity for the different cell lines (Table 2). Therefore, guanidine alkaloids **2** may be useful as a prototype compound for the development of new antineoplastic drugs. Further work to evaluate the mechanism of action of the guanidine alkaloids characterized in this study is currently in progress.\n\nThe structural features of nitensidines D (**1**) and E (**2**) appear less common than the guanidine alkaloids already reported from other higher plants. It is noteworthy that the majority of these alkaloids contain isoperly groups. Only one alkaloid having a similar geranyl side chain has been previously isolated from _Fontainea pancheri_ (Euphorbiaceae).17 In some cases, the isopentenyl groups have undergone cyclization to produce hexahydroimidazolo-pyrimidines, typical of _Alchomea_ species (Euphorbiaceae).18,19 The structure of nitensidine E (**2**) constitutes the first report of the\n\nFigure 1: Ininic tautomeric forms of guanidine-type alkaloids **1** and **1a**.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nnatural occurrence of a cyclic monoterpene derivative on a guanidine moiety.\n\nTo date, the isolation and characterization of preynlated guanidine alkaloids has been reported only within a limited number of plant genera.[20, 21, 22] Furthermore, terpenoid-like alkaloids may have some taxonomic significance for Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae, since their occurrence is most common among these taxa.\n\n### Experimental Section\n\n**General Experimental Procedures.** 1D (\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)H, \\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)C, DEPT 90\\(\\times\\) and DEPT 135\\(\\times\\)) and 2D (\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)H\\(-\\)H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (H) and 125 MHz (\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)C), using DMSO-\\(d_{\\theta}\\) as an internal standard. Positive-ion high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an HRMS ultroTOTO-gSL-TCOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics). IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr disks. Optical rotations were measured on a Polarant A Carl Zeiss jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (\\(>\\) 230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 Tc, as well as by using Dragendorff's and Sakaguchi's reagents. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden.\n\n**Plant Material.**_Prerogen nitenes_ leaves were collected at the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sko Paulo State, Brazil).\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The shade-dried leaves (2.8 kg) of _P. nitenes_ were ground and defatted with hexane (2.0 L x 5, at room temperature, for five weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macroactin with ethanol (4.0 L x 5) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (\\(<\\)40 IC) to yield 12.7 g of a syrup. The concentrate was then diluted with CHOH-H2O (4.1) (3.5 L) and partitioned successively with EOAc (5.0 L x 3) and _n_-butanol (5.0 L x 3). After removal of the solvent 3.7 and 5.9 g of extract were afforded, respectively. The _n_-butanol residue was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sephadex LH-20 (2.5 g) in methanol to afford nine fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC visualized with Sakaguchi's[24] and Dragendorff's reagents, to yield an alkaloidal fraction (587 mg). Separation of this fraction on reversed-phase silica gel column chromatography (RP-18) by elution with increasing amounts of McN in H2O afforded eight fractions (ALK-1\\(-\\)ALK-8) and guanidine **5** (18 mg). Fraction ALK-3 (121 mg) was subjected to repeated column chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluted with CHCl3-MeOH mixtures (ranging from 0 to 35% MeOH), to furnish the isoperylated alkaloids **3** (27 mg) and **4** (12 mg). Fraction ALK-7 (62 mg) was further purified by RP-HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (16:84:0.01), UV detection at 235 nm; flow rate 13 mL/min], affording the new separated alkaloids **1** (22 mg) and **2** (11 mg).\n\n**Nitensidine **D (1)**: colorless oil; IR (KBr) _r_max 1652, 1618, 1012, 845 cm-1; H and 3C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMs _m/z_ 196.3052 [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) (caled for C1H2N19, 196.3063).\n\n**Nitensidine E (2)**: colorless oil; [a]\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\)25\\({}_{\\rm{i}}\\) +140.0 (_c_ 0.01, MeOH); IR (KBr) _r_max 1649, 1618, 1093, 839 cm-1; 1H and 1C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMs _m/z_ 194.2900 [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) (caled for C1H2N19, 194.2888).\n\n**Cytotoxicity Assay.** The cytotoxicity of the guanidine alkaloids **1\\(-\\)5** was tested against four tumor cell lines: HL-60 (human leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 IC with 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (10\\({}^{\\rm{i}}\\) cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 x 10\\({}^{\\rm{6}}\\) cells/well for suspended cells in 100 _m_L of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39\\(-\\)25 mg/mL) dissolved in DMSO (5%) were added to each well and incubated for three days. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Doxorubicin (0.01\\(-\\)0.58 _m_g/mL) was used as positive control. Growth of tumor cells was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2,4-diazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan product. At the end of 72 h incubation, the medium in each well was replaced by fresh medium (200 _m_L) containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product of MTT reduction was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (Spectra Count, Packard, Ontario, Canada). Drug effect was quantified as the percentage of control absorbance of reduced dye at 590 nm. The IC\\({}_{\\rm{i}}\\)0 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHAPD program (Institutive Software for Science, San Diego).[25]\n\n**Acknowledgment.** This work was funded by grants of the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) as part of Biota-FAPESP, The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biotasp.org.br), grant no. 03/02176-7, awarded to V.S.B.

HO-MODE experiments were carried out decoupling H-2' (\\(\\delta\\) 1.64), which enabled the loss of multiplicity from the neighboring H-1' and H-3' (overlapped with H-4'). When H-5' was decoupled, loss of multiplicity was observed for H-6' and H-4' (overlapped with H-3'), supporting the same chemical shift for H-3' and H-4'. The same pattern was observed with H-10' and H-11' when H-9' and H-12' were decoupled. The interpretation of these gHMRC sequence cross-peaks led to the establishment of the oxo function at the C-7' position in the side chain. Furthermore, the gHMRC correlations of H-5 with C-3 (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_) and C-1' (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_), together with that from H-7 to C-2 (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_) and C-3 (\\({}^{3}\\)_J_), allowed the hydroxy group to be located at C-3, which was consistent with a previous study on bioactive piperidine alkaloids from _Senna_ (_Cassia_) species, with features similar to **1.3** Additionally, the gHMRC (\\({}^{1}\\)H\\({}^{-15}\\)N) spectrum showed a correlation between the nitrogen signal at \\(\\delta\\) 308.8 and signals at \\(\\delta\\) 2.67 (H-1'), 6.84 (H-5), and 2.47 (H-7). All this evidence agreed with the hydroxy group being located at C-3 and confirmed the assumption made on the substitution pattern in pyridine alkaloid **1**, which must be 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-_n_-(7'-oxodocyl) pyridine, similar to those found for piperidine alkaloids from other _Senna_ (_Cassia_) species, except for the ketone group position in the side chain. These results suggested that the hydroxy group of this pyridine alkaloid is at C-3, which is not in agreement with those previously reported for a similar pyridine alkaloid from this species, with no hydroxy group being located at C-5.5\n\nCompound **2** was obtained as a white solid, mp 71\\(-\\)73 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, and gave a positive test with Dragonoff reagent. This compound showed spectroscopic features very similar to those of **1**. The HRESITOFMS for **2** exhibited a pseudomolecular ion peak at _m/z_ 308.2226 [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) (called for C18H30NO3, 308.2220), appropriate for the molecular formula C18H29NO3, with a hydrogen deficiency index of 5 and being 16 mass units more than that of 1. The IR spectrum revealed the carbonyl absorption band at 1703 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), a pyridine ring at 1584, 1489, and 1464 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and a hydroxy group band at 3392 cm\\({}^{-1}\\). The \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of compound **2** showed signals very close to those of **1** (Table 1), as in the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR system, which demonstrates the presence of a substituted pyridine ring system at \\(\\delta\\) 7.02 (1H, \\(d\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-4) and 6.85 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-5). Additionally, the methyl hydrogens of CH3-7 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.48, analyzed together with \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data, confirmed that the pyridine moiety is similar to that of **1**. However, differences were evident between these compounds since the methyl group (CH3-12') located in the side chain of **1** was replaced with a hydroxy methylene group in **2** at \\(\\delta\\) 3.67 (2H, t, \\(J\\) = 6.5, H-12', \\(\\delta\\)\\({}_{C}\\) 62.5). These data, supported by the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR, DEPT, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY, and HOMODEC spectra, were in agreement with a pyridine system bearing one hydroxy group, one methyl, and one long-chain substituent. According to these data, the structure of **2** was determined as 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-_n_-(7'-oxo-12'-hydroxy-dodecyl)pyridine. All compounds isolated were screened for their AChE inhibitory activity, using bioautography and microplate tests, and the results are shown in Table 2. The preliminary TLC assay suggested moderate activity for compounds **1** and **2**, which showed the minimum amounts of these alkaloids required for AChE inhibition of 0.75 and 0.18 \\(\\mu\\)g, respectively, when compared with physostigmine (positive control, 0.05 \\(\\mu\\)g). Rutin proved to be inactive, since the minimum amount required to show activity was over 100 \\(\\mu\\)g. In addition, the microplate test confirmed activity of the compounds **1** and **2**, which exhibited weak AChE inhibition of 13% and 30% at 350 mM.\n\n### Experimental Section\n\n**General Experimental Procedures.** Melting points were recorded on a digital Microquimica MQAPF-302 apparatus and are uncorrected. UV data were acquired using an Amersham Ultrospec 2100 pro UV/viv spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet SiO10 FT-IR spectrometer coupled with an ATR accessory (the samples were pressed against a crystal of Ge). The 1D ('H, \\({}^{13}\\)C, DEPT, NOESY, TOSSY, and fMMODEC) and 2D ('H\\({}^{-14}\\) gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and H\\({}^{-15}\\)N gHMRC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7) at 500 MHz ('H) and 125 MHz ('IC) at 30 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C and referenced using TMS (\\(\\Omega_{\\rm{TBS}}\\) = 0.00) as internal standard or residual solvent resonances of CDCl3 at 7.26 and 77.0 ppm, respectively, for 'H and 'C. High-resolution mass spectra with electrospray ionization were measured on an altrOTOFO (Bruker Daltonics) operating in positive mode. MeOH\\(-\\)H2O (4:1) was used as solvent system.\n\nTLC was performed on silica gel F5x4 plates (0.20 mm, Fluka), and spots were visualized under UV light (254 and 366 nm) and spraying with Dragonoff's reagent or anisiodded\\(-\\)H2SO4. followed by charring for 5 min. Preparative TLC was carried out with Anatech 500 \\(\\mu\\)m thick silica gel GF plates (20 x 20 cm, Uniplate) and visualized under UV light at 366 nm. Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) ProStar system equipped with a ternary pump model 340, a photodiode array detector model 330, and an autosampler model 410, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.52 software. Preparative HPLC separation was performed on a Varian PrepStar system equipped with a UV\\(-\\)vis detector model 320 and a binary pump model SD-1 manual injector, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.51 software. The columns used were a Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 x 4.60 mm, 5 mm) and a preparative Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 x 21.20 mm, 10 \\(\\mu\\)m) protected by corresponding guard columns. All solvents used in the experimental procedures were distilled previously. For chromatographic analysis, HPLC-grade solvents (J. T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico) were employed. Water was purified immediately prior to use with a Milli Q plus system (Millipore, Milford, MA).\n\n**Plant Material.** Leaves of _S. multigas_ were collected in Araraquara (Sao Paulo, Brazil) in July 2008 by one of the authors (M.P.). The plant was identified by Jnss Cordeiro from the Institute of Botany in Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil. A voucher specimen (SP 384103) has been deposited in the herbarium of this institute.\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The dried and powdered leaves (2.7 kg) were extracted with ethanol (8 L x 4) for five days at room temperature.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & AChE inhibitory activity \\\\ compound & bioautography\\({}^{a}\\) & microplate\\({}^{b}\\) \\\\\n**1** & 0.75 & 13 ± 2.0 \\\\\n**2** & 0.18 & 30 ± 1.3 \\\\ rutin & \\textgreater{}100 & not tested \\\\ physostigmine\\({}^{c}\\) & 0.05 & 87 ± 0.1 \\\\ \\hline \\({}^{a}\\) Minimum amount required for inhibition of AChE on TLC plates (in \\(\\mu\\)g). \\({}^{b}\\) Percentage of AChE inhibition at 350 mM. \\({}^{c}\\) Positive control. \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: AChE Inhibitory Activity of Compounds **1** and **2** and **Rutin**\n\nFigure 1: Key gHMRC correlations for **1** and **2**.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation, yielding a thick syrup (210 g). The crude ethanol extract (100 g) was further reconstituted in MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O (4:1), filtered, and then partitioned with _n_-hexane (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 5), CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 4), EtOAc (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 4), and _n_-BuOH (250 mL \\(\\times\\) 2), successively. All phases were concentrated under reduced pressure. The CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) fraction (15.9 g) was dissolved in 500 mL of 5% HCl aqueous solution (ca. pH 2), filtered, and partitioned with EtOAc (50 mL \\(\\times\\) 3) to remove nonbasic components. Then, NH\\({}_{4}\\)OH (30%) was added to the aqueous phase until ca. pH 8.5 and partitioned with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) (50 mL \\(\\times\\) 5). The latter organic layer was washed with H\\({}_{2}\\)O (100 mL \\(\\times\\) 3) and concentrated in order to give a neutral alkaloid fraction (457 mg), which was purified by using preparative TLC with _n_-hexane\\(-\\)CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)\\(-\\)EtOAc (1.5: 2.0:6.5) as developing solvent (\\(\\times\\)2). The bands with _Rf_ values of 0.50 and 0.18 were scraped and eluted with MeOH, affording pure compounds **1** (49.1 mg) and **2** (60.5 mg). Fraction EtOAc (2.20 g) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-Cl\\({}_{8}\\) and eluted with MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O (5:95 to 100:0) to yield six fractions (EtOAc-F1 to EtOAc-F6). Fractions EtOAc-F2 and EtOAc-F3 (527 mg) were further purified by preparative HPLC on RP-Cl\\({}_{8}\\) and eluted with MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O (40:60, flow rate 19 mL/min, UV 254 nm), affording compound **3** (\\(\\mathrm{{}_{R}}\\) 17.4 min, 42.0 mg).\n\n**Bioautographic Assay.** The AChE inhibitory activity of pure compounds was determined using a TLC bioautographic assay as previously described.12 The TLC layers were spotted with **1** and **2** in a range from 0.09 to 6.00 _mg_ developed with _n_-hexane\\(-\\)EtOAc (1:4, v/v) and subsequently dried. The plates were then sprayed with the enzyme solution (6.66 U/mL), thoroughly dried, and incubated at 37 degC for 20 min (moist atmosphere). Enzyme activity was detected by spraying with a solution consisting of 0.25% of 1-naphthyl acetate in EtOH plus 0.25% aqueous solution of Fast Blue B salt. Potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appeared as clear zones on a purple-colored background. Electric eel AChE type V (product no. C 2888, 1000 U) and the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n**Microphatic Assay.** The AChE inhibitory activity of compounds **1**-**3 was evaluated using the modified methods of Ellman et al. and Rhee et al. in a 96-well microplate, as previously described.13 Using this method, the enzyme hydrolyzes the substrate acetylcholinesterase electrophitocholine, resulting in the production of thotocholine, which reacts with 5,5'-ditibiohs(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate\\(\\rightarrow\\)5-mercaptoethanolcholine and 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate and can be detected at 405 nm. To the 96-well plates were added 25 \\(\\mu\\)L of an aqueous solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (15 mM), 125 \\(\\mu\\)L of DTNB (3 mM) in buffer C, 50 \\(\\mu\\)L of buffer B, and 25 \\(\\mu\\)L of sample diluted in buffer A, to give a range of concentrations from 0.78 to 100 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s three times. Furthermore, 25 \\(\\mu\\)L of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme was added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min two times. Any increase in absorbance due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the rate of the reaction before the addition of the enzyme from the rate of the enzyme reaction. The percentage of inhibition was calculated in comparison to a blank (10% MeOH in buffer A), and a positive control of physposition was used in the same range of concentrations. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8); buffer B, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction; buffer C, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.10 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl\\({}_{2}\\)-6H\\({}_{2}\\)O.

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation.\n\nThe hexane extract from the roots of _C. fissilis_ (RH, 3.5 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70-230 mesh, 6x18 cm) using 1.5 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOHac, and MeOH. The dichromethene fraction (RHD, 384.1 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (70-230 mesh, 4x45 cm), eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (8:15:0.5) to give 9 fractions. Fraction 2 (RHD-2, 290.5 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 3x40 cm), using hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (8:15:0.5) to yield compound **19** (28.0 mg). Several column chromatographs on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 4x40 cm), eluent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) and Sephaker LH-20 (3x50 cm, eluent MeOH) of the acetate ethyl fraction (RHA, 704.8 mg) allowed the isolation of the triterpene **18** (11.5 mg).\n\nThe dichromethene extract from roots (RD, 10.9 g) was fractionated through column chromatography on silica gel (70-230 mesh, 4x45 cm), eluting with hexane to MeOH, to afford nine fractions. Limonoid **1** (12.1 mg) was obtained from fraction 5 (RD-5, 143.0 mg) through three successive chromatography columns on silica gel (70-230 and 230-400 mesh, 3x40 cm) and gradient elution (hexane to MeOH and hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1). Fraction 6 (RD-6, 192.0 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 3x50 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1) to yield compounds **3** (1.3 mg) and **10** (1.1 mg). The dichromethene extract from leaves (LD, 20.9 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70-230 mesh, 6x18 cm) using 2 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The dichromethene fraction (LD-D, 6.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh) and florisil (1:1, 4.5x50 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane to MeOH) to afford 12 fractions. From fraction 4 (LD-D, 4.12 g), after two column chromatographs on silica (70-230 mesh, 4x45 cm, eluent hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3:5:0.5) and HPLC on silica Hyper-sil 5 mm column (1*29 cm), with hexane-2-propanol (8:5.15) isocratic elution and UV detection at 240 nm, limonoid **2** (5.1 mg) was isolated. Fraction 7 (LD-D', 800.3 mg) was chromatographed twice on silica gel (70-230 mesh, 3x45 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3.5:0.5) to yield compound **5** (3.5 mg). The chromatographic separation of fraction 9 (LD-D-9, 1.0 g) by column chromatography (silica gel 70-230 mesh, 3x35 cm, eluent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 7:2:1) and normal HPLC (Hypersil 5 mm column, 1x29 cm, hexane-2-propanol 9:1, UV detection at 220 nm) afforded limonoids **4** (9.3 mg) and **6** (4.5 mg). The methanol extract from stems (SM, 40.0 g) was submitted to liquid-liquid partition chromatography with hexane-MeOH2O, CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O, EOAc-MeOH-H2O, and _n_-butanol-MeOH-H2O. The hexane and dichromethene fractions (SM-HD, 11.8 g) were chromatographed on Sephaker LH-20 (4x50 cm) using CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1) as eluent to give 10 fractions. Several chromatographic procedures on silica (230-400 mesh, 4x40 cm) and cromatotron of fraction 2 (SM-2, 2.3 g), using both isocratic (hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3.5:0.5) and gradient elution (CH2Cl2-until MeOH), allowed the isolation of **7** (35.6 mg), **8** (40.2 mg), and **14** (32.7 mg). Fraction 4 (SM-4, 3.5 g) was submitted to two column chromatographies on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 4x45 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9:5:0.5) and cromatotron, with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3:1). elution, to afford 11 (33.5 mg) and **12** (23.1 mg). Compounds **9** (10.1 mg) and **13** (13.2 mg) were obtained from fraction 7 (SM-7, 2.1 g) through column chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 4x40 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9:5:0.5) and cromatotron (eluent hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3:1).\n\nThe dichromethene extract from fruits (FD, 5.0 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 6x18 cm) using 1.5 L of CH2Cl2, EtOHac, and MeOH. The ethyl acetate fraction (FDA, 3.0 g) was submitted to column chromatography on silica gel (70-230 mesh, 4x45 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) to yield 7 fractions. Fraction 2 (FDA-2, 715.0 mg) was twice chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 3x40 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1) to afford compounds **16** (36.5 mg) and **17** (25.9 mg). The triterpene **15** (4.3 mg) was obtained through column chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 15x20 cm, eluent hexane-EtOAc, 7:3) and Sephadex LH-20 (1.5x30 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 1:1) from fraction 3 (FDA-3, 633.2 mg). Finally, the flavonoid **20** (48.9 mg) was isolated from the methanol extract from fruits (FM) through several column chromatographies on silica gel (230-400 mesh, 3x35 cm, eluent hexane until MeOH) and Sephadex LH-20 (1.5x30 cm, eluent MeOH).\n\n### Bioassay\n\nThe procedure for _in vitro_ assays on blood trypanasigote forms of _T. cruzi_ was previously described by Ambrozin et al. [10]. Diethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to prepare standard solutions of the crude extracts and compounds, which were added to the infected mouse blood to provide concentrations of 4 mg/ml and 50, 100, and 250 mg/ml, respectively. The final concentration of DMSO was 1% (v/v). The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) that were incubated at 4 degC for 24 h. The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (mmol/L) for pure compounds were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nIn the present work, we assessed the trypanacid activity of 15 extracts from fruits, branches, stems, roots and leaves of _C. fissilis_. The results, which are summarized in **Table 1**, showed that 11 extracts (73%) were significantly active (lysis% >= 50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypanosigote forms of _T. cruzi_. Moreover, nine of them presented lysis in the 60-80% range; the dichromethene extract of roots (RD) was the most active, reducing the number of parasites in the infected blood by 97.4%. Such results suggest that _C. fissilis_ is really a promising source of trypanoidal compounds, as we expected from the previous works that had reported the antiprotozoan action of Melicace plants [10], [14], [16], [17], [18]. Thus, we carried out the chemical investigation of _C. fissilis_ with the aim to isolate the compounds from some active extracts (RD, LD, FD, and SM), and one inactive extract (RH). This work allowed the isolation of the limonoids (**Fig. 1**):\n\n## Page 3\n\n\\(3\\beta\\)-acetoxycarapin (1) [19], 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (2) [20], gedunin (3) [20], photogedunin (4), methyl anglonsate (5), and 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (6) [20]; the triterpenes: bisploid A (7), piscidnl A (8), pentad (9), nilocetin (10), odoratol (11), iso-odoratol (12), odoratocon (13), 225,3a-dihydrotriuxi-24-dien-23-one (14), 311-dioxoolean-12-en-28-onic acid (15), oleanic acid (16) [19], oleanic acid (17) [19], and 24-methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-one (18); the sequierreten cripricotrimol (19); the flavonoid _ent_-catechin (20); in addition to the steroids _b_-sitosterol, stigmatero1, campestered, sitostenone, and 3_b_-O-b-glucopyranosidestosterol.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\na dihydroxytetrahydrofuran seem to enhance the trypanocalid activity of trivellanene triterpenes. So, odoratol (**11**) and iso-odoratol (**12**) showed higher activity than hisipid A (**7**) and odoratone (**13**). On the other hand, odoratone (**13**) was more active than bisicidol A (**8**).\n\nIn general, oleanane-type triterpenes (**15-17**) were more active than limonoids (**1-4**), but less active than trivellanene triterpenes (**7-13**). They were isolated from the active dichloromethane extract from fruits of _C. fissilis_ (FD, 75.4%) together with photogorbunin (**4**). Among them, oleanolic acid (**17**) showed the highest activity displaying an IC50 value of 80.4 \\(\\mu\\)M, which is near to the one observed for gentian violet [21]. It seems that for this class of compounds the trypanocalid activity is related to the presence of a hydroxy group at C-3. This observation corroborates the statement by Cunha et al [21], [22] that the free hydroxy at C-3 and the polarity of C-28 are the most influential structural features for the in vitro trypanocalid activity of oleanane triterpenes. Besides anti-inflammatory, immunomodulator-ry, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimutagenic, antiheterotoxic, anti-diabetic, hemolytic, antiviral and antibacterial activity [23], the tryppancidal action of oleanane triterpenes has already been described previously [21], [22], [24], [25], [26]. Actually, oleanolic acid (**17**) showed trypanocalid activity on both trypomastigote [21], [25] and epimastigote forms [24], [26] of _T. cruzi_.\n\nMexicanolide and geduin-type limonoids (**1-4**) showed low trypanocalid activity. In a previous work, mexicanolide limonoids displayed only weak activity on trypomastigote forms of _T. cruzi_[14].\n\nThese results suggest that trivellanane-type triterpenes are a promising class of new trypanocal compounds. The high trypanocal activity of odoratol (**11**) (100% at 100 \\(\\mu\\)m/mL) indicates that it has potential as an alternative for the chemoprophylactic gentian violet, which has many side effects [2]. However, toxicity assays have not been performed for **11** yet.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study showed that _C. fissilis_, a plant from the Melicaceae family, is a promising source of active compounds for control of Chagas' disease. Specifically, we demonstrate the potential activity of trivellanane and oleanane-type triterpenes. The high activity of odoratol (**11**) is promising although it asks for further optimization and for assessment of toxicity.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Fessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES) and Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) for the financial support.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] World Health Organization (WHO).

SILVA\\(\\dagger\\)*\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n_Styrax camporum_ Pohl (Styracaceae), known in Brazil as \"estoraque do campo\" or \"cuia de brejo\", grows in the States of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais and is popularly used in gastrointestinal diseases [1]. Its reported uses have led to a study of the composition and antiulcer activity of the crude extract of the bark and the trunk [2]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the bark of _S. camporum_ has resulted in the isolation of homoegonol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, sitosterol, vanillin and esters of cinnamic and ferulic acids [3]. The present article deals with the isolation from stems of _S. camporum_, and the identification and cytotoxicity evaluation of two benzofuran lignans, egonol (**1**) and homoegonol (**2**), and one furofuran lignan, (\\(\\pm\\))springaresinol (**3**),\n\n## Page 4\n\noriginally isolated from _Styrax obassia_[4, 5] and _Forsythia intermedia_[6], respectively. Lignans are known to possess several biological activities [7-11], including antitumor, e.g., some podophyllotoxin derivatives, currently in clinical use, and cytotoxic, e.g., the benzofuran lignan licarin A which is active against KB cells. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compounds **1-3** against C6, Hep-2 and HeLa human carcinoma cells, the MTT spectrophotometric assay was used.\n\n## 2 Experimental\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe stems of _S. camporum_ Pohl were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guacu, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen (Young 07 - SP) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. 1H, 13C-NMR, DEPT and COSY spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-D6 using TMS as internal standard on a Bruker AC 200 or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS, on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. CC was performed over silica gel 60, 70-230 or 230-400 mesh or Sephadex LH-20 (Merck). TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and/or by spraying with 2% anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe dried and powdered stems of _S. camporum_ (470.0 g) were extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue (57.2 g) was taken up in aqueous MeOH (MeOH-H2O 80 : 20; 200 mL) and subsequently extracted with hexane. Sufficient water was added to the aqueous methanol fraction to make it up to 60% aqueous MeOH, which was extracted with CHCl3 followed by EtOAc. The CHCl3 fraction (3.8 g) was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane-EtOAc 1 : 1 v/v (A), CHCl3 (B), EtOAc (C), CHCl3-CH3OH 1 : 1 v/v (D), MeOH (E) and H2O (F) (300 mL each). After evaporation, fraction A (370 mg) was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (98 : 2) and 62 fractions (15 mL each) were collected. Combined fraction 6-15 afforded **1** (34.3 mg, CHCl3-MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.26) and the combined fraction 17-18 afforded **2** (11.7 mg, CHCl3-MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.50). Fraction C (630 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 19 fractions (10 mL each) were collected. Combined fractions 2-7 (363 mg) were rechromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 52 fractions (3 mL each) were collected. Purification of the combined fractions 31-41 (98 mg) by prep. TLC (eluent CHCl3-MeOH 92 : 8) yielded **3** (5.1 mg, CHCl3-MeOH\n\n## Page 5\n\n85 : 15, Rf 0.61). All known compounds were identified with the help of UV, IR, MS and NMR, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nCellular viability in the presence and absence of test compounds was determined using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, Dorset, U.K.) microculture assay [12]. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase reduces MTT to a blue formazan product with an absorbance at 560 nm in DMSO. Cells harvested in the log phase of the growth were counted and seeded (5 x 104 cells/well in 1 mL) in 48-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37degC under 4.3% CO2 to allow cell attachment, cultures of the Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were treated with several test compound concentrations. Three replicate wells were set up for each experimental condition. After another 24 h incubation period, MTT (100 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution) was added, the plate was incubated for 3 h and unreduced MTT was removed. Acid isopropanol (HCl 0.3%; 100 mL) was added to dissolve the blue formazan. The absorbance at 560 nm was read by using a Pharmacia LKB-Ultrospec III spectrophotometer. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of test compound \n\n## Page 6\n\nresulting in a 50% reduction of absorbance compared to untreated cells in the MTT assay. Absorbances taken from cells grown in the absence of drugs were taken as 100% cell survival (control). For each compound the percent viability was plotted against concentration and the IC50 (concentration required to reduce viability by 50%) values were calculated for the three cell lines. This experiment was also performed with a positive control anticancer agent: streptonigrin.\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\nThe isolated lignans: egonol, homoegonol and (+-) syringaresinol were evaluated for their cytotoxicities by the MTT method in the three cell lines: Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma). Each compound was tested at five different concentrations. The concentration-response curves thus generated were used to calculate the IC50 (table 1).\n\nThe cytotoxic activity was expressed in terms of relative absorbance of drug-treated cells, in comparison to control cells. The results show a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect relationship for all the lignans and all the cell lines evaluated. Significant activities (IC50 < 10 mg/mL) could be observed for egonol against C6 and Hep-2 cell lines and for homoegonol against C6 and HeLa cells, when compared to the positive control streptonigrin activity (table 1). The activity of egonol against HeLa cells, homoegonol against Hep-2 cells as well as the activity of syringaresinol, the only furofuran neolignan under investigation in this study towards the three cell lines were moderate. It is interesting to note the significant differences of activity related to the lignan structure.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo) and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - Brazil) for financial support of this work, and fellowships to H.L.T., J.P.H., P.M.P. and J.R.C.P.\n\n## References\n\n* Manual de identificacao e cultivo de plantas arboreas nativas do Brasil_, Vol. 1, p. 332, Instituto Plantarum de Estudos da Flora, Sao Paulo (1982).\n* [2] E.M.

The sample was dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure, dissolved in 4.0 ml of methanol and filtered through 0.22 mm membrane filter (PVDF Millipore(r)) into a _high performance liquid chromatography_ (HPLC). Val. The reference standard used in this work-casegrewin F and caseinum(r)--was purified and identified in the laboratories of Nucleo de Bioensaios, Biossinstee e Ecofisologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sao Paulo State University, Aaraquara, Brazil; for details see Santos _et al._ (10). The standard solutions were prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of caseinregwein F into a volumetric flask. After diluting with methanol, the standard solutions (0.0079, 0.0159, 0.0635, 0.2540 e 0.5080 mg/ml) were filtered through 0.22 mm membrane filter (PVDF Millipore(r)) into a HPLC vial before injections. Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Variany Proxst system (comprising a model 240 pump, a 140 autosampler and a 330 photodiode array detector), with control and data handling managed by Star50 Chromatography software. Analysis was conducted using a Phenomerex(r) Gemini C-18 column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 um) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile: methanol water (from 44:23:4 to 47:53:00, v/v, in 42 min) and acetonitrile: methanol (53:47), v/v, in 5 min); flow rate 0.8 ml/min; detection range 210-400 nm; injection volume 20 ml. Analysis was realized in triplicate.\n\n### Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis\n\nA 5.0 mg of dried extract was submitted to SPE (2 x 1 cm) from silica gel (60-200 mm; Merck(r):) activated charcoal (Synthe(r)) (1:1, w/v) eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate (95:05, v/v, 5.0 ml). The sample was dried and diluted in hexane to afford 1.0 mg/ml solution. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector using a DB-5 column (30 mx 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm). The carrier gas was He at a flow rate of 1.33 ml/min, split mode with ratio of 1:20 and injection volume of 1 ml. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 250degC, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 60degC, with an increase of 3degC/min, to 240degC. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted using the same system and conditions interfaced to a mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an ion trap detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The compounds were identified by their retention indexes, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes (11) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7.0 library and of the literature (11). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas.\n\n### \\({}^{1}\\)H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis\n\nDried extract was diluted in CDCl3 (50.0 mg/ml) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA(r) 500 11.4 T instrument with CHCl3 as internal standard.\n\n### Ethanolic extract emulsions\n\nThe ethanolic extract of _C.slyestris_ was dissolved in Tween 20 (20%). Ball-C male mice were treated with 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. The concentrations of the test were chosen based on the high solubility of the ethanolic extract in the Tween 20 (20%).\n\n### Purification and structure determination of casegrewin F\n\nDried and powdered leaves of _C.slyestris_ were extracted by stepping in ethanol. The dried extract obtained was separated by SPE on silica gel: activated charcoal and fraction SPE was separated further by normal-phase low-pressure column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. Fractions CC15-19 were purified by preparative reversed-phase (Cl3) HPLC to yield casegrewin F (850.0 mg). The structure of the compound was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. For details see Santos _et al._ (10). The Microfluidic purify of the caasgrewin F in the assays used was 98.6% (HPLC-UV detected at 235 nm).\n\n### Caseagrewin F emulsions\n\nCaseagrewin F (Figure 1) was emulsified in 6% Tween 80 for both assays in mice. The Ball-C male mice were treated with 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg of casegrewin F per kg body weight (D-w.). These concentrations were based on ethanolic extract from _C.slyestris_ in which doses of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. were used; since casegrewin F represents 4% of the ethanolic extract, we selected doses that are ~4% of the ethanolic extract doses.\n\n### Animals\n\nSix-week-old Ball-C male mice were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (22 +- 2degC) and humidity (55 +- 10% room humidity), in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized for 1 week, during which they had free access to a commercial diet (Purina(r)) and water. The study was conducted with approval of Brazilian Ethics Committee to Experimentation Animals (process CEP/FCF/CAr ndeg 01/2006).\n\n### Mutagenic chemical-Positive control\n\nCyclophosphamide (CP, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, Lot. No. 036K1225, purity 99%) was used as mutagenic agent in experiments. CP was diluted in 0.95x NaCl just before use and the animals were exposed to the chemical by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg b.w. in 0.3 ml.\n\n### Mutagenicity--MN test\n\n### Experimental design\n\nThe assays were performed using eight animals/group. Group 1 (negative control) mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection of 0.3 ml. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and was treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%). 0.6 ml by gavage, for 2 weeks and on day 15 the mice were injected i.p. with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl. Groups 4-9 were treated for 2 weeks by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with various concentrations of ethanolic extract (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) or casegrewin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.). These groups also received treatment with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl by ip on day 15. Bone marrow from each animal was collected 24 h after the last administration (12).\n\nThe bone marrow MN test was carried out as described by Schmid (13). All slides were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and coded to avoid observer bias. For each experiment point, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were scored to determine the percentages of micronucleated PCE. The ratio of PCEs to monochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) (PCEs/NCEs) was determined in 200 cells.\n\n### Genotoxicity--comet assay\n\nFor the comet assay, the experimental design was the same as for the MN test in mice. Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized capillary vials and kept on ice until use. The alkaline version of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) was performed as described by Singh (14). Briefly, 20 ml of blood was taken, homogenized with low-melting point agarose, spread on microscope slide pre-coated with normal melting point agarose and covered with a coverslip. After 5 min at 4degC, the coverslip was removed from slides and they were immersed in cold lysing solution (2.4 M NaCl: 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). 10 mM Tris, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 1% Triton-X, pH 10) for 24 h. After lysis, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber, covered with electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH plus 1 mM EDTA, pH 7-13) and left for 20 min for the DNA to unwind. The electrophoresis was run for 20 min (25 V and 300 mA), after which the slides were submerged for 15 min in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and fixed in 96% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were prepared in duplicate with ethidium bromide and 50 cells were screened per sample in a fluorescent microscope (ZEISS(r), Germany) equipped with an excitation filter of 515-560 nm, a barrier filter of 590 nm and a 40 objective. The level of\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structure of caseagrewin F.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nDNA damage was assessed by an image analysis system (TriTek CometScore(tm) 1.5, 2006) and the percentage of DNA in tail was obtained.\n\n#### Antimagenicity--MN test\n\n_Experimental design_ In Group 1 (negative control), mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and were treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with 0.6 ml Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%) by gavage, for 2 weeks, and on day 15 received CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.); the aim of this group is to ensure that Tween has no influence in possible DNA protective effect. Groups 4-9 were treated by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with solutions of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) and casegrewin F (0.16, 32.0, 6.3, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 2 weeks and, on day 15, CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p) was administered. Bone marrow was taken 24 h of CP after the injection (12). The MN test was performed as described previously for the mutagenicity assays.\n\n#### Antigonotoxicity--comer assay\n\nThe experimental design for the Comet assay was the same as for antimutagenicity MN test and the comet assay for antimuotoxicity was carried out as described for the genotoxicity assay. Recently, Collins _et al_. (15) described that when comet assay is performed in _in vivo_ experiments low concentrations of genotoxic agents are unlikely to induce significant cytotoxicity, they also affirm that a low comet assay DNA damage would be a better indicator that cells are alive than common cytotoxicity tests. In this context, to the comet assay we did not performed cytotoxicity test once at low concentrations, the compounds were not genotoxic and consequently did not present cytotoxicity that could influence in antigenotoxicity assay.\n\n#### Statistical analysis\n\nFor a statistical interpretation, results were analyzed with Sigma Stat 3.5, Systat, CA. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test data for normal distribution, in all assays performed in the study. Since the results did not a show normal distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. In mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays, the Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test was used to compare DNA damage with the negative control. In the MN test, the PCE/NCE ratio was evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis test. In antimutagenicity/antigenotoxicity assays, Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test was used to compare all groups tested with the Tween 20 (20%) plus CP group, to assess the decrease in DNA damage. To test whether any groups demonstrated significant reduction in DNA damage to basal levels, those groups were also compared with negative control by the Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test.\n\n## Results\n\n### Identification of compounds in the extract\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum from extract showed signals with absorptions in d 1.98-2.09, 2.20-2.40, 3.43, 5.07-5.45, 6.25-6.75, similar to those described for casearins and other clerodane diterpenes isolated from _C.sylvestris_ (10,16-18). Both casearin U and caseargrewin F were identified in the extract. However, casearin U was not assayed in the present study. Quantitative High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector analysis demonstrated that the content of caseargrewin F in the extract was 40.0 mg/g. Additionally, the chromatogram (Figure 2) presented 29 peaks with UV spectrum similar to observed for casearins and caseargrewin F (\\(\\lambda_{\\max}=231\\)-236 nm). The results of chemical analysis suggest the presence of these clerodane diterpenes in the extract.\n\n#### Mutagenicity and genotoxicity--ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris\n\nThe results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) for ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ are shown in Table I. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were observed at 50 and 75 mg/kg (both \\(P\\) < 0.01). The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically significant variation, indicating that there was no cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow cells.\n\n#### Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris\n\nTable II shows the protective effect of the ethanolic extract from _C.sylvestris_ against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. Since Tween 20 (20%) was used to dissolve the ethanolic extract, in the vehicle control this solution was administered before the CP to ensure that it has no influence on the antimutagenic effect of the test group. Consequently, there is no difference between Tween 20 (20%) plus CP and positive control. When the protective effect was evaluated by the MN test, an antimutagenic effect was observed in mice treated with 6.25 (_P_ < 0.01) and 12.5 mg/kg (_P_ < 0.05). However, the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ did not reduce the DNA damage to the basal level. In the comet assay, the ethanolic extract from _C.sylvestris_ significantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 3.13 (_P_ < 0.01), 6.25 (_P_ < 0.01), 12.5 (_P_ < 0.05) and 25 mg/kg (_P_ < 0.05).\n\n#### Mutagenicity and genotoxicity--caseargrewin F\n\nThe results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ are shown in Table III. Clastogenicity and primary damage were observed at 3.8 mg/kg b.w. of caseargrewin F (both \\(P\\) < 0.05)\n\nFig. 2: Results from HPLC-DAD analysis. (**A**) Chromatogram of extract from the leaves of _Casearia syhestris_; asterisk (*) indicates peaks with UV spectrum similar to casearins and caseargrewin F.

The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically significant variation, indicating that caseargrewin F was not cytotoxic to mouse bone marrow cells.\n\n#### Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of caseargrewin F\n\nThe antimutagenesis/antigenotoxicity assays were performed to determine if caseargrewin F protects DNA from inducible damage (CP, 50 mg/kg b.w.). Table IV shows the protective effect of caseargrewin F against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. In the positive control, water was administered before CP, in order to maintain the same conditions as in the test groups (gavage intake) while determining the DNA damage induced by the CP without protection. To verify that Tween 80 has no influence on the antimutagenic effect in the test group, we administered the emulsifying solution before the CP. The negative control was used to check basal levels of DNA damage. The caseargrewin F did not show a statistically significant protective effect when assessed by the MN test. However, in the comet assay, it significantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 0.63 (_P_ < 0.01), 1.3 (_P_ < 0.01) and 2.5 (_P_ < 0.01) mg/kg b.w.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\ngenotoxic at the highest dose of 3.8 mg/kg b.w. A similar result was obtained in a recent study that describes mutagenic and genotoxic activity at high concentrations of another clerodane diterpene assessed by the MN test and comet assay (22). Considering that comet assay detects genomic lesions that are susceptible to DNA repair while MN test reveals more drastically lesions in chromosome level (23), it is important to realize that the two highest concentrations of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and at the high concentration case-argreiin F induced unrepairable DNA damage. A mutagenic effect of the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewini F could represent a potential antimuour property, as previous works on _C.sylvestris_ demonstrated strong antimuour activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (17) and its casearins (clerodane diterpenes) exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against V-79 tumour cells (18).\n\nInterestingly, in the comet assay, the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ was more efficient at preventing primary DNA damage at low concentrations (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). The molecules with non-mutagenic and/or antimutagenic properties could have antioxidant properties and, sometimes, may activate DNA repair pathways (24). They may act directly on the mutagenic process, by increasing the fidelity in DNA replication (desmutagens) or by stimulating DNA damage error-free repair (bio-antimutagenesis) (25). Additionally, ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ did not presented a dose-dependent response in both comet assay and MN test, and this result can be affected by various associated factors such as dependence of the effect of the substance on dose, the complexity of the test organism and the influence of simultaneous metabolic routes and enzymatic pathways (26). Caseargrewin F was not antimutagenic when assessed by the MN test, but showed an antigenotoxic dose-dependent response in the comet assay over the range of 0.63-2.5 mg/kg b.w. (Table IV).\n\nIn accordance with the present work, previous study has demonstrated that essential oil of _C.sylvestris_ has classetogenicity and anticlastogeneity in HTC cell line (27). Monoterpens and sesquiterpenes were identified in the essential oil (28) whereas in the present study, sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes were identified in the ethanolic extract. Among 15 sesquiterpenes identified in the ethanolic extract, 13 were previous identified in essential oil (11,28). The mutagenic and genotoxic activity as well as the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ could be related to the sesquiterpenes. Additionally, there are recent studies that describe sesquiterpenes as chemopreventive (27,29). However, we cannot exclude the potential biological effects of the clerodane diterpenes since caseargrewin F protected DNA from primary damage. Moreover, the use of mice instead of cell lines to assess protective effect of ethanolic extract could better verify absorption and metabolism of _C.sylvestris_ in a complex organism.\n\nRecently, natural products have been described to protect DNA from damage and cause DNA damage (30,31) as observed in the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F. Similar results were obtained in earlier studies and described these products as Janus compounds, referring to the mythological Roman god Janus, who had two faces in the same: one looking forward and the other backward (32). Comet assay also revealed that _C.sylvestris_ exhibited chemoprotective effects, but was not able to reduce the levels of DNA damage to negative controls values. Other studies suggested similar effects. Santos and Takahashi (33) demonstrated that selenomethionine, a selenium-derived antioxidant compound, was both genotoxic and antigenotoxic and reduced the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, but not to values as low as the negative control.\n\nCytotoxic events could lead to overestimation of the chemoprotective effects observed here. Thus, it is also important to consider that _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F did not exhibit cytotoxic effects alone neither in combination with the CP as observed in the PCE/NCE values. Likewise, the chemoprotective effects can be considered only in the concentrations that did not exhibit genotoxic effects, a recommendation of the publication of Zeiger (34). Thus, our results demonstrate that the benefits of using ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F as DNA protective compounds could be respectively safe at doses <50 mg/kg b.w. and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.\n\nWe conclude that the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F protects DNA against damage in low concentrations, which was carefully estimated by using MN test and comet assay. Keeping in mind that the same ethanolic extract and caseargrewin F also can cause DNA damage in high concentrations.\n\n## Funding\n\nFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) (2005/58472-9) to A.M.d.O.; Biota-FAPESP (2003/02176-7) to V.S.B; Biopropsecta (2004/07932-7) to D.H.S.S.; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento a Pesquisa (305615/2006-8) to C.P.S.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe wish to thank Maximino Antonio Boschi, Marcos Aparecido Dangona and Maria Izabel Feliciano for the excellent technical assistance.\n\nConflict of interest statement: None declared.\n\n## References\n\n- Gonzalez-Avila, M., Arriaga-Alba, M., de la Garza, M., del Carmen Hernandez Pretelin, M., Dominguez-Ortiz, M.

Five chromenes were isolated from _Piper gaudichaudianum_ and _P. aduncum_, and a further seven derivatives were prepared using standard reduction, methylation and acetylation procedures. These compounds were assayed _in vitro_ against optimastigative forms of _Typanosoma cruzi_, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The results showed that the most of the compounds, especially those possessing electron-donating groups as substituents on the aromatic ring, showed potent trypanocidal activity. The most active compound, [(2S)-methyl-2-methyl-8-(3\"-methyl-2\"-enyl)-2(4\"-methyl-3\"-enyl)-2_H_-chrome-6-carboxylate], was almost four times more potent than benzindazole (the positive control) and showed an IC50 of 2.82 _m_M. The results reveal that chromenes exhibit significant anti-trypanocidal activities and indicate that this class of natural product should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe flagellate protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, affects more than 18 million people in Latin America and is responsible for approximately 40000 deaths per year.1 Only two drugs are commercially available for the treatment of this disease, namely, nifurimax (a 2-nitrofuran derivative) and benzindazole (a 2-nitroimidazole acetamide). These drugs are, however, not consistently effective and, moreover, exhibit serious side effects including cardiac and/or renal toxicity.2 There is thus particular interest in the discovery of natural products that might be developed to generate safer and more efficient chemotherapeutic agents against _T. cruzi_.3\n\nA number of biologically-active chromenes have been isolated from species of the genus _Piper_, including the prenylated chromene **1** from _Piper gaudichaudianum_9 and chromenes **2--5** (Fig. 1) from _P. aduncum_.5 Whilst these chromenes have been shown to exhibit anti-fungal4 and anti-tumour properties,5 no evaluation has yet been made with respect to their activity against _T. cruzi_. The object of the present study was to examine a range of natural chromenes and chromene derivatives in order to determine their potential for further development to treat Chagas disease.\n\n## Methods and Results\n\n### General\n\nAll reagents were of analytical grade. For methylation reactions, an entered solution of diazomethane (30 ml) was prepared by dissolving 2.14 g of _N_-methyl-_N_-nitroso-_p_-toluenesulfuphonamide (Diazald; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 10.0 ml of ethanol containing 4.0% potassium hydroxide.6 Hydrogenation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium (3.0 or 10.0%) on activated charcoal (Acros Organics, New Jersey, U.S.A.) as catalyst.7 The acetylated chromene was prepared by treatment with acetic anhydride (20.0 ml) and pyridine (20.0 ml) overnight.8 Benzindazole, employed as positive control in the assays of trypanocidal activity, was obtained from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).\n\n### Plant Material\n\nSpecimens of _P. gaudichaudianum_ and _P. aduncum_ were cultivated from seed under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru) and voucher specimens (with codes Kato 0093 and 0057, respectively) were deposited at the Herbarium of the\n\nFig. 1: Structures of Chromenes Isolated from _Piper gaudichaudianum_ (**1**), _P. aduncum_ (**2—5**) and Chrome Derivatives (**6—12**)\n\n## Page 2\n\nInstitute of Bioscience, USP, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.\n\n**Isolation of Chromenes and Preparation of Derivatives** Compounds **1** and **2--5** (Fig. 1) were isolated from stems of _Piper gaudichaudianum_ and leaves of _P. aduncum_, respectively, according to previously published methods. [4, 5] Various reduced, methylated and acetylated derivatives of chromenes **1** and **3--5** (Fig. 1) were prepared using standard methods, under room temperature.

For the statistical analysis, method of probits was employed.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nAs part of an on-going screening program for new anti-chagasic drugs, the prenylated chromene [(2_S_)-2-methyl-8-(3deg-methylbut-2deg-enyl)]-2-(4deg-methylpent-3deg-enyl)-2_H_-chromene-6-carboxylic acid] (**1**), the major metabolite of the ethanolic extract of _Piper gaudichaudianum_,4 was evaluated with respect to its toxicity against epimastigotes of _T. cruzi_ and exhibited a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 value of 33.8 _m_m. On the basis of this finding, the natural benzopyrans **2--5** (isolated from _P. aduncum_) were assayed for trypanocidal activity together with some novel chromene derivatives obtained from **1**, **3**, **4** and **5** by simple chemical transformations. Specifically, hydrogenation7 of the isoprene units and of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring of **1** produced the derivative **6**. The benzopyran ester **7** was obtained from **1** by methylation with diazomethane,6 and this ester was subsequently reduced to **8** by catalytic hydrogenation. Similarly, derivatives **9** and **10** were obtained from chromenes **3** and **4**, respectively, whilst derivative **11** was obtained by selective hydrogenation of **5**. Finally the chromene **4** was acetylated to **12**.\n\nMost of the isolates together with their derivatives showed significant trypanocidal activities in comparison with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 10.3 _m_m). Compound **7** proved to be the most active with an IC50 value of 2.82 _m_m, _i.e._ almost four times more potent than benznidazole.\n\nAll compounds that showed activity possessed electron-donating substituents. Within this group the prenylated compounds **1**, **5**, **7** and **11** were the most active, whilst the ester derivative **7** (containing two premyl units) was an extremely powerful trypanocidal agent with a potency _ca._ 10-fold greater than that of the corresponding acid. This finding suggests that both premyl and ester substituents are necessary for the strongest anti-parasitic activity. The lower activity exhibited by chromene **2** compared with **3** corroborates the importance of an ester group, and indicates a direct correlation between the electronic nature of the substituents and trypanocidal activity. Moreover, the observed reduction in activity of **12** occasioned by the introduction of an electron-withdrawing acetyl group at C-8 following acetylation8 of **4**, substantiates the influence of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1).\n\nReduction of the double bonds of the premyl substituents (as in derivatives **6** and **8**) gave rise to a significant decrease in toxicity indicating their essential role in trypanocidal activity. Furthermore, reduction of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring (as in derivatives **9** and **10**) resulted in the total loss of toxicity suggesting that a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring is essential for trypanocidal activity. These results suggest that substituents on the aromatic ring that contribute to an increase in lipophilicity are also required for activity (Table 1).\n\nIn conclusion, several natural chromenes from _P. gaudichaudianum_ and _P. aduncum_, along with a series of semi-synthetic derivatives, have been shown to exhibit potential trypanocidal activities against epimastigotes of _T. cruzi_. The results suggest that chromenes should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"isolationType\": \"Plant Isolated\"}, {\"isolationType\": \"Semisynthesis Product\"}]"}]}

Among the plant families studied, Meliaceae and Rutenceae are perhaps the most promising (Schoonhoven, 1982), at least partly due to the presence of limonoids and triterpenoids characteristic of the Rutales order. The biological activity of limonoids from Rutales has been reviewed (Champagne _et al._, 1992). Some neem-based botanical insecticides have already been developed and marketed (Schmutterer, 1990, 1995, 2005).\n\n_Carapa guianensis_ Aublet, also called andiroba, andiroba-saruva, iandirova, carapa, and nanofiba (Lorenzi and Matos, 2002), is a tall Meliaceae tree growing wild throughout South America, West India, and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in flooded areas of the Amazon rainforest (Ambrozin _et al._, 2006). From the nuts of this plant an oil, called andiroba oil, is extracted, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and as an anticancer remedy (Bickii _et al._, 2000; Gilbert _et al._, 1999; MacKinnon _et al._, 1997; Moura _et al._, 2002). Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, together with 2\\(-\\)5% of unsaponifiable material. In addition, from several parts of _Carapa guianensis_ limonoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, flavonoids, and diglycerides have been isolated (Lavie _et al._, 1973; Marcelle and Moto, 1975; Ollis _et al._, 1964, 1970; Qi _et al._, 2003, 2004).\n\n_Cabralea canjerana_ (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae) (\"canjarana\") is a native tree of economic importance in Brazil. It is a dioecious tree with wide-spread distribution in the neotropics, extending from Costa Rica to southern Brazil and northern Argentina. According to Pennington _et al._ (1981), it inhabits mainly nonflooded evergreen lowland or lower hill rain forests.\n\nIn the present paper, triterpenoids and limonoids isolated from _C. canjerana_ and _C. guianensis_ were examined for their effects on the fall armworm, _Spodoptera frugiperda_ (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Notutiade). _S. frugiperda_ is a major pest of many crops in the Americas and one of the most important pests of tropical maize, causing up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity of this crop in Brazil (Cruz _et al._, 1996).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## Material and Methods\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Cabralea canjerana_ was collected at the Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil, and identified by T. D. Pennington from the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, UK. A voucher (1842; 1983) is deposited in the herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestal Dendrologia, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.\n\nThe arillus of the _Carapa guianensis_ seeds were supplied by Cognis Brasil Ltda., Av. Nacoes Unidas 10989, 4deg andar, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\n\n### Compounds isolation\n\nFruits (460 g) and seeds (200 g) from _C. canjerana_ were extracted with ethanol, at room temperature for three times. The ethanolic extract (88.3 g) of the fruits was submitted to liquid-liquid partition with 120 ml methanol/water (3:1, v/v) solution. This solution was partitioned with different solvents to give fractions in _n_-hexane (fr-Hex, 47.4 g), dichloromethane (fr-CH2Cl2, 5.4 g), ethyl acetate (fr-EtOAc, 4.4 g), and methanol (fr-MeOH, 11.9 g). The fraction fr-Hex (2.8 g) was submitted to a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 45 fractions of 50 ml) using _n_-hexane/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase, yielding nine fractions (fr-Hex.1 to fr-Hex.10) after TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2 (102 mg) was re-chromatographed by column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20 as stationary phase (column 3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., 26 fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol/dichloromethane, 1:1, v/v), yielding three fractions (fr-Hex.2.1 to fr-Hex.2.3) after comparison by TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2.2 (88.6 mg) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 3.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 10 fractions of 5 ml each) eluted with _n_-hexane/acetone (9:1, v/v) to afford octilolone (**1**, 16.3 mg) and carbaleadiol (**2**, 24.4 mg).\n\nThe ethanolic extract (14.3 g) of the seeds of _C. canjerana_ was chromatographed on microcrystalline cellulose-D and silica gel (column 5.0 x 22.0 cm i.d., fractions of 250 ml each) using _n_-hexane (250 ml) followed by dichloromethane (1 l), acetone (1 l), and methanol (1 l) as mobile phases yielding 13 fractions (EES-1 to EES-13). The fraction EES-2 (1.72 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 - 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 69 fractions of 10 ml each) using _n_-hexane/acetone/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase to yield eleven fractions (EES-2.1 to EES-2.11) which were joined based on TLC. The fraction EES-2.6 (293.4 mg) was rechromatographed by column chromatography using a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol), yielding fifteen fractions (EES-2.6.1 to EES-2.6.15). The fraction EES-2.6.7 afforded methyl anglopensate (**3**, 48.2 mg). The fraction EES-2.7 (230.6 mg) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 35 fractions of 10 ml each), using _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as mobile isocratic phase, yielding seventeen fractions (EES-2.7.1 to EES-2.7.17). The fraction EES-2.7.9 afforded 3-_b_-deacetylfissinolide (**4**, 63.7 mg).\n\nThe arillus ethanolic extract (10.0 g) of _C. guianensis_ was submitted to vacuum chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase (70-230 mesh, column 30 x 5 cm i.d.) and _n_-hexane followed by CH2Cl2, EtOHAc, and MeOH (1 l each) as mobile phases, yielding four fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (3.8 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 30 x 4 cm i.d., _n_-hexane and acetone gradient as eluent, starting with pure _n_-hexane and finishing with pure acetone, 32 fractions of 200 ml each) to give five fractions (Ac1 to Ac5). The fraction Ac3 (3.0 g) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 10 x 3 cm i.d.) eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2 to MeOH, 28 fractions of 50 ml each) to yield ten fractions (Ac3.1 to Ac3.10). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**, 24.4 mg) and _b_-photogedunin (**6**, 14.4 mg) were isolated from fraction Ac3.2 by recycling HPLC (Asahipack polymeric column; eluent, methanol/dichloromethane, 7:3, v/v; flow, 4 ml min-1).\n\n### Biological activity\n\nLarvae of _Spodoptera frugiperda_ (J. E. Smith) were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Laboratory of Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil, and reared on semi-artificial diets (Kasten _et al._, 1978; Parra, 1986). They were maintained in an incubation chamber with a photoperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark, (70 +- 5)% relative humidity, and (25 +- 1) degC.\n\nFor each treatment and control, 30 neonate larvae of _S. frugiperda_ were used. A solution of compound was added to ascorbic acid (1.56 g; an\n\n## Page 3\n\ningredient of the diet). After evaporation of the solvent, the mixture was incorporated into the semi-artificial diet in which bean and wheat germ are the basic ingredients (Kasten _et al._, 1978) at final contents of 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg kg-1 for 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**), and 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg-1 for coctillone (**1**), cabraleadiol (**2**), methyl angolensate (**3**), 3-_b_-deacetylfissinolide (**4**), and _b_-photogedunin (**6**). The diet for the control was prepared similarly but without the triterpenoids or limonoids. Gedunin (**7**) was used as positive control. The diets were placed in previously sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm x 2.5 cm), into which larvae of _S. frugiperda_ were introduced individually. The pupae were weighed 1 d after pupation and were transferred to plastics cups, where they stayed until the emergence of adults. Daily observations were made and the following parameters were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal phases, (2) weight of pupae, and (3) percentage of dead insects (mortality) at the end of each phase.\n\n### Statistics\n\nData were submitted to an analysis of variance ANOVA (Zar, 1974), and the averages were compared applying the Tukey test (_P_ <= 0.05). Each tube containing one insect, independent of the developed phase, was considered as one replicate, therefore, the number of replicates was different for each treatment. For evaluation of the mortality of the larvae and pupae, the experimental unit was constituted by the mean of five tubes containing one larva each, with six replications by treatment.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe triterpenoids **1** and **2** and limonoids **3** and **4** were isolated from the fruits and seeds of _C. canjerana_ and the limonoids **5** and **6** from the arilulus of _C. guianensis_ (Fig. 1). Their structures were confirmed by 1H and 15C NMR spectroscopy and comparison with data from the literature (Braga _et al._, 2006; Ambrozin _et al._, 2006).\n\nCompounds **1**-**6** were incorporated in the semi-artificial diet. **2**, **4**, and **5** affected larval development (Table 1), and only **6** affected pupal development at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg [(8.5 +- 1.64) days and (8.9 +- 1.25) days, respectively, control (10.1 +- 1.45) days]. Larvae fed with\n\nFig. 1: The triterpenoids coctillone (**1**) and cabraleadiol (**2**), and the limonoids methyl angolensate (**3**), 3-_β_-deacetylfissinolide (**4**), 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**), and _β_-photogedunin (**6**) isolated from _Carapa guianensis_ and _Cabralea canjerana_, and of gedunin (**7**).\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nsemi-artificial diet treated with **5** and **6** showed significant reduction in the pupal weight (17.8 and 31.5 mg at 50 mg kg-1, respectively), comparable to the effect of gedunin (**7**, 27.2 mg, Table I). Larvae fed with semi-artificial diet treated with **2**, **4**, and **5** at 50.0 mg kg-1 prolonged the larval time for approximately 1.2 days similar to gedunin, suggesting that these compounds act as larval growth inhibitors (Table I).\n\nCompounds **2** and **4** prolonged the larval phase, although no alteration in pupal weight was observed. Tanzubil and McCaffery (1990) observed that larvae treated with low doses of azadirachtin produced pupae with a weight comparable to that of the controls, suggesting that they did not experience any severe feeding inhibition.\n\nCompound **5** also effected prolongation of the larval phase followed by reduction of the pupal weight. The larvae treated with **5** showed prolongation of the larval phase by 1.4 days (at 50.0 mg kg-1) and 2.6 days (at 100.0 mg kg-1) when compared with the control (14.9 days, Table I). The reduction of the pupal weight was by 17.8 and 25.8 mg at 50.0 and 100.0 mg kg-1, respectively, when compared with the control (262.5 mg, Table I).\n\nLarvae treated with **6** at 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg-1 presented reduction of the pupal weight by 30.0, 31.1, and 31.5 mg, respectively, when compared with the control (272.7 mg, Table I). This compound reduced the duration of the pupal phase by 1.2 days and that of the larval phase was increased by 0.6 days, while gedunin affected\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound or control & Content [mg kg−1] & Larval phase duration [d] (± SD)a & Pupal weight [mg]a & Larvae mortality (\\%)a \\\\\n**1** & 1 & 17.6 (± 1.25) a & 259.7 a & 10.0 b \\\\\n10 & 18.0 (± 1.72) a & 255.7 a & 16.7 b \\\\\n50 & 18.1 (± 1.43) a & 253.9 a & 40.0 a \\\\ Control & 17.4 (± 1.39) a & 260.8 a & 6.7 b \\\\\n**2** & 1 & 18.2 (± 1.61) ab & 271.7 a & 13.3 a \\\\\n\n## Page 5\n\nonly the larval phase by 1.3 days at 50 mg kg-1 (Table 1).\n\nOcotillone (**1**) isolated from the leaves of _Dysoxylum malabricum_ (Govindachari _et al._, 1994) was tested against _Spodoptera litura_ and showed excellent PFI (percentage feeding index) values comparable to those of azadiradione, epoxyazadriadione, and limonin (Govindachari _et al._, 1995).\n\nMethyl anologensate (**3**) exhibited insecticidal activity against _S. litura_ in no-choice tests (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh _et al._, 2002; Powel _et al._, 1991), and this result agrees with that observed in the present work. Isolated from diethyl ether and acetone extracts of the stem bark of _Khaya senegalensis_ (Meliaceae) **3** showed antidecatal activity by the conventional leaf disc method on the third-instar larvae of _Spodoptera littoralis_ (Boisd., Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at 500 \\(\\mu\\)g ml-1 (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh _et al._, 2002) in a study examining structure-insect antifeedant relationships of plants belonging to the Rutales order. In a dual-choice antifeedant bioassay against _Spodoptera litura_ L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), methyl anologensate (**3**) showed a PFI of 65.3, near to that of cedrelone (51.5). Two limonoids (sandoricin and 6-hydroxy-sandoricin) isolated from seed extracts of _Sandoricum koetjape_ Merr. (Meliaceae), which possess chemical structures similar to that of methyl anologensate (**3**), showed significant antifeedant activity against the fall armyworm (_S. frugiperda_), incorporated in diet at 25 ppm, and similar activity against the European corn borer (ECB), _Ostrinia nubilalis_ Hubner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), at 200 ppm. Toxicity results for both insects indicated that continued feeding on diets containing sandoricin or 6-hydroxysandoricin at the 200 ppm level would result in nearly 100% mortality prior to pupation (Powell _et al._, 1991).\n\nb-Photogedunin (**6**) presented the highest insecticidal activity against _S. frugiperda_ causing mortality of 53.3% in the larval stage and 20.0% in the pupal phase at 50 ppm. These results agree with those of Cespedes _et al._ (2000), who tested an epimeric mixture of photogedunin and their corresponding acetates and observed that these compounds caused significant mortality of _S. frugiperda_ larvae (45% to 100% at 10.0 to 52.0 ppm) after 7 days, as well as growth reduction, and photogedunin acetates showed the highest insecticidal activity at 10.0 ppm with 17% survival.\n\nCompounds **1**, **3**, **5**, and **6** showed moderate insecticidal activity at 50.0 mg kg-1 with 40.0, 40.0, 33.3, and 53.3% mortality, respectively, for the larval phase. Although the compounds tested here were less active than the positive the control gelatin (**7**, 63.3%), the use of these compounds, in particular **6**, is suggested for the control of _S. frugiperda_. Comparison of the activities of **6** and **7** suggests that oxidation of the furan ring led to a decrease in the insecticidal activity.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Controle Biorracional de Insetos Pragas, and Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) for the financial support and scholarships (CNPq).\n\nBraga P.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation from hexane extract of _Himatanthus succinuba_ barks utilizing _Cladsosporium sphareospermum_ led to the isolation of riridoids _plumeicin_ and _isoplumericin_, which showed higher inhibition against _C. sphaereospermum_ than the antibiotic nistatin. Besides bioactive tridoids were isolated the inactive triterpenes lupeol cinnamate, -amyrin cinnamate and lupeol acetate.**\n\n**Keywords:**_Himatanthus succinuba; tridoids; triterpenes._\n\n**INTRODUCAO**\n\n_Himatanthus succinuba_ (Spruce) Woodson (Apocynaceae) e uma planta conhecida na regio norte do Brasil como sucuuba, janaguba ou sucuba. Esta planta e amplamente utilizada na medicina popular como antitumoral, antifungica, vermifuga e anti-amenica'.\n\nEstudos anteriores revelaram a presenca de despisdeos, terpenos e riridoides em _H.sucuuba_2,3. Dentre os iridoides foram encontrados a fulvolumierina, isoplumericina e plumericina, de comprovada acao aintoposla, antifogistica e antimicrobia-10. Os despisdeos isolados de _H.sucuuba_ apresentaram atividade como inhibidores da enzima beta monoamino-oxidase (MAO-B)3. No entanto, como foram encontrados nas cascas podem nao ser provenientes da planta e sim de liquens infestantes.\n\nNo presente trabalba sao descritos os resultados do estudo fitotquinico do extrato hexanico das cascas do cauule de _H.sucuuba_. Este extrato e constituido basicamente por uma mistura de esteres triterpenicos, que corresponde aproximadamente a 7% do peso do extrato. Estes esteres triterpeneso ja foram descriptors no género _Himatanthus_11,12. Atividade fungicidal apresentada pelo extrato fon monitorado por bioautografia, utilizando-se o fungo fitpotapocino _Cladsosporium sphareospermum_11,13-14, A analise das fracoes bioativas por CGAR-EM, RMN 1H e 13C revolu a presencia dos irridoides plumericina **1** e isolumericina **2**.\n\n**RESULTADOS E DISCUSSAO**\n\nO extrato hexanico das cascas do caule foi subnetido a bioautografia, utilizando o fungo _Cladsosporium sphareospermum_. A cromatoplaca de silica foi eluida com uma mistura de hexano e acetato de etila (6:4). Uma zona de inibicao intensa aromatoplaca indicua a presencia de substancias fungicidalicas.\n\nO extrato hexanico foi fracionado em column de SEPHADEX-LH 20, usando hexano, dicloromenta, acetona e metal como eluentes. Das oito fracoes obtidas, a segunde e a tereira fracoes apresentaram zona de inibicao na bioautografia. A cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria de massas destas duns fracoes mostrou a presenca dos iridoides plumeicina **1**, isoplumericina **2**, e de uma mistura de esteres triterpenicos das series lupano e usrano, como constituunes em maior proporcao na mistura.\n\nAo extrato hexanico dissolvido em cloroforma adicionov-se et canetol. Este procedimento levou a obtenao de um solido amorfo que foi cromatografado em coluna de gel de silica. A eluicao da coluna com uma mistura de hexano/benzene em gradiente de polaridade crescente fornece um mistura de dues substancias e um solido cristalino. A analise da mistura, por cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria massas, mostrou o mesmo ion molecular de m/z 556 para as duas substancias, compueral com a formula molecular C3H5aO2.

St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani (Rutaceae) afforded new pyranoflavones along with the known compounds flavone, 7-methoxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, haplostusine, 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone alkaloid, b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and b-sitosterol benzoate. Their structures were established based on their spectral data. NMR data for the alkaloid INDIAMINA and the new pyranoflavones are described for the first time herein. These compounds were assayed on the tripmonsatiqute forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Among them, haplotusine and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone showed moderate values of IC50 136.9 and 144.9 uM, respectively.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nA doenca de Chagas, causada pelo protozoario _Trypanosoma cruzi_, e uma das mais graves endemias do Brasil. No Continente Americano, ela afeta 16-18 milhoes de individuos, sendo que 100 milhoes estao sob risco de contaminaacao.1\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nDevido a ampla distribuicao geografica desta doenca, a falta de tratamento eficza e seguro, e as graves manifestacoes clinicalas que ocasiona, a procura de novas substancias para a profilaxia e/ou tratamento desta emelia se faz necessaria.\n\nNeste contexto, as plantas sao valiosas fontes de novos compostos ativos e com baxica toxicidade.2 De fato, segundo un levantamento recente, 61% dos 877 novos farmacos desenvolvidos durante o periodo de 1981-2002 sao produtos naturais, ou substancias desenvolvidas a partir deles.3\n\nDe plantas da familia Rutaceae foram isolados alcaloides e lignanas com attividades triangucidas.4,5 Alem disso, as attividades sobre o _T. cruzi_ ou sobre sua enzima GAPDH (gliceraldedo 3-fosfatosdicofragase) de varios extratos e algumas substancias isoladas desta mesma familia foram determinadas.6,8\n\nFootnote 4: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nA especie _Conchocarpus heterophyllus_ (A. St.-Hil.) pertence a familia Rutaceae (ordem Rutales) e era anteriormente denominada de _Angostura heterophylla_ (A. St.-Hil.) Alb.9 Nenhum estudo fitoquimico sobre o genero cesorito na literatura. Erratumo, do genero _Angostura_ form isolados alcaloides acridonicos.10\n\nOs extratos e as fracoes de folhas e cuale de _C. heterophyllus_ apresentaram atividade sobre as formas tripmonsatigotas do _T. cruzi_.6 Neste trabalho sao descritos o isolamento, as atividades tripanocidas substancias obtidas de tais extratos/fracoes, assim como os dados de RMN do alcaloide haplotusina (**I**) e das piranoflavonas ineditas (**2**).\n\nFootnote 6: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\n## RESULTSADO\n\nO estudo quimico dos extratos e fracoes de folhas e cuale de _C. heterophyllus_, attivos sobre as formas tripmonstigotas de _T. cruzi_, permitu o isolamento de steroides, flavonas e alcaloides 2- e 4-quinolonics. A partir do extrato hexanico do caule de _C. heterophyllus_ foram isolados os esteroides b-sitosterol e estigmasterol;11 da fracao dicidomentaica proveniente de extrato hexanico das folhas, o benzoate de b-sitosterida12 e uma mistura de piranoflavonas ineditas (**2**) da fracao acetato de e tella deste mesmo extrato, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona3 e 5-hidrofilavona;4 de falrao acetato de e tella do extrato metanolico do caule, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona, haplotusina (**1**)15 e o alcaloide 2-fenil-1-metil-4-quinolona (**3**).16\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nTodas as substancias foram identificadas atraves da analise dos seus datos espectivocpicos e comparação com os da literatura.

The **1**-**6** were evaluated against the fungi C. _cladsosporioides_ and _C. spharosospermum_ and only **5** showed weak activity. The cytotoxicity _in vitro_ against HeLa and CHO cells lines were investigated and the cytochalasins **2-4**, and **6** showed a strong activity against HeLa. The DNAdamaging activity of **1**-**6** were also investigated against mutant strains of _S. cerevisiae_.\n\n**Keywords: _Xylaria_ sp.; _Piper aduncum_; endophytic fungus.\n\n**INTRODUCAO**\n\nAproximadamente um quarto de todos os produtos naturais biologicamente attivos conhecidos tem sido produzidos por fungos.1 Estes sao estimados em 1,5 milhoes de especies2 distribuidos principalmente entre fungos micoparasitas, coprofilos, de solo, de agua docc, epifiticos e endofificos. Fungos endofificos sao microorganisms que habitam o interior de um vegetal,1 em pelo menos por un periodo de seu cicio de vida. Apesar de seren productores de metabolites secundarios biologicamente attivos,4 sao pouco explorados.\n\nDando continuidade aos estudos de prospeccao quimica e biologica em fungos endofificos isolados de especies vegetais do cerrado, a espeice vegetal _Piper aduncum_ foi selecionada, pois a medicina popular relata proprietades diuretica, cicatrizante e anti-hemorradiecia.5.7 Dados fittopuimicos de _P. aduncum_ relata a coornercia de amidas, fenilproponoides, di-hidrochalcanos e derivados prenilados com atividades moluscida, bactericida e citotoxica.89 Estes fatos, associados as observacoes de que micro-organismos endofificos podem mimetizar a quimica de seus respectivos hospedeiros e produzirem substancias ou derivados com maior bioatividade,10 direcionaram o estudo quimico/biologico dos fungos endofificos associados a _P. aduncum_.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\ncom C-7 (d2 212,6) e comparacao com dados de citocalas-13(E),19(E)-dien-1,7,17-triona, 1possibilitarum a elucidacao do nucleo isiondolona. As correlacao e de H-22 (d8 1, 1,12) e H-23 (d8 1, 1,44) com C-17 (d2 214,9) e entre H-21 (d8 5, 43) e C-8 (d5 5, 12,2) e comparacao com 19,20-epoxico citocalasina C (3)3 (perimentiumelacao) and amercolico.\n\nAs configuracoes relativas do nucleo isiondolona e do anel macrociccico de **1** form estabelecidas pelo experimento NOESY, onde se observon correlacao entre H-4 e H-21, valores dos descendemo atomicos de RMN de 'H 'C, constantes de acoplamento e comparacao com 18,21-di-hidroix-16,18-dimetti-10-fenil-citolasas-13(E),19(E)-dieno-1,7,17-triona? e com 19,20-epoxicoitocalasina C (**3**),15 respectivamente, Figure 1. Estas informacoes permitam estabelecer a configuracao relativa da inedita citocalasina **1**.\n\nAs substancias **2-6** form identificadas pela analise por EM, RMN de 'H e '1C, gHMQC, gHMQC, gGOSY e NOESY e por comparacao com dados descritros na literatura.13\n\nAs citocalasinas **1-6** (Figure 1) foram availadas quanto atividade antifinicas, frente aos fungos ftopologicos _Cladosporium clados-poioides e C. sphaerospermum_, usando-se o metodo da autoibografia direta.14 A substancia **5** movetu uma fraca atividade na concentracao de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrao nistatina (1 mg mL 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentarum-se inativas.\n\nAs substancias **1-6** form ensaiadas frente a linhagem mutante de _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica nao serem as responsaveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15\n\nA avaliacao da attividade citorakica de **1-6** foi realizada em celulas de maniforacos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cervix humano) e CHO (ovario de hamster chines).16 Para a linhagem aao cancergerica CHO, as substancias **2**, **3**, **5** e **6** apresentam IC50, de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As ciocalasinas **1** e **4** nao apresentaram IC50 nas concentracoes testadas, sendo que **1** foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada com padrao com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1.\n\nNa linhagem cancerigena HeLa as substancias **1-6** apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente. A cisplatina foi usada com padrao com IC50 = 5,0 mmol L-1.\n\nA forte attividade apresentada pelas citocalasinas **2-5** contra a linhagem canerigena HeLa e a fraca contra a linhagen nao cancergica CHO evidenciam uma seletividade destas substancias para as infagens tumorais HeLa.\n\nPara o nosso conhecimento, este e o primeiro relato de citocalasinas sendo produzidas por fungos endofificos associados a _Piper aduncum_.\n\n## Parte Experimental\n\n### Instrumentacao\n\nOs espectros de absorcao na regiao do IV foram obtidos em um espectometro Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectometro de massas de baixa resolucao da marca Fisons, modelo VG Platform II, no modo de ionizacao _electrospray_ (ESI). Os espectros\n\nFigure 1: _Estruturas das substancias isoladas de Xylaria sp._\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nde massas de alta resolucao foram obtidos em espectrometro QTOF (Micromass), utilizando-se como metodo de ionizacao _electrospray_ no mode positivo.\n\nOs espectors de RMN form registrados em CDCli e DMSO-_d__o_ no espectrometro Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrao de referencia.\n\nO aparello de cromatografia liquida de alta efciencia (CLAE) foi um Varian Pro Star, com detectores UV-Vis. As columas analiticas e preparativas utilizadas foram Phenomenex tipo Luna - C18 (250 x 4.60 mm, 5 mm) e (250 x 21,20 mm, 10 mm), respectivamente.\n\nOs meios de cultura liquido e solido foram submetiods a esteriliaz zacao em autoclave a 121 degC e 1 atm de pressao por 20 min.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nFolhas saudaveis de _Piper aduncum_ foram coletadas na Casa Vegetacao do Instituto de Quimica - UNESP- Araraquara em maio de 2001.\n\n## Isolamento dos fungos endofticos\n\nAs folhas coletadas foram lavadas com agua e sabao, a seguir esteriliazas por imersao em NaClO (1%) por 5 min, seguido de etanol 70% por 1 min e lavadas com agua esteriliazada 2 vezes por 10 min, 1/32/ As folhas esteriliazadas foram assepicamente seccionadas em segmentos de 1 cm2 aproximadamente e colocados em placa de Petri, contendo o meio de cultura bata dextrose agar (PDA), marca Difco, preparado na concentracao de 39 g/L, acrescido do antibiotico sulfato de gentamicina e incubado a 25 degC. O crescimento dos fungos f orio monitorado diariamente e, apos cada cultura atingir de 1-2 cm em diametro, foram submetiods a successivas repicacas e detbencao das linagens puras. Forma obtidas ese linagenes puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Quimica Organica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como _Xylaria_ sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Colecao Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292.\n\n## Cultivo em meio liquido e obtencao dos extratos brutos\n\nO fungo endofittico _Xylaria_ sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 das. A seguir foi inculado em 20 fixesos de Erlenmeyer s (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentracao de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantios em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 degC por 28 das. Apos este periodo o caldo foi separado do micelio por filtarxio, extradao com ACoEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extrado com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fracao CHCl, (0,7 g).\n\n## Isolamento das citocalasins\n\nA fracao CHCl, (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de silica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco fracoes: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1). Estas foram analisadas por CLAE-DAD (Si C-18, gradiente H2O:CH,CN 5 a 100% de CH,CN, 40 min, fluxo de 1 mL/min), sendo detectada una alta concentracao de citocalasana no faxica pA-01-3.\n\nA fracao PA-01-3 foi submetada a CLAE-prep em fase reversa [A = 220 nm, 10 mL/min CH3CN:H2O (68:32)], resultando nas cito-calasinas **1** (5,5 mg, t8 = 71 min), **2** (17,5 mg, t8 = 32 min), **3** (30,0 mg, tk = 54 min), **4** (15,0 mg, tk = 26 min), **5\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n**Determinacao da viabilidade celular**\n\nPara a determinacao da ciotoxicidade das citocalasinas **1-6**, foram utilizadas as linhagens de celulas de mmiferos HeLa (tumor de cervix humano) e CHO (ovario de hamster chinos) na densidade de 2 x 10\\({}^{4}\\) celulas pocos\".

Leite,1 Artur Placrees Neto,1 Alessandra R. P. Ambrozin,1 Joao B. Fernandes,1 Paulo C. Vieira,1 Maria F. das G. F. da Silva,1 Sergio de Albuquerque2\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe activity of crude extracts of three _Rapanca_ species (Myrsinaceae) and _Cipadessa fruticosa_ (Meliaceae) was evaluated _in vitro_ against the trypanostigote forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Thirty-three extracts from different organs of these species were assayed and eleven of them showed significant activity (lysis % >50). The fractionation of an active extract from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (99.5%) led to the isolation of two flavonoids: quercetin and taxifolain, which have weak trypanoacid activity. Additionally, one active extract from fruits of _C. fruticosa_ (97.7%) afforded mexicanotide limonoids: cipadesi, mexicanolide, febfirtigugin and cipadesi \\(A\\), that were slightly active on _T. cruzi_. Moreover, other two flavonoids (flavone and 7-methoxyflavone), previously assayed against _T. cruzi_, were isolated from the hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (100%). The results presented here suggest that the plants evaluated could be a source of new active compounds against _T. cruzi_.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nChagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis) affects 16-18 million people, mostly from Central and South America, where 25% of the total population is at risk of infection (WHO, 2004). It is caused by a flagellate protozoan, _Trypanosoma cruzi_, and transmitted to humans by blood-sucking trationine insects and by blood transfusion (WHO, 1997). With the control of the insect vector (_Triatoma infestans_), infected blood transfusion is becoming the major cause for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). The only trypanoicidal substance currently used to prevent the infection by this route is gentian violet, but its use is limited due to undesirable effects on the patients (Dias, 1993). The treatment of Chagas' disease is still a challenge, since the only current available drug (benzimidazole) has strong side effects (de Castro, 1993). Thus, the search for more efficient and less toxic drugs is needed to control this disease.\n\nIn the past years, the study of compounds isolated from plants has received considerable attention in the search for alternative chemotherapy of parasitic diseases (Serrano et al., 2000) and many natural compounds have been identified as trypanocides (Duschak & Couto, 2007;\n\n## Page 2\n\nGuimaraes & Faria, 2007). Several extracts from plants of Meliaceae and Rutaceae families have been showed _in vitro_ activity against _T. cruzi_ (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004; de Mesquita et al., 2005). Therefore, natural products constitute a promising source of new active compounds for treatment of Chagas' disease.\n\nIn this paper, we report the results of the evaluation of _in vitro_ trypanocidal activity of 33 crude extracts from different organs of _Rapanea lancifolia, R. guianensis, R. umbelata_ Myrsinaaceae, and _Cipadessa fruitcosa_ Meliaceae. Moreover, it is showed the trypanocidal activity of flavonoids isolated from hexane extracts from branches of _R. lancifolia_ and _C. fruitcosa_, as well the activity of four limonoids isolated from dichloromethane extract from fruits of _C. fruitcosa_.\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n### Plant material\n\nPlants were collected in different states of Brazil and identified by Dr. Maria Ines Salgueiro Lima from Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP and Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani from Department of Botany, USP, SP (Table 1).\n\n### Extraction and isolation of compounds\n\nThe powdered air-dried plant material was extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed against _T. cruzi_.\n\nThe hexane extract (9.3 g) from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (fresh weight: 1870 g) was fractionated through column chromatography on silica gel affording hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol fractions. The methanol fraction (1.5 g) was chromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, giving four fractions. Fraction 4 was fractionated in the same conditions to yield compounds **1** (3.2 mg) and **2** (3.7 mg).\n\nThe hexane extract (12.2 g) from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (fresh weight: 1524 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give nine fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1), affording nine fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 7 (16.7 mg) and **8** (8.2 mg).\n\nThe dichloromethane extract from fruits (15.0 g) of _C. fruticosa_ (fresh weight: 180 g), was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, resulting in the fractions: hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:1); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1); EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Fractions CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1) and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) were studied, as following described: the fraction CH2Cl/AcOEt (1:1) (5.0 g) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography on silica gel using a gradient elution (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH), resulting in the four corresponding soluble fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (2.3 g) obtained from the last fractionation was several times chromatographed on silica gel and finally submitted to preparative HPLC to afford for limonoids **3** (19.4 mg), **5** (8.1 mg), and **6** (8.5 mg). Limonoid **4** (48.9 mg) was isolated from fraction EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) (4.6 g) of extract through several chromatographies on silica gel.\n\nCompounds **1**-**6 were identified through 'H and '1C NMR spectra, 'H - 'H COSY, HSQC and HMBC experiments and MS. The spectral data of **1** and **2** were in agreement with those published in the literature (Kuo et al., 1998; Moon et al., 2001) as well as the data of limonoids **3** (Luo et al., 2000), **4** (Paula, 1996), **5** (Govindachari & Kumari, 1998) and **6** (Leite et al. 2005a). Additionally, compounds **7** and **8** were characterized by comparison of '1C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975). The _in vitro_ activity on _T. cruzi_ of compounds **3** - **6** is described herein. On the other hand, the activities of compounds **1, 2, 7** and **8** were previously reported (Ambrozin et al., 2004; Tasdemir et al., 2006).\n\n### Bioassay\n\nThe bioassays were carried out according to the procedures described by Ambrozin et al. (2008). The activity of crude extracts was evaluated in triplicate at 4 mg/mL and pure substances at 250, 100, and 50 mg/mL. It is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (mmol/L) for compounds **3-6** were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline Plant & Herbarium/collected in & Voucher number \\\\ \\hline _Rapanea lancifolia_ & HUFSCar - Department & 6700 \\\\ (Mart.)

Eleven of them (33%) showed significant activity (lysis %0 > 50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypanastigote forms of _T. cruzi._ The majority of the extracts of _C. fruticosa_ presented relevant activity. The best result was obtained from the hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFBH) that reduced 100% of the parasite number. The majority of the extracts of the three _Rapanea_ species assayed did not present significant results, since several extracts led to the total lysis of the parasites and the red blood cells, as well. However, some extracts of these species showed high trypanocidal activity without affecting the red blood cells, such as the hexane extract from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (RLBH).\n\nSimilar studies involving the trypanocidal activity of Meliaceae and Rutaceae species have been reported by our group (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2008) showing that these plants can be considered a promising source of active compounds against trypanastigote forms of _T. cruzi._ Thus, the significant results obtained from the extracts of _C. fruticosa_ are consistent with those previously reported for this family.\n\nThe investigation of the methanol fraction of the active hexane extract from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (RLBH) led to the isolation of the flavonol quercetin **(1)**\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Plant & Plant part & Solvent extraction & Crude extract & Lysis \\% \\\\  & & hexane & RLFLH & 76.8 \\\\  & flowers & dichloromethane & RLFLD & 72.2 \\\\  & & methanol & RLFLM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RLLH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\ _Rapanea lancifolia_ (Myrsinaceae) & leaves & dichloromethane & RLLD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RLLM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RLBH & 99.5 \\\\  & branches & dichloromethane & RLBD & 7.0 \\\\  & & methanol & RLBM & 47.69 \\\\  & & hexane & RGFLH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & flowers & dichloromethane & RGFLD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RGFLM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RGLH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & leaves & dichloromethane & RGD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\ _Rapanea guianensis_ (Myrsinaceae) & & methanol & RGLM & 68.5 \\\\  & branches & hexane & RGBH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & branches & dichloromethane & RGBD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RGBM & 6.94 \\\\  & & Hexane & RUFRH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & fruits & dichloromethane & RUFRD & 69.4 \\\\  & & methanol & RUFRM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RURH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\ _Rapanea umbrellaa_ (Myrsinaceae) & roots & dichloromethane & RURD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RURM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & CFFRH & 95.5 \\\\  & fruits & dichloromethane & CFFRD & 97.7 \\\\  & & methanol & CFFRM & 60.6 \\\\  & & Hexane & CFLH & 33.7 \\\\  & leaves & dichloromethane & CFLD & 92.8 \\\\ _Cipadesaa fruiticosa_ (Meliaceae) & & methanol & CFLM & 40.2 \\\\  & branches & bicarbonate & CFBH & 100 \\\\  & & methanol & CFBD & 76.1 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: _In vitro_ activity of the crude extracts (4 mg/mL) of _Rapanea_ species and _Cipadesaa fruiticosa_ on trypanastigote forms of _Typanosoma cruzi._\n\n## Page 4\n\nand the dihydroflavonol taxifolin (**2**). Several biological activities have been reported for these flavonoids. Quercetin (**1**), for example, presented antiprotozoan effect against _Plasmodium falciparum_ (IC\\({}_{50}=14\\) uM), _Trypanosoma brucei_ (IC\\({}_{50}=13.2\\) uM), _Leishmania donovani_ (IC\\({}_{50}=63.8\\) uM) (Camacho et al., 2002), _T. brucei_ and _T. rhodesiense_ (Williamson & Finnigan, 1978). In addition, this compound was described as a constituent of an aqueous extract from _Lychnophora pinaster,_ Asteraceae which showed trypanocidal activity (Silveira et al., 2005). Recently, high leishmanicidal activity was described for such compound (Tasdemir et al., 2006). Compounds **1** and **2** were previously assayed on trypantigote forms of _T. cruzi,_ but showed low activity (Tasdemir et al., 2006). The relevant activity of the original extract (RLBH) is probably associated with the presence of other compounds or mixture of them.\n\nThe mexicanolide limonoids **3-6**, isolated from fruits of _C. fruticosa_, showed significant trypanocidal activity (Table 3). They were obtained from the very active dichloromethane extract of fruits (Table 2, CFFRD, 97.7 %). This extract also afforded other limonoids (Leite et al., 2005a,b), which were not assayed herein. Recently, we reported the inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from _T. cruzi._ The results showed that crude extracts from _C. fruticosa_ showed high ability to inhibit the enzyme activity (Leite et al., 2009). Thus, this specie could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against Chagas' disease. In addition, the extracts from _C. fruticosa_ showed high inhibition of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), a key enzyme from _Leishmania_ that has been proposed as a target for the rational search of new leishmanicidal drugs (Ambrozin et al., 2005b).\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nThe trypanaccial activity of flavone (**7**) and 7-methoxyflavone (**8**), isolated from the active hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFBH), was previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active fraction of _Conchocarpus heterophyllus_ (Rutaceae), presented low activity against trypanastigote forms of _T. cruzi_ (\\(\\text{IC}_{50}=2116\\) and 787 mg/mL or 9531 and 1084 mmol/L, respectively) when compared with other flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004). Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites of C. _frutticosa._ As limonoids in the present work showed trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH extract may be associated with these compounds.\n\nThe trypanaccial activity of flavone (**7**) and 7-methoxyflavone (**8**), isolated from the active hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFBH), was previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active fraction of _Conchocarpus heterophyllus_ (Rutaceae), presented low activity against trypanastigote forms of _T. cruzi_ (\\(\\text{IC}_{50}=2116\\) and 787 mg/mL or 9531 and 1084 mmol/L, respectively) when compared with other flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004). Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites of C. _frutticosa._ As limonoids in the present work showed trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH extract may be associated with these compounds.\n\n## References\n\n* (1)\n* (2) Ambrozin ARP, Leite AC, Silva M, Vieira PC, Fernandes JB, Thiemann OH, da Silva MFGF, Oliva G 2005b.

As fracoes form monitoradas via RMN 'H e ESI-EM/EM e foram analisadas somente aquelas eujos espectros apresentavam caracteristicas de alcaloides do acido antranfilico e flavonoides nao isolados anteriormente. Foram isolados do caule os alcaloides flindersina, skimminaina, 8-metoxifillersina e dictamnina; das folhas os flavonoides 3',4',7,8-tetrametoxi-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimtiplirano)-flavona, 3',4',5,7,8-pentametoxiflavona, 5-hidroxi-3',4',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona, 3',4'-metilendiodioxi-5,6,7-trimetoxiflavona e-3',4'-metilendiodioxi-6,7-dimetoxiflavona., Os alcaloides do acido antranfilico nao foram encentrodas em deza.\n\nVarios flavonoides isolados de N. paracensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, enxerto de _Citrus sinensis_ (Rutaceae) e _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) forum testados frente a gliceraldehyde-3-fosfato desidrogenase de _Trypamosoma cruzi_, visando verificar seus potenciais em inibir a attividade da enzima. Os flavonoides polimetoxidados e um isoflavononide foram os mais attivos.\n\nOur taxonomic interest in the _Neoraputia_ stimulated an investigation of _N. paraensis_ searching for alkaloids. Fractions were monitored by 'H NMR and ESI-MS/MS and only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. Stems afforded the alkaloids finderine, skimminaine, 8-metohydroylindersine and dictamine; leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethylo-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone, 3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethyloflavone, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years.\n\nA number of flavonoids isolated from _N. paraensis_, _N. magnifica_, _Murraya paniculata_, _Citrus sinensis_ graft (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Highly oxygenated flavones and isoflavone were the most actives.\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Neoraputia_ species were originally described by Engler as species of _Raputia_ Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus _Neoraputia_ Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them from _Raputia_ and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae.1 Previous investigations of _Neoraputia_ reported the presence of eleven polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavones, one 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone and one flavanone from _N. alba_ (Engler) Emmerich;23 five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6-pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-polymethoxylated chalcones from _N.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nmagnifica_ var. _magnifica_ (Engler) Emmerich;4,5 ten polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavones and one 6-(3\"-hydroxy.3\"-methyl-\\(trans\\)-but-1\"-enyl)-flavone from _N. paraensis_.6,7 All phytochemical studies on _Neoraputia_ genus have been undertaken in our laboratory and by Arruda _et al_.6,7, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. If Emmerich'proposal is correct, that _Neoraputia_ is a Cusparieae member, then this genus can be regarded as a potential source of anthranilate alkaloids. Thus, it would be not surprising if anthranilate alkaloids had remained undiscovered in the _Neoraputia_ because of their low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove _Neoraputia_ to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated flavones.4,8 Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of _Neoraputia_ species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. In order to establish this we have now undertaken a further investigation of _N. paraensis_.\n\nChagas' disease, caused by the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organisation). Control of the insect vector (_Triatoma infestans_) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side effects.9 The bloodstream form of the parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_ has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production.9 This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined.9 Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with significant differences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested.9\n\nHighly oxygenated flavones from _Neoraputia_\\(magnifica\\) have shown to be the most actives as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor.5 These data stimulated an investigation of other flavonoids. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, flavonoids isolated from _Neoraputia_\\(paraensis\\), _N. magnifica_, _Murraya paniculata_, _Citrus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from _Trypanosoma cruzi_.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nOur taxonomic interest in the _Neoraputia_ stimulated an investigation of the extracts from stems and leaves of _N. paraensis_ searching for alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff's reagent on TLC plates. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations.\n\nThe dichloromethane extract from stems afforded only the alkaloid flindserine (**1**).10 The HSQC and HMBC experiments on flindserine, permitted minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments.10 Table 1 shows that the signals for C-3 and C-10 to C-12 were reassigned. The observed correlations between the methine hydrogen signal at d 6.77 and the 13C signals at d 162.5, 157.3 and 79.1 led to their assignments as C-2, C-4, C-13, respectively. The upfield methine hydrogen signal at d 5.56 showed correlation with the 13C signals at d 105.8, 79.1 and 26.3 permitting the assignment of these signals to C-3, C-13 and C-14/15, respectively. The signals at d 6.77 and 5.56 were then assigned to H-11 and H-12, respectively.\n\nThe methanolic extract from stems afforded skimminanine,11 8-methoxyfildersine (**2**)12 and dictamine.13,14 As no carbon shifts of **2** could be found in the literature, these data are listed in Table 1. Complete and unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for **2** were made using the HSQC and HMBC techniques and using **1** and haplophytin A (**3**)15 as a models. The methine hydrogen signal at d 6.71 showed correlation with the 13C signals at d 157.1 permitting the assignment of these signals to H-11 and C-4. Thus, in compound **1** and **2**, H-11 is more deshielded than H-12. However, in model **3** the presence of the methoxyl at C-5 caused downfield shift of the usual range for 4,O-3-chromene quinolines, resulting in the H-12 being more deshielded than H-11. The methoxyl at C-5 also induces effects on C-10 and C-3, exhibiting upfield displacement for C-10 and downfield displacement for C-3. These data were also confirmed by HMBC experiments.15\n\nThe _n_-hexane extract of the leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethyl-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone3 (**4**) which has not been recorded from _N. paraensis_. The dichloromethane extract from leaves gave four flavonoids,\n\n## Page 3\n\n3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone16 (**5**), 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethyl flavone17 (**6**), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone5 (**7**) and **8**, which are reported for the first time from _N. paraensis_, while the latter appears to be new.\n\nThe flavone **8** exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 'H NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3',4'-substitution (\\(\\delta\\) 7.33, d, \\(J\\) 1.8 Hz, H-2'; \\(\\delta\\) 6.93, d, \\(J\\) 8.2 Hz, H-5'; \\(\\delta\\) 7.46, dd, \\(J\\) 8.2 and 1.8 Hz, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for two methoxy groups (\\(\\delta\\) 3.97, s; 3.92, s), one methylenedioxy group (\\(\\delta\\) 6.08, s, 2H), one hydroxyl group at \\(\\delta\\) 12.73 (1H, s, OH-5) and two singlets at \\(\\delta\\) 6.54 (H-8) and 6.55 (H-3) indicating the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted and a flavone nucleus. The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)17 fragments in ESI-MS/MS of this flavone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B-rings. Thus, a combination of 'H NMR data and the fragment ions at _m/z_ 146 (30%) and 181 (RDA-Me, 100%) fully supported the presence of 3',4'-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy or 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-OH-7,8- and 5-OH-6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-OH-3,7,8- and 5-OH-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavonol indicated that C-6 methine (_ca._\\(\\delta\\) 96) resonates at lowerfield than C-8 methine (_ca._\\(\\delta\\) 91).18 Thus,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} Atom & \\(\\mathbf{8^{\\rm a}}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{9^{\\rm a}}\\).18 & \\(\\mathbf{10^{\\rm b}}\\).5 \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) (_J_) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\n\n## Page 4\n\nthe correct A-ring was decided on the basis of 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which showed signal at d 90.6 for C-8, so placing the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-6. From these data **8** was characterised as 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone (**9**)18 and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone (**10**).5\n\nPreliminary work was firstly undertaken on specimens collected in Paragominas, state of Para, north of Brazil, in February 1991.6,7 The present results obtained from specimens originating from Uruyuca, Bahia (February 1993), showed that there was no difference in the flavonoids between the two collections. However, alkaloids were obtained only from plants of northeast region (Bahia), which is characterized by drought summer, compared to rainy summer in the northern (Para). In contrast, _Neoraputia alba_ and _N. magnifica_ collected in Espirito Santo, near northeast of Brazil, had only high concentration of flavonoids. Thus, geographic-variation do not seem to be an important environmental factor. The low concentration of anthranilate alkaloids is likely to be responsible for the alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. All alkaloids were obtained in very small amounts (1-3 mg), only flindersine (**1**) was present in substantial amounts (10 mg).\n\nIn a previous paper concerning the chemical systematics of Cusparieae, which _Neoraputia_ has been assigned,8 the importance of coumarins and anthranilate alkaloids was highlighted. This study brings into focus polyoxygenated flavonoids as another taxonomically useful chemical marker in this group. Many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds presents in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far.\n\nA number of flavonoids isolated from _Neoraputia paraensis_, _N. magnifica_,45_Murraya paniculata_,19_Cirus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon20_ (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus21 (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from _Trypanosoma cruzi_. The positive results are summarized at Table 3 and the occurrence of flavonoids evaluated at Table 4. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 65% when 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethyl-5',6'-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (**11**) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 _m_g mL-1, suggesting that chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The flavones 3',4',5',5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (**12**), 3',4',5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone (**13**), 4',5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (**14**) and flavonoid 3',4',5',3,5,6,7-heptamethoxyflavonol (**15**) completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 99-100%) at 100 _m_g mL-1. The activity does not appear to be affected by the introduction of the 3-OMe substituent into the flavone\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound & Concentration (_μ_g mL−1) & Absorbance & Specific activity (U mg−1) & \\% Inhibitory activity \\\\\n**4** & 35 & 0.249 & 14.69 & 68 \\\\ Control & 35 & 0.773 & 45.61 & \\\\\n**5** & 50 & 0.312 & 22.38 & 45 \\\\ Control & 50 & 0.568 & 40.62 & \\\\\n**7** & 50 & 0.606 & 43.28 & 0 \\\\  & 100 & 0.395 & 28.18 & 36 \\\\ Control & 50 & 0.594 & 42.42 & \\\\  & 100 &\n\n## Page 5\n\nskeleton. However, the activity of 3',4',5',3,5,7,8-heptamethoxyflavonol (**16**) was comparable to that of **15** but, reducing the enzymatic activity by 88% at 100 _m_g mL-1. This finding shows that the activity varies with the position of methoxyl group. The higher activity of **12**, **13**, **14** and **15** could possibly be attributed to a greater symmetry of electron density of the molecules. Flavones 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone (**10**) and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (**7**) do not display significant GAPDH activity (26% and 36%, respectively) showing that 3',4'-methylenedioxy reduce drastically inhibitory activity. Differences between polyoxygenated flavones and isoflavone afromosine (**17**) inhibitory activities are not significant, indicating that the presence of many methoxy groups in isoflavones are not a requirement for activity. However, isoflavone possess 3-phenylchromone skeleton and it may be incorrect to compare it with the other flavones tested. GAPDH activity was also inhibited by 96% when auroralordirobtusone A (**18**) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 _m_g mL-1.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Compound & Family/Species & References \\\\\n**4** & Rutaceae \\\\\n**4** & _Neoraputia alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. parensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**5** & _N. alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**7** & _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**10** & _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\\n**11** & _N. magnifica_ & 4, 5 \\\\\n**12** & _N. alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 6, 7 \\\\\n**13** & _Citrus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ & 20 \\\\\n**14** & _C. sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ & 20 \\\\\n**15** & _Murraya paniculata_ & 19 \\\\\n**16** & _M. paniculata_ & 19 \\\\  & Leguminosae \\\\\n**17** & _Lonchocarpus montanus_ & 21 \\\\\n**18** & _L. montanus_ & 21 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Occurrence of flavonoids evaluated on TcGAPDH activity \n\n## Page 6\n\nThus, clearly isoflavonoids and auronoids deserve more attention as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitors. Highly oxygenated flavones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal GAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavonoids and the enzyme GAPDH.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General\n\nNMR on a Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard.

Only the concentrated extracts containing alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragondorff's reagent on thin-layer chromatography plates, were worked. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations.\n\nThe concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from stem was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel. Elution with a _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1:0.2) afforded 16 fractions. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording **1** (10 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The concentrated CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography over silanized silica elution with MeOH-H2O (1:1) afforded 10 fractions. Fraction 8 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient affording 2 fractions. Fraction 1 was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (5:0.4:0.4) and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (4.6:0.4) affording skimmianine (3 mg). Fraction 2 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 A pore diameter; eluant: CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1); flow rate: 4.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, 254 nm) to give **2** (second peak, 1.2 mg) and dictamnine (first peak, 1.0 mg), after four cycles of 80 min.\n\nThe concentrated _n_-hexane extract of the leaves was four times flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient, _n_-hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, _n_-hexane-EtOAc gradient, and finally with silica gel and Florisil (1:1) eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording **4** (20 mg).\n\nThe concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shocke Asahipack GS-310P; eluant: MeOH; flow rate: 5.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, \\(l\\) 240 nm) to give **8** (second peak, 2.7 mg), after three cycles of 60 min. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 also were purified by R-HPLC (as above; flow rate: 6.0 mL min-1) to give **5** (second peak, 5.0 mg), **6** (second peak, 4.0 mg) and **7** (second peak, 3.0 mg) after three cycles of 60 min, respectively.\n\nHydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyeflavone (**8**).

The reaction medium was 50 mmol L-1 Tris-HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 _b_-mercaptoethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD*, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 4-9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 _m_L. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme.\n\nThe specific activity (unit = U) of the enzyme was calculated as:\n\n\\[(\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}) = \\{(\\Delta\\text{ absorbance}/\\Delta\\text{ t})\\text{ x volume of cell}\\}/6.22\\text{ x volume of enzyme x [ enzyme] where \\(\\Delta\\text{ t}\\) = 0.5 min; volume of cell = 1.00 mL; 'NADH = 6.22 (mmol L-1)-1 cm-1; volume of enzyme = 0.005 mL; [enzyme] concentration of enzyme in mg mL-1.\n\n### _T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity_\n\nThe inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 _m_L. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30s interval. Flavonoids were tested at 50 and 100 _m_g mL-1 in 10% DMSO using 5 _m_L of GAPDH at 0.90 mg mL-1.\n\nIn each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO in the reaction medium and was used as the positive control. The specific activity of TcGAPDH was not significantly affected by the presence of 10% DMSO.\n\nData were means of 3 repetitions and values as percent of control were used as follows:\n\n\\[\\%\\text{ inhibitory activity} = \\{(\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ control} - \\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ compound})/\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ control}\\}\\text{ x 100}\\]\n\nEnzymatic inhibition studies have been carried out in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.\n\nSome of the potentially active substances, as flavones **6** and **8**, can not be assayed with the standard procedure described here, due to problems of solubility in the reaction buffer and absorption of light close to the wavelength used to observe the reaction course (340 nm). To overcome these limitations an alternative technique is being developed, based on calorimetric measurements, similar to procedures adopted with other enzymes.24\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES).

DIC leaf extracts of _T. pallida_ yielded six compounds, the triterpenes 24-methylenecycloarta-3b-ol (TRIT-1), 24-methylenecycloarta-3b-26-diol (TRIT-2) and cycloarta-23-eno-3b,25-diol (TRIT-3), the sterols 24-methylene-3,22-dihydroxycholesterol (EST-1), 24-methylenecholesterol (EST-2) and 24-methylene-3b,4b,22-trihydroxycholesterol (EST-3), while the fruit extract yielded the limonoid gedunine (LIM). These molecules were dissolved in acetone and sprayed at 0.1% on tomato leaflets infested with newly-hatched larvae. Larval mortality at day 5 and 9 after infestation, larval and pupal developmental time and survival, pupal weight and adult malformation were evaluated. TRIT-1, EST-1 and LIM were the most effective against _T. absoluta_ due to larval development arrestment and reduced larval survivorship.\n\nRESUMO - A partir do extrato em dichloromethane (DIC) de folhas e futos de _Trichilia pallida_ Swartz, objetivou-se fazer o isolamento e identificacao de substancias com attividade insecticide sobre a traca-do-tomateiro, _Tuta absoluta_ (Meyrick). Do extrato em DIC de folhas de _T. pallida_ foram isolados os triterpenes 24-metilenoicol aorta-3b-ol (TRIT-1), 24-metilenoicolourta-3b-26-diol (TRIT-2) e cicolaorta-23-eno-3b,25-diol (TRIT-3), os esteroides 24-metileno-3,22-didroxicolesterol (EST-1), 24-metilenoicolosterol (EST-2) e 24-metileno-3b,4b,22-trihydroxycholesterol (EST-3), alem do limonoide gedunina (LIM) obtido de frutos da planta. As substancias foram dissolvidas em acetona e pulverizadas a 0,1% em foliolos de tomateiro infestados com lagartas recem-eclodidas. Foram avaliadas a mortalidade de lagartas aos quinto e nono dina apos a infestacao, duracao e sobrevivencia das fases de larva e pupa, peso de pupas e porcentagem de adultos deformados. TRIT-1, EST-1 e LIM foram as moleculas que apresentaram maior attividade sobre _T. absoluta_, alongando o desenvolvimento larval e reduzindo a sobrevivencia dessa fase.\n\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE: _Lycoopersicon esculentum_, inseticida botanico, produto natural, controle, traca-do-tomateiro\n\nA cultura do tomateiro, _Lycoopersicon esculentum_ (Mill.), e atacada por varias especies de insectos-praga, sendo a traca _Tuta absoluta_ (Meyrick) considerada uma das mais prejudiciais. Ela pode ocorrer durante todo ciclo de desenvolvimento da cultura, independentemente do periodo em que tomate seja cultivado (Franca & Castelo Branco 1992). Suas larvas minadoras alimentam-se inicialmente do mesofilo foliar, construindo galerias transparentes, podendo tambem broquear o cuale, perfurar o broto terminal, danificar flores e frutos. Estes, alen de teram a polpa destruida, ficam mais susctiveis a penetracao de microorganismos, tornado-se, na maiora das vezes, inviaveis a comercializacao (Castelo Branco 1992, Souza & Reis 1992).\n\nO controle de _T. absoluta_ e principalmente quimico, caracterizado por aplicacoes successivas de inseticidas, chegando, em alguns casos, a 36 pulverizacoes por cultivo\n\n## Page 2\n\n(Picanco _et al_. 1995). Apesar disso, de modo geral, nao se tem obtido a eficacia desejada devido a selecao de populacoes resistentes aos principios ativos empregados (Siqueira _et al_. 2000, Lietti _et al_. 2005) e a eliminacao de populacoes de inimigos naturais da traca (Miranda _et al_. 2005). Somados a seses problemas, estao oes referentes a intoxicacoes de protolutores e de consumidores pelos residuos dos agrotoxicos utilizados, contaminacao do ambiente e alto custo de producao (Franca & Castelo Branco 1992, Souza & Reis 1992, Guedes _et al_. 1994, Picanco _et al_. 1995). Assim, e primordial a disponibilizacao e adocao de medidas que contribuam de maneira a tornar eficaz, viavel economica e ambientalmente, para o controle da traca _T. absoluta_.\n\nUma das alternativas do manoje integrado da traca-do otometareiro e o uso de especies de plantas da familia Meliaceae, fonte de substancias com attividade insecticida. Inumeras pesquisas foram desenvolvidas com o intuito de identificar possiveis efeitos insecticides dessas plantas, principalmente _Azadirachta indica_ A. Juss, comumente denominada nim, que apresenta, entre outros compostos, o limonoide azadiractina. Alem dessa planta, outras, do genero _Trichilia_, que contem aproximadamente 230 especies, distribuidas principalmente na America Tropical, even sendo apontadas com promissors por posuirem subatancias com atividade insecticidea comparael a da azadiractina (Mikolajczak & Reed 1987, Xie _et al_. 1994, Ramirez _et al_. 2000, Wheeler _et al_. 2001).\n\nNo Brasil, em trabalhos visando selecionar especies de meliaceas com attividade sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho, _Spodoptera frugiperda_ (J. E. Smith), destacou-se _Trichilia pallida_ Swartz, (Rodriguez & Vendramim 1996, 1997, Roel & Vendramim 1999, Roel _et al_. 2000a, ba, Bogorini & Vendramim 2005). Aliado a bioatividade encontrada esta o fato de essa especie vegetal, alem de ser nativa do Brasil, estar amplamente distribuida geograficamente (Klein 1984), permitindo prever que tais plantas, partes destas, ou ate mesmo substancias isoladas das mesmas, tem potencial para emprego no controle de pragas.\n\nDiversas pesquisas ja foram conduzidas para avaliar o efeito de extratos de Meliaceae sobre a traca-do-tometareiro _T. absoluta_ (Thomazini _et al_. 2000, Trindade _et al_. 2000, Brunherotto & Vendramim 2001, Vendramim & Thomazini 2001, Goncalves-Gervasio & Vendramim 2007) sem, no entanto, terem como objetivo isolar e avaliar atividade insecticidea de substancias de tais plantas. Em pesquisas recentes, Cunha _et al_. (2005, 2006) identificaram a partir de extratos de folihas de _T. pallida e Trichilia pallens_ C. DC., respectivamente, fracoes com maior potencial inseticida sobre _T. absoluta_. Nesse sentido, objetivo-se neste trabalho avaliar a bioatividade de substancias isoladas de _T. pallida_, a partir do que foi desenvolvido por Cunha _et al_. (2005), sobre _T. absoluta_.\n\n## Material e Metodos\n\nO processo de isolamento de moleculas bioativas de _T. pallida_ e as caracteristicas das moleculas isoladas, sao apresentados por Rocha (2004). Os bioensaios foram realizados a 25 +- 2degC, UR de 60 +- 10% e fotofase de 14h. A criacao de _T. absoluta_ foi feita de acordo com metodo adaptado de Pratissoli (1995) em foliolos de tomateiro cv. Santa Clara cultivado em estufa.\n\nAs varias etapas, que culminaram com a selecao do extrato em diclormetano de folhas de _T. pallida_ como o de major potencial de apresentar substancias com attividade sobre _T. absoluta_, foram detalhadamente descritas por Cunha _et al_. (2005), diferrindo no que se refere ao extrato de frutos em diclormetano.\n\nEfeito de substancias de _T. pallida_ sobre _T. absoluta_. Os bioensaios foram conduzidos seguindo delineamento inteiramente casualizado com ses repeticoes e nove tratamentos, testando ser esta subatancias a 0,1% [24-metilenoicolaorata-3b-ol (TRIT-1); 24-metilenoicolarta-23-eno-3b,25-diol (TRIT-3); 24-metileno-32,2-didroxicolesterol (EST-1); 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2); 24-metileno-3b,4b,22-tridroxicolesterol (EST-3) e gedunina (LIM)], acrescidas dos controles acetona e agua. Dada a importancia de se avaliar o efeito do limonoide gedunina sobre _T. absoluta_, embora o mesmo tenha sido obtido sem bio-monitoramento do extrato em diclormetano de frutos, foi incluido nos bioensaios juntamente com as demais substancias isoladas a partir do extrato em diclormetano de folhas. Incluiu-se a acetona como controle em virtude de ter sido este o solvente utilizado para as referidas moleculas.\n\nAs substancias foram aplicadas em folios de tomateiro por meio de um miniatomizador de acordo com Cunha _et al_. (2005, 2006). A fim de manter a turgescencia dos foliolos, seus pecios foram envolvidos com algodao hidrofilo, umedecido diariamente. Em cada foliolo, sendo tras por repeticao, foram liberadas seis lagarta recem-ecolidolas, totalizando 108 individuos por tratamento. Depois de infestados, os foliolos foram transferidos para placas plasticas (6 cm de diametro) onde permanenteceram ate nove dias apos a infestacao (DAI). Decorrido esse periodo, as lagartas remanescentes foram transferidas para foliolos de tomateiro nao-tratados, preparados conforme descrito anteriormente, sendo avaliada diariamente a mortalidade de lagartas ate a formacao de pupas. As pupas earn entao retiradas dos foliolos e transferidas, individualmente, para tubos de vidro (2,5 cm de diametro e 8,5 cm de altura) para a determinacao do sexo apos 24h.\n\nForam avaliados os seguintes parametros: mortalidade de lagartas (%) ao quinto e nono DAI, duracao (dias) es sobrevivencia (%) da fase larval, peso de pupas (mg), duracao (dias) e sobrevivencia (%) da fase de pupa e adultos deformados (%).\n\n### Analise Estatistica.\n\nOs dados foram submetidos a analise de variancia (ANOVA), sendo as medias comparadas pelo teste de Duncan (P <= 0,05). Quando necessario, os dados foram transformados com base em teste (Hartley) para avaliacao da homocedasticidade de variancias.\n\n### Resultados e Discussao\n\n**Moleculas isoladas de _T. pallida_.** A partir do extrato em diclormetano de folhas de _T. pallida_ foram isoladas seis\n\n## Page 3\n\nmoleculas, sendo tres triterpenoides (TRIT) e tres esteroides (EST) (Fig. 1). A outra molecula, identificada como sendo ilmonoide (LIM) gedunina, foi obtida do extrato em diclorometano de frutos (Fig. 1).\n\n**Efeito das moleculas isoladas sobre _T. absoluta_.** As mortalidades de lagartas de _T. absoluta_ observadas aos 5 DAI para 24-metilenocicolaorta-3b-ol (TRIT-1) e gedunina (LIM) (16,8 e 15,4 % respectivamente) superaram aquelas registradas para 24-metilenocicolaorta-3b-26-diol (TRIT-2), 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2), 24-metileno-3b,4b,22-tridioxicolesterol (EST-3) e cicolaorta-23-eno-3b,25-diol (TRIT-3) (Tabela 1). O esteroide 24-metileno-3,22-didioxicolesterol (EST-1), embora nao tenha ocasionado mortalidade significativa, foi o unico tratamento, aos 5 DAI, que nao diferiu do triterpenoide TRIT-1 e do limonoide LIM.\n\nAos 9 DAI, a semelhanca do observado aos 5 DAI, apenas\n\nFig. 1: Moloéculas isoladas a partir do extrato de _T. pallida_ em diclorometano.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nas substancias LIM (20,9%) e TRIT-1 (19,6%) diferiram dos controles acetona (7,2%) e aigu (3,9%), sendo que EST-1, alem de nao diferir de TRIT-1 e LIM, tampem ocasionou mortalidade de lagartas superior a do controle aigu (Tabela 1). Alem disso, de 5 DAI para 9 DAI, observou-se um incremento na mortalidade de lagartas de 77,4% para EST-1, enquanto que para TRIT-1 e LIM os incrementos foram de 16,7% c 35,7%, respectivamente. Assim, pode-se inferir que o efeito toxico causado as lagarats pelo esteroide EST-1 pode ser cronico, le vando maior tempo para ocasionar a morte do insecto em relacao a TRIT-1 e LIM.\n\nTRIT-1, LIM e EST-1, alem de terem sido responsaveis pelos maiores valores de mortalidade de lagartas de _T. absoluta_ aos 5 DAI e 9 DAI, tampem ocasionaram maior duracao da fase larval (Tabela 2). A duracao dessa fase para os tratamentos com LIM e EST-1 foi de 15,2 e 14,9 dias respectivamente, diferindo dos controles acetona (13,5 dias) e aigu (12,8 dias), sendo que para TRIT-1 (14,3 dias), house diferenca apenas em relacao ao controle com aigu (Tabela 2). Alem disso, LIM e EST-1 ocasionaram sobervienca larval (67,3% e 65,0% respectivamente) inferior aqueles registradas nos controles acetona (85,6%) e aigu (92,5%), sendo que TRIT-1 tampem reduziu a sobrevivencia (74,5%); porem, apenas em relacao ao controle com aigu (Tabela 2).\n\nSegundo Rodriguez & Vendramim (1996), e interessante que haja prolongamento da fase larval, pois, em condicoes de campo, o insecto ficaria por mais tempo propenso ao ataque de inimigos naturais, gerando ainda assincrona entre os adultos dessa populacao em relacao aos individuos da populacao normal.\n\nAssim, o triterpenoide TRIT-1, a limonide LIM e esteroide EST-1, alem de apresentarem efeito toxico sobre lagarats de _T. absoluta_, caracterizado pelos maiores indices de mortalidade (Tabela 1), possivelmente tambem tenham exercido efeito fagodeterrente, que teria, por sua vez, prolongado a fase larval e reduzido a sobrevivencia dessa fase (Tabela 2).\n\nAlem desses efeitos, lagartas alimentadas em foliolos tratados com o triterpenoide TRIT-1 apresentaram alteracoes possivelmente relacionadas ao sistema endocrino, uma vez que algumas lagartas nao conseguiram se livrar completamente da exivia, o que ocasionou o anelamento do abdome do inseto, impedindo-o de se alimentar e de se locomover, coorrendo enta o a morte por occasao da ecdisa (Fig. 2), assim como observado para _S. frugiperda_ (Roel _et al._ 2000b).\n\nOs efeitos causados pelo triterpenoide TRIT-1 em _T. absoluta_ e os citados por Roel _et al._ (2000d) foram igualmente observados em outras especies de insteos e atribuidos ao tetranortriterpenoide (limonoide) azadiractina, principal substancia com attividade insecticide do nim (Martinez & van Emden 2001, Mordue (Luntz) & Blackwell 1993, Mordue (Luntz) & Nisbet 2000). Pode-se, pois, inferir que 24-metienicolcalorata-3b-ol (TRIT-1) tenha atuado de forma semelmente a aazadiractina, reduzindo, provacmente, a concentracao de edisdino an hemolinfa, levando o inseto a morte pela incapacidade de se livrar de exuvia (Fig. 2).\n\nApesar dos efeitos observados em relacao a fase larval, TRIT-1, LIM e EST-1 nao afteram a duracao e sobrevivencia da fase pupal, bem como o peso de pupas femeas e machos em relacao aos controles (acetone a equa) (Tabela 3). Resultados semelhantes form observados por Rodriguez & Vendramim (1996), que, ao avaliarem o efeito de extratos aquos de diferentes estururas vegetas de 11 especies de Meliaceae sobre _S. frugiperda_, constatatarum que os parametros relacionados a fase de larva foram mais afetados que os das fase de pupa. De acordo com Tanzubil & McCafferty (1990),\n\n## Page 5\n\ntais resultados estariam associados a baixa concentracao da molecula attiva, uma vez que houve inbibicao do crescimento de lagartas (Tabela 2). No entanto, estas nao reduziram o consumo de alimento, o que refletiu em pupas com pesos equivalentes aquelas dos controles (Tabela 3).\n\nAcescendo-se a isso, o peso de pupas femeas (Tabela 3) formadas a partir de lagartas alimentadas em foliolog tratados com TRIT-1, foi superior as do controle (agua). Esse resultado, em principio contraditorio, uma vez que a referida sustancia causo as maiores mortalidades de lagartas nos 5 DAI e 9 DAI (Tabela 1), prolonga a fase de larva e reduzir sua sobrevivencia (Tabela 2), pode ser decorrente de uma possivel selecao, de maneira que apenas os individuos mais vigorosos (com maior peso), e portanto mais aptos a a tingir a fase adulta, teriam sobrevivido (Vendramim & Scampini 1997). Outrossim, como se pode observar na Tabela 3, houve maior sobrevivencia da fase de pupa para EST-1 em relacao a EST-2. Esse resultado tambem parece contraditorio, uma vez que o esteroide EST-1 ocasionou maior mortalidade de lagartas aos 9 DAI comparada aos controles (acetone a eagua), prolongou a fase larval e reduzir de maneira significativa a sobrevivencia dessa fase. No entanto, de maneira similar ao observado com o peso de pupas femeas envolvendo TRIT-1 e o controle (agua) (Tabela 3), possivelmente tambem possa ter ocorrodic selecao dos individuos mais aptos, segundo Vendramim & Scampini (1997).\n\nEm relacao ao percentual de adultos deformados (Fig. 3), nao foi possivel identificar efeito significativo das substancias\n\nFigure 2: Lagartas de _T. absoluta_ apos alimentacao em foliologs de tomateiro tratados com o triterpeneo 24-metilenocicolaorta-3β-ol (TRIT-1) isolado de folhas de _T. pallida_. As estas indicam o anelamento do abdome pela exivia (acima) bem como a posicão da placa protorácica por ocasião da morte das lagartas (abaixo).\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\navaliadas em comparacao aos controles (acetone e agua). Para esse parametro, como houre grande variabilidade entre as diferentes repcitoes, caracterizada pelo maior desvio (EP) em relacao as medias de traamentos, o que confere baixa preciso. Ao se avaliarem os resultados, e conveniente se considerar em trabalhos futuros um maior numero de individuos a fin de que a variabilidade observada seja minimizada. Similarmente, Bogorni & Vendramim (2005), ao avaliarem o efeito de extratos aquos de folhas e ramos de varias especies de _Trichilia_ spp., observaram grande variacao para o percentual de adultos de _S. frugiperda_ deformados, sem constatar, no entanto, a ocorrencia de diferencas significativas para esse parametro.\n\nCom base nos resultados encontrados, conclui-se que das substancias isoladas a partir do extrato em dicionmetano de _T. pallida_ (a 0,1 %), o triterpeno 24-metilenocicolaarta-3b-ol e o esteroide 24-metileno-3,22-didroxicolesterol, ambos de folhas, juntamente com o limonode gedunina de frutos, apresentam maior atividade insecticide sobre lagartas de _T. absoluta_ que as substancias 24-metilenocicolaarta-3b-26-diol; 24-metileno-colesterol; 24-metileno-3b,4b,22-tridroxicolesterol e cicioarta-23-eno-3b,25-diol. Alem do mais, o triterpeno 24-metilenocicolaarta-3b-ol, o limonode gedunina e o esteroide 24-metileno-3,22-difroxicolesterol prolongam o desenvolvimento larval e reduzen a sobrevivencia larval, mas nao afetam a duracao, a sobrevivencia e o peso de pupas de _T. absoluta_.\n\n## Agradecimentos\n\nAo Dr. Paulo Cesar Bogorni pelo auxilio na coleta e identificacao de _T. pallida_ e a Dra.

(ASTERACEAE)\n\nLuciano da S. Momesso, Cristina Y. Kawano, Patricia H. Ribeiro, Auro Nomizo, Gustavo H. Goldman e Monica T. Pupo\n\nFaculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Av. do Cafe, s/n, 14040-903 Ribeirao Preto - SP, Brasil\n\n###### Abstract\n\nOs microorganismos endofificos podem ser detectados em um momento particular associados aos tecidos aparentemente saudaveis de plantas hospedieras.1 Dentre os microorganismos endofiticos os fungos sio os mais devaliere moseidos as plantas. Eles vivem nos espacos inter ou intracellatres dos tecidos das plantas durante todo ou parte de seu ciclo de vida, sem causar sintomas aparentes de doencas.2\n\nEvidencias suggerent que os fungos endofiticos possuem grande diversidade genetica, implicando importancia pratica com relacao a desoberta de novos metabolites secundarios bioativos.3 Mutitos destes metabolites possuem um grande potencial a ser utilizado na medicina, agricultura e industria. Novos antibiotics, antimicoticos, immunosupressores e compostos anticancer sao esperados como metabolitos secundarios produzidos por endofiticos.2\n\nOs fungos endofiticos constituente una importante e ainda pouco explorada fonte de novas substancias quimicas com potencial biologico, portanto, devem ser considerados em programas de bioprospeccio.2\n\nResultados relevantes das pesquisas sobre o metabolismo secundario de fungos endofiticos incluem o isolamento do taxol, produzido por _Taxonyces andarenae_, fungo endofitico associado a _Taxus brevifolia.3_ Desde entao, uma variedade de fungos endofiticos tem sido reconnedicola pela habilidade de produzir o taxol.4 A vincristina, outro agente antinopelasico, foi isolada de un fungo amplofito nao identificao asacciado a _Catharamulus treos.5_ Outputes importantes agentes anticancer incluem a camptotecina, obtida de _Rhizopus cryzae_, fungo endofitico associado a _Nothapodytes foetida_8 e a podofilotoxina, produzida por _Philaccephala forrini_, fung endofitico de _Podophyllum pelatum_9 e tambem por _Trametes hirusta_, obtido de _Podophyllum hexandrum_.10\n\nA selecciao da planta hospediera e crucial para isolamento de fungos endofiticos e obtenacao de novos compostos bioativos. A planta deve ser selecionada principalmente com base em seu proprio meio ambiente, historico entobotonico, endemismo, longevidade e areas de maior biodiversidade.2\n\nO objetivo deste trabalho foi o isolamento, a identificacao e avaliacao biologica das substancias produzidas por _Chaetonium globosum_, fungo endofitico associado a _Viguiera robusta_ (Asteraceae), especie endemica no cerrado brasileiro. O genero _Viguiera_ e representativo da famila Asteraceae e caracteristico na producao de lactonas sesquiterpenicas com antividade antiflamatoria e diterpenos com atividade sobre musculo liso.11 _Chaetonium globosum_ foi isolado com endofitico das folhas de _V. robusta_. Esta especic caracteriza-se pela producao de citocalasanas, que apresentam diversa attividades biologica, incluindo aqico citotoxica.12-15 O cultivo de _C. globosum_ levou a loslamento das chaetoglobosinas B (**1**), D (2) e E (**3**).\n\n## Parte experimental\n\n### Procedimentos experimentalis gerais\n\nOs experimentos de RMN 1D e 2D foram obtidos em espectrometro Bruker DRX-400 operando em 400 MHz para o nucleo de 'H e 100 MHz para '1C, e em espectrometro Bruker DRX-500 operando em 500 MHz para '1H e 125 MHz para o nucleo de '1C. Os espectros de massas foram registridos em espectrometro de massas ESI-EM Micromass Quattro LC-8, no modeo _electrospryny_. As anilises rcompagridificas por CLAE no modeo analifico foram realizadas em equipamento Shimadzu SHIM-PAK com detector de arranjos dei dos, utilizando coluna analifica CLC - ODS (M) (250 x 4.6 mm). No modo preparativo, as analises por CLAE foram realizadas no mesmo aparelho, utilizando coluna semi-preparativa VP 250/10 Nucleosil 100-5 C18 (250 x 10 mm). Nas separacoes em CLAE recicalte foi utilizado equipamento Shimadzu LC-GAV (UV-SPD-10AV) e columa preparativo Shodex Asahipak GS-310 260 (500 x 15 mm). Nas separacoes rcompagridificas com abreta foram utilizadas silica gel (0,060-0,200 mm) (Merck6) e silica gel 601 osanizada (0,063-0,200 mm) (Merck6) como fases estacionarias. Nas separacoes por coluna\n\n## Page 2\n\nItojuda a vicuo (CLV) foi utilizada slica gel 60H (45 mm) (Merck(r)) como fase estacionaria.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nFolhas da especie vegetal _V. robusta_ Gardn. (Asteraceae) foram coletadas em outubro de 2002 no canteiro de plantas do Laboratorio de Farmacocgnosa da Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto - USP. Uma exsicata do material vegetal, identificado pelo Prof. Dr. J. N. Nakashima, encontra-se depositada no Herbario SPFR do Departamento de Biologia da Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras de Ribeirao Preto - USP, so codigo FBC105.\n\n## Isolamento da cepa fungica\n\nO fungo endofiltico foi isolado de folhas saudevieis _V. robusta_. As folhas foram lavadas em agua corrente e esterilizadas por imersao em etanol 70% (3 min), NaClO 5% (5 min), novanente em etanol 70% (1 min), seguidas de lavagem em agua destilada esterilizada (1 min). Apos o processo de assepsi superficial, as folhas foram cortadas em pequenos pedacos de aproximadamente 0,5 cm de diametro, os quais foram incubados em placas de Petri com meio BDA (batata dextrose agar), contendo o antibiotico tetramicina (50 mg/mL) para evitar o crescinmento de bacterias endofilacios. A especie foi identificada atraves da sequencia de rDNA e manila em silica gel (6-12 mesh) e _slants_ de BDA a 4deg C no Laboratorio de Enzimologia industrial da Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto - USP.\n\n## Identificacao do microorganismso\n\nO fungo foi crescido em meio liquido YPD (1% de extrato de l'evedura, 2% de peptona, 2% de dextrose) em mesa agitadora _shaker_ (72 h, 30 degC, 120 rpm), sendo entao filtrado a vicuo, congelado em nitrogenio liquido e estocado a -70 degC. O DNA genomico foi isolado utilizando a tecnica de extracao fenol-clorofomio e entao diluido em 100 mL de agua esterilizada 1 \\(\\mu\\)L da solucao de DNA foi utilizada para o procedimento de amplificacao. O DNA foi quantificado por espectroformaria por leiura da absorbencia entre 260-280 nm. A amplificacao dos podrotos foi verificada em gel de agarose a 1%. O par de _primers_ ITS3 e ITS4 foi utilizado para amplifier a porcao manior de rDNA 5.85 e a regiao ITS2 adjacente. A amplificacao por PCR foi realizada com um volume de 50 mL. Um \\(\\mu\\)L do DNA enomico (500 ng), 2.5 mL de dNTP 4 mM, 0.5 mL de 5U de Amplitaq platinum Taq polymerase por \\(\\mu\\)L e 5 mL de tampa 10X (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 2 mL de MgCl, 50 mM, 1 mL de primers universais ITS3 e ITS4 [2 pH 5] \\(\\%\\) mL de agua tesidales). A amplificacao foi compleada num termocicolo sob as seguintes condicoes: 94 degC por 1 min, seguid por 35 cicles do 94 degC por 1 min, 54 degC por 1 min, 54 degC por 1 min e una etapa final de 72 degC por 10 min. Os produtos de PCR foram purificados em coluna Qiagen. A analise de sequencia inteira de DNA do produto de PCR obtido com os _primers_ universais de fungos ITS3 e ITS4 especificos para genes de cDNA foi realizada para confirmar a identificacao da especie. Foi entao realizado o seztiencimento automatico em ambas as direcoes usando um _primer_ de amplificacao inicial e a sequencia alinhada de DNA resultante foi analisada com o _software_ Sequencher. A comparacao da sequencia isolada foi realizada com a sequencia presente no GenBank, utilizando busca avancada de BLAST.16\n\n## Cultivo do microorganismso e obtencao dos extratos brutos\n\n_C. globosum_ foi repicado em 13 placas de Petri contendo meio BDA e incubado por 7 das a 30 degC. A cultura fermentativa foi realizada em dua estapas. Inicialmente, 3 fragmentos de agar de aproximadamente 0.5 cm de diametro foram transfeiros das placas de Petri para cada um dos 13 frescos de Erlemmeres (1 L) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo pre-fermentativo seed,17 os quais foram mandios em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 30 degC por 48 h. Posteriormente, a mass miceli obtida foi filtrada em ambiente asseptico e transferida para 13 frescos de Erlenmeyers (2 L) contendo 400 mL de meio de culturo Czapek,18 os quais foram incubados em mesa agitadora por 144 h, a 120 rpm e 30 degC. Ambos os mesa de cultivo foram previamente submicto 3 esetrilizacao em autoclave a 121 degC e 1 atm de pressao por 15 min. Apos o termino do culturo, a cultura foi filtrada a vicuo em funil de Buchner e fluido da culturo foi submetto a particao liquido-liquido com AeOEt. A evaporacao do solvente fomeceu 600.0 mg do extrato bruto acetoettlico (CGLA).\n\n## Isolamento dos constituintes quimicos\n\nO extrato bruto CGLA (600,0 mg) foi submetido a uma CLV, utilizando-se como fase estacionaria silica gel 60H e como fases moveis hexano 100%, hexano-AcOEt 19:1, 9:1, 17:3, 4:1, 7:3, 1:1, 3:7, 1:4, 1:9, 1:19 (v/v), AcOEt 100%, MeOH-AcOEt 1: (v/v) e MeOH 100% (150 mL cada fracao), fomecendo 14 sub-fracoes. A sub-fraco CGLA2 (250,0 mg) foi submettida a uma coluna aberta utilizando-se como fase estacionaria silica gel islanizada e como fase moved aceton-aqua (1:1), fomecendo an sub-fraco 5 a subtanica 1 (25,2 mg). A sub-fraco CGLA10 (72,0 mg) foi tamben submetida a columa aberta sob as mesmas condicoes, fomecendo 8 sub-fracoes. As subfracoes CGLA10.4 (19,7 mg) e CGLA10.5 (19,0 mg) foam submefidas a CLAE reciclante em sistema isocratico MeOH 100%, fomecendo 5 e 10 sub-fracoes, respectivamente. Do fracionamento da sub-fraco CGLA10.4 foi obtida a subtanica **2** (2,0 mg) e apart da sub-fraco CGLA10.5, novanente a substancia **1** (2,0 mg). A sub-fraco CGLA11 (79,0 mg) foi submetidia a columa aberta em slica sinalizada, utilizando-se como fase movel MeOH-aqua (1:1), fomecendo 4 sub-fracoes. A sub-fraco 4 (54,1 mg) foi submetida a CLAE semi-preparativa, utilizando-se como fase estacionaria C-18, fase movel MeOH-H2O (1:1), vazao de 5 mL/min e \\(\\lambda\\), de 225 nm, fomecendo 5 sub-fracoes, dentre elas a substancia **3** (1,0 mg) e novanente as substancias **1** (1,0 mg) e 2 (1,0 mg).\n\n## Avaliacao da atividade citotoxica\n\nA substancia **1** foi submetida ao bioenasio de citotoxicidade frente as linhaagens tumorais Jurkat (teucemia T) e B16F10 (melanoma). A amostra foi solubilizada em DMSO/meio RPMI (1:100) sendo este diluente utilizado como controle negativo. Como controle postivo foi utilizado o clarotto de gemcitabine. Para avaliar atividade citotoxica foi utilizado o metodo colorimetrico de citotoxicidade pelo 3-(4,5-dimetil taxo 2:1) 2,5-dfireni brometo de tetrazolio (MTT).18 A avaliacao da atividade citotoxica foi determinada por espectrofometria, utilizando filtro de interferencia de 540 nm.\n\n## Determinacao da concentracao inibitoria minima (CIM)\n\nA concentracao inibitoria minima (CIM) foi determinada pelo metodo de microdiluicao em microplaca utilizando cloreto de trifenilletrazolio como revelador. Foram preparadas solucoes das substancias isoladas contendo 1 mg/500 mL em DMSO. Em seguida, foram transfeiros 100 mL desta solucao para tubo contendo 100 mL de calcito tripotona soja. Como a cavalído de unma alc de platina esterilizada, as culturas de 24 h dos micromagnos indicadores, desenvolvidadas no agar tripotona soja, foram transferidas para tubos contendo 10 mL de solucao salina esterilizada. Foram procedidas as diluicoes succes\n\n## Page 3\n\nsivas das suspensoes microbians (_Escherichia coli_ (ATCC25922) e _Staphylococcus aureus_ (ATCC25923)) em soluco salina a por finn em caldo triptona soja, de modo a fornreceer um inoculo de 104\\({}^{\\circ}\\)UFC/mL. Em una microplaca esterilizada de 96 offitific foli oliacdo um total de 100 mL da mistura do caldo triptona soja, da soluco da substancia **1** e das suspensoes dos microgranissmos. A substancia **1** foi avaliada em concentracoes que variaram de 400 a 1,563 ug/mL. Forum realizados tambem os controles positivo, negativo e de esterilidade do meio de cultivo. As microplacas foram incubadas a 37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C por 24 h. Posteriormente, foram adicionados em cada oriificio 40 mL de clerto de triptinletterazdo (iSigna(r)) preparado em soluco aquos (7 mg/mL). As microplaes foram reincubadas por 30 min, sendo entao observado o aparecimento de cor. A ausencia de cor nos orificios foi interpretada como ausencia de crescimento microbiano (microgranismo sensivel a amostra testada). Forum utilizados antibiotics podraro como controles positivos, penicilina G para _S. aureus_ e estreptomicina para _E. coli_.30\n\n## Resultados E discussaO\n\nO estudo quimico do extrato bruto AcOEt obido do cultivo em Czapek produzido pelo fungo endofiltico _C. globosum_ resultou no isolamento de tres etiocalasanas **(1-3)**. A identificacao destas substancias fo realizada com base dos endoscopes obtidos (RMN 1\\({}^{\\text{H}}\\) e 1\\({}^{\\text{C}}\\), DEPT, gCOSY \\({}^{\\text{H}}\\)-H, gHMQC, gHMQC e EM) e comparacao con dados disponiveis na literatura.31,23 As citocalasanas sao microtoxins que se caracterizan quimicamente pela presenca de um anel peridroisoindol-1-ona alamente substitudo e fundido a um anel macrof cclico (Figure 1). A naturoza do substituinte em C-3 indica o aminocido que origionu a citocalasana, atraves da ligacao com a cada policedtica precursora dos aneis peridroisoindol-1-ona e macroficco. Quando a ciucolasana e biosinteriazda a partir do triptofano, a sub-classe de metabolites de denominada chaciedobosians.21 Fenilalamina (originaudo citocalasinas) e leucina sao aminocidos que frequentemente sao tambem encontrados nas citocalasanas.\n\nAs principais caracteristicas estruturais do anel macrocilico, em geral de 11 ou 13 membros, incluem presenca de ate tres e oxidacos en 300\\({}^{\\circ}\\)Cen C-19 (alcool ou ectona), C-20 (alcool ou ectona) c-C-22 (galacine cetona); presenca de a teris figacos deplaa (13,14, 21\\({}^{\\circ}\\)S, \\(\\Delta^{12,25}\\)), presenca de perquamento metcilos em C-16 (Me-24) e C-18 (Me-25). No anel perforisoindol-1-ona as principais modificacoes estruturais encontradas sao presenca de ligacao dupla A56, \\(\\Delta^{12,20}\\) ou \\(\\Delta^{57,25}\\) presenca de epoxido entre C-6 e C-7; presenca de hidroxila em C-7; presenca de grupamentos metcilicos em C-5 (Me-11) e C-6 (Me-12). Mais de 30 chaciedobosinas jafar from isoladas e identificadas, e os dados de difracao de raios-X permitiram o estabeccimento da estrutura cristadorizada chaciedobosinas.22 Portanto, apexa dal 300\\({}^{\\circ}\\)L, aT18, complexidade estrutural destas substancias, e relativamente simples identificar a classe quimica com base na analise dos dados de RMN 1\\({}^{\\text{H}}\\) e 1\\({}^{\\text{C}}\\), e, atraves da comparacao com os dados da literatura,31,23 estabelecer a estrutura da chaciedobosina.\n\nA analise dos dados de RMN 1\\({}^{\\text{H}}\\), RMN 1\\({}^{\\text{C}}\\) (32 sinais) e EM ([M+H]\\({}^{\\text{+}}\\) 529) possibilita a proposicao de formula molecular C\\({}_{3}\\)H\\({}_{\\text{u}}\\)N\\({}_{\\text{O}}\\), para a substancia **1** (DDH 16) (Figure 1). O espectro de RMN 1\\({}^{\\text{H}}\\) apresento suiais caracteristicos de chaciedobosinas. Os sinais do anel indolic do triptofano foram observados em 8 25\\(\\left(\\text{sl},\\text{NH}\\right)\\); 7.51 (dl, \\(J\\) = 8,1 Hz, H-4\\({}^{\\circ}\\)), 7.38 (dl, \\(J\\) = 8,1 Hz, H-7\\({}^{\\circ}\\)), 7.16 (s, H-2\\({}^{\\circ}\\)), 7.09 (ddd, \\(J\\) = 8,1; 7.8; 1.0 Hz, H-6\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) e 7.01 (ddd, \\(J\\) = 8,1; 7.8; 1.0 Hz, H-5\\({}^{\\circ}\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nOs dados de RMN 'H e 13C para as substancias **1**-**3 estao apresentados na Tabela 1. As cheatedglobosina ja foram isoladas das culturas de diversos fungs de solo, fitropatogenes, de ambiente hospitalar e de colegces comercias, pertenentenes aos generos _Cabonectaria_,24 Cylindrocladium_,25 Discosia_,25 Ipdolaz_,26 Penicillium?_Phomopsis.28 Porem, a maioria das cheatedglobosinas foi isolada de especies de _Chaetomium_.29 Recentemente, as cheatedglobosinas C, F, E, e pencocalasina A, alem da nova cheatedglobosina U, foram tambem isoladas de una cepa endofifica de _C. globosum_. Novas cheatedglobosinas continuam a ser identificadas de fungos de solo59 e marinhos.30 Citocalasans derivadas da fenialadina foram recentemente isoladas de fungo endofificio no Brasil.31\n\nAs citocalasanas sao reconhecidas por suas notaveis attivadades biologicas. O nome citocalasana tem origem nas palavras gregas _cytos_ (cclula) e _chalasis_ (relaxacao) e refere-se aos efeitios celular.

As Figuras 2 e 3 ilustram os resultados obtidos nos ensaios, que monostarrama a elevada atividade citotoxica edsta substancia frente as células tumorais. As chaetoglobosinas C, F, E, U, e pencolasiana, isoladas de cepa endofifica de _C. globosum_, tambem apresentaram acao citotoxica na linhagem tumoral humana KB.32 Citocalasanas derivadas da fenila-lanina, obtidas de fungos do genero _Phoma_, tambem apresentaram atividade frente a celulas FT210 de carcinoma de rato33 e frente a linhagem tumoral humana HT29.34\n\nA atividade antibiotica da substancia I foi avaliada pelo metodo de microdiluicao com a finalidade de determinar a concentracao inibitofria minima (CIM) frente a _S. aureus_ e _E. coli_. A substancia **1** apresenton fraca atividade antibacteriala, com CIM de 120 mg/mL para _S. aureus_ e CIM de 189 mg/mL para _E. coli_.\n\nA maioria das atividades biologicas descritas para as chaetoglobosinas foi avaliada em modelos _in vitro_,12,15 Ensaios de toxicidade experimental em modelos animais sao menos numerososos, mas evidenciaram que a cheatoglobosina A apresentou toxicidade apos admistracao por via oral 8 vezes inferior quando comparada a administracao por via parenteral.21\n\nAs chaetoglobosinas A e C, juntamente com outras micotoxinas, agentes quimicos e particulados, tem sido apontadas como responsaveis pela diminuicao da qualidade do ar em interiores, causando a \"Sindrome dos Edificios Doentes\".33 Ainda, as chaetoglobosinas A e C foram detectadas em produtos derivados de frutas? e castanhas36 contaminados com especies de longoer _Phoenix_.\n\nA elevada citotoxicidade dificula a utilizacao das citocalasanas como candidatos a prototipos para o desenvolvimento de farmacos.
