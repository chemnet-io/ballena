Casearin X degraded to the corresponding dialdehyde when stored in CDCl3. The diterpenes isolated were cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines, with caseargrewiin F being the most active and the new clerodane, casearin X, the second active compound with IC50 values comparable to the positive control doxorubicin. All isolated diterpenes showed lower activities against normal human cells than against cancer cell lines, which might indicate a possible selective action on cancer cells. Casearin X dialdehyde was not cytotoxic to cancer cells indicating that the occurrence of these CO groups at C(18) and C(19) is incompatible with the cytotoxic activity. Introduction. – Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae), commonly known as guaÅatonga, is widely distributed in the form of a shrub or tree throughout South America, but especially within the Atlantic and Amazon forests and the Cerrado biomes of Brazil [1]. The plant is of considerable scientific interest by virtue of its extensive use in popular and traditional medicine for the treatment of snake bites and in wound healing, and also as an anti-ulcer, anti-pyretic, and topical antiseptic [2][3]. Pharmacological studies on leaf extracts of C. sylvestris have confirmed anti- ulcerogenic [4][5], anti-inflammatory [6], antivenom [7][8], and cytotoxic activities [9][10]. Additionally, no significant toxicological effects have been observed following oral administration of EtOH extracts of C. sylvestris leaves to animals [4], and no genotoxicity was detected when such extracts were assayed against hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) and lung fibroblast V-79 cells [11]. Phytochemical investigations of various species of Casearia have revealed the presence of a series of oxygenated tricyclic cis-clerodane diterpenes in which the tetrahydrofuran ring bears two acyloxy groups at C(18) and C(19) [12–21]. Such compounds are reportedly unstable under acidic conditions and readily degrade to form the corresponding dialdehyde [16]. The casearins A–T, isolated from the leaves CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 205 2010 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zrich of C. sylvestris, represent a group of diterpenes of this type that are cytotoxic to V-79 cells in transgenic Chinese hamsters, 180A sarcoma cells implanted into rats, and mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [9][10][17]. A number of related diterpenes, the casearvestrins A–C, have been isolated from the leaves and branches of C. sylvestris and found to exhibit anti-fungal activity against Aspergillus niger and cytotoxicity against human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cell lines [18], whilst the roots of the same plant contain a similar type of diterpene with trypanosomicidal properties [19]. Moreover, less complex clerodane diterpenes, such as (þ)-15-hydroxy- 3-cleroden-2-one and ()-hardwickiic acid [20], have been identified in the leaves of C. sylvestris. These compounds differ from the casearins with respect to the pattern of oxygenation and also in the configuration of the A/B ring junction, and between the Me(17) and Me(20) groups. It thus appears that C. sylvestris can biosynthesize both cis- and trans-clerodane diterpenoids, a characteristic that is common to various other species including Adelanthus lindenbergianus (Adelhantaceae) and Grangea mader- aspatana (Asteraceae) [22][23]. In the present article, we report on the isolation of five casearins (including the new casearin X (1)) and of caseargrewiin F (6) from the EtOH extracts of the leaves of C. sylvestris, and on the formation of the degradation product of casearin X, 7. The structures of the compounds were determined from spectrometric data and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. The cytotoxicities of these compounds against human cancer and normal cell lines are also reported. Results and Discussion. – Isolation and Structure Determination. Fractionation of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. sylvestris by solid-phase extraction (SPE) from silica gel/activated charcoal, followed by normal-phase low pressure column chroma- tography (LPCC) over silica gel and preparative reversed-phase (C18) HPLC, allowed the purification of a new clerodane diterpene (1) together with the known compounds 2–6 [9][10][21]. CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 206 1) Arbitrary numbering. For systematic names, see Exper. Part. Compound 1, obtained as a white powder, was submitted to high-resolution time-of- flight-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-TOF-ESI-MS) in the positive- ion mode and exhibited [MþNa]þ and [MþK]þ ions with masses 555.2931 and 571.2659, respectively, that were consistent with the values 555.2928 and 571.2668, respectively, calculated on the basis of an empirical formula of C30H44O8 for the molecular ion. The 13C-NMR of 1 presented 30 signals that were similar to those reported for other casearins [9][10][17][20]. A broad band in the IR at 3490 cm1, together with 13C- and 1H-NMR signals at d(C) 72.9 (C(6)1)) and d(H) 4.16 (dd, J¼ 11.0, 5.0; HC(6)), respectively, indicated the presence of a HOCH group in the molecule. Similarly, an IR absorbance at 1752 cm1 and 13C signals at d(C) 170.0, 173.3, and 173.4 suggested the presence of one AcO and two butanoate ester groups, respectively (Table 1). The absorption band at 235 nm in the UV spectrum is characteristic of a conjugated diene in the side chain of the casearins [9][10][17][20], the presence of which was confirmed from signals observed in the olefinic region of the 1H-NMR showing cis/trans coupling of the CH2 H-atoms of a terminal monosubstituted C¼C bond (d(H) 5.11 (d, J¼11.0, HaC(15)1)), 5.24 (d, J¼17.0, HbC(15))) with the vicinal H-atom (d(H) 6.79 (dd, J¼17.0, 11.0, HC(14))), and a signal at d(H) 5.62 (d, J¼9.0, HC(12)) which could be attributed to the H-atom attached to a trisubstituted C¼C bond of a conjugated diene. The partial structure formed by the side chain linked at C(9) was confirmed from the observed HMBC correlations between HC(11) and C(12), HC(12) and C(13)/C(16), HC(14) and C(16), HC(15) and C(13), and Me(16) and C(13), together with the COSY correlations shown in the Figure. The (Z)- configuration of the C¼C bond at C(12) was determined on the basis of the nuclear Overhauser (NOESY) effect observed between Me(16) and HC(12). The signals of the O-bearing CH groups at d(C) 97.3 (C(18)) and 99.2 (C(19)), and of the two H-atoms at d(H) 7.14 (s, HC(19)) and 7.43 (t, J¼1.5, HC(18)) indicated the existence of a diacetal system in the C ring. Moreover, HMBCs (Figure) between HC(18) and the CO group of one butanoate group (d(C) 173.4), and between Figure. Selected HMBC and COSY correlations observed for 11) CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 207 HC(19) and the CO group of an AcO group (d(C) 170.0) defined the positions of these substituents. The second butanoate group was attached to the C-atom displaying a signal at d(C) 67.4 (C(2)). The relative configurations at the eight stereogenic centers were determined from 13C-NMR spectral data, 1H-NMR coupling constants, and the results of NOE and NOESY experiments. The cis-configuration of the A/B ring junction was deduced from the chemical shift (d(C) 25.5) of the Me(20) group in accordance with previous reports [15][24][25]. The chemical shifts of C(5) and C(10) (d(C) 54.8 and 37.7, resp.) were similar to those described for the casearins and analogous compounds [9][10][26]. Moreover, the values of the coupling constants (J¼3.5 and 13.5 Hz) of the doublet of doublets at d(H) 2.74 suggested that HC(10) was in axial orientation.

Overhauser (NOESY) effects between HC(10) and HC(12), and HC(11) and HC(19), indicated a similar orientation for the side chain at C(9). In general, cis-clerodane diterpenes that are not substituted at positions C(7), C(8), C(10), C(11), and C(12) exhibit chemical shifts around d(C) 15.0 and 26.0 for the Me(17) and Me(20) groups, respectively, in the trans configuration [13][26–28], and values of ca. d(C) 16.0 and 18.0, respectively, for Me(17) and Me(20) groups in the cis configuration [20][21][28–30]. Casearins substituted at C(7) present chemical shifts for the Me(17) and Me(20) groups of ca. d(C) 11.0 and 26.0, respectively, which are most likely caused by the g shielding effect of the O-bearing substituent at C(7) [9][10]. Casearvestrins are not substituted at C(7), which explains the chemical shift value of d(C) 15.6 reported for C(17) [18]. In the case of 1, which has no substituent at C(7), the signals at d(C) 16.1 and 25.5 (associated with the Me(17) and Me(20) groups, resp.) indicate a trans relationship between Me(17) and Me(20). The chemical shift of d(C) 67.4 for the O-bearing HC(2) group, and the coupling constant observed for the allylic H-atom HC(2) (d(H) 5.71, t, J¼4.5), are consistent with a b-pseudo-equatorial orientation of HC(2) [13][19][26]. Furthermore, the observed nuclear Overhauser (NOESY) effects between HC(2) and HbC(1) (d(H) 2.10–2.14 (m)), and HC(6) and HbC(1), suggest that these H-atoms possess the same b-orientation. The 1,2-diaxial coupling of HC(6) with CH2(7), implied by the value of the coupling constant (11.0 Hz) for HC(6), confirms the a-equatorial position of the OH group. The observed homoallylic coupling (5J) between HC(18) (d(H) 7.43 (t, J¼1.5)) and HC(2) requires that the p-orbitals of the C¼C bond overlap with the 1s orbitals of the H-atoms thus implying a b-orientation for HC(18) [12]. Finally, the nuclear Overhauser effect between HC(18) and HC(19) confirms the a-orientation of the butanoate group at C(18) and the AcO group at C(19). The 13C-NMR data (recorded in (D5)pyridine) for 2 (C31H44O10), 3 (C30H44O9), 4 (C29H42O9), 5 (C33H48O10), and 6 (C28H40O8) were comparable with those previously determined in CDCl3 [9][10][21]. Additional spectral data (UV, IR, HR-MS, 1H-NMR, HMQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY) confirmed the structures of these compounds. Formation and Structure Elucidation of Casearin X Dialdehyde 7. Some authors have reported, on the basis of NMR experiments, that clerodane diterpenes similar to the casearins are unstable in CHCl3 and undergo opening of the diacetal ring with the formation of an 18,19-dialdehyde [16][18]. In this context, the caseamembrins F, J, and K isolated from C. membranaceae which are considered to be natural products [14][26], are most likely artefacts generated by the use of CHCl3. In the present study, the NMR spectra of 1 measured in CDCl3 presented signals of two aldehydic H-atoms replacing the H-atoms of the diacetal ring. When the stability over a period of one month of 1 dissolved in five different deuterated solvents (i.e. CDCl3, (D6)DMSO, (D6)acetone, CD3OD, and (D5)pyridine) was studied, degradation was detected only in CDCl3. It is probable that the formation of 7 from 1 was promoted by traces of acid present in CDCl3 [16], and for this reason all further NMR experiments were conducted with (D5)pyridine as solvent. Compound 7, obtained as a white powder, exhibited an [MþH]þ ion in the positive-ion mode HR-TOF-ESI-MS with a mass of 403.2484 that was consistent with the value of 403.2484 calculated on the basis of an empirical formula of C24H34O5 for CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 209 the molecular ion. The difference in the molecular formulae of 1 and 7 was consistent with the loss of a butanoate and an AcO group and the formation of a dialdehyde at positions 18 and 191). The 13C-NMR data (including DEPT-135) of the dialdehyde recorded in CDCl3 were similar to those of 1 measured in (D5)pyridine, except of the signals of the diacetal C-atoms at C(18) and C(19) which were substituted by signals associated with aldehydic CO groups with signals at d(C) 195.7 (d) and 202.6 (d), respectively. Similar differences were observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum in which the signals associated with HC(18) and HC(19) appeared in the aldehydic region, i.e., d(H) 9.92 (d, J¼2.0) and 9.38 (s), respectively. The structure and relative configuration of 7 was determined on the basis of data derived from 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments (1H, 13C, DEPT-135 and -90, HMQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY) in a manner similar to that described above for casearin X. Compound 7 is an isomer of caseanigrescens D-2, a degradation product of caseanegrescens D from C. Nigrescens [16], and the two aldehydes differ only with respect to the position of the conjugated diene in the side chain, being D12,14 in the former and D13(16),14 in the latter. Cytotoxicity against Tumor Cell Lines. The isolated compounds 1–7 were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against the four human tumor cell lines MOLT-4 (leukaemia), MDA-MB-435 (melanoma), HCT-8 (colon), and SF-295 (glyoblastoma), and against L-929 (normal fibroblasts). The IC50 values displayed in Table 2 reveal that 6 was the most active of the compounds tested, showing stronger cytotoxicity against all tumor cell lines (IC50<0.2 mm) compared to normal L-929 cells (IC50¼1.09 mm). These values are quite similar to those obtained to the positive control doxorubicin, that presented IC50 values ranging from 0.02 to 0.83 mm to tumor cells, and 1.2 mm to L-929 cells. Considering the selectivity towards tumor cells, compound 6 was 12.1 times more active against MOLT-4 cells than against L-929, while doxorubicin was 24 times. However, if it was considered for example breast and glyoblastoma cells, while doxorubicin was only 1.4 and 3.0 times more active in tumor cells, 6 was 8.4 and 6.4 times more active, respectively. In the previous evaluation of cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines, compound 6 was inactive against KB cells (oral epidermoid carcinoma), showed significant cytotoxicity against BC1 cells (human breast cancer) and minor activity against NCI-H187 cells (human small cell lung cancer) [21]. Further studies are necessary to establish the selectivity profile for this compound. Whilst 1 is not as cytotoxic as 6, it exhibited a good anti-proliferative potential against tumor cells (IC50< 1 mm). Compounds 2–5 displayed only moderate cytotoxicities, although it is worth noting that, in every case, cytotoxicity against normal cells was lower than that against tumor cells, indicating a possible selective action on cancer cells. Compound 7, on the other hand, was ineffective against most of the tumor lines. Additionally, none of the compounds tested caused haemolysis even at the highest concentration (200 mg/ml), suggesting that the mechanism of cytotoxicity is probably related to a more specific pathway. Cytotoxic activities against human tumor cell lines have been studied for other clerodane diterpene 18,19-dialdehydes obtained from species of Casearia. Thus, caseamembrin F was found to be cytotoxic to PC-3 (prostate cancer) cells but not to Hep3B (hepatoma) cells [26]. Moreover, the caseamembrins J and K exhibited no cytotoxicity against KB (oral epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (cervical epithelial CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 210 CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 211 Table 2.

It would appear, therefore, that the presence of the dialdehyde function in these clerodane diterpenes results in the total or partial loss of cytotoxicity indicating that the occurrence of the CO groups at positions 18 and 19 is incompatible with the cytotoxic activity. In addition, the lack of an AcO group at C(6) and the lack of an O-bearing function at C(7) in the strongest active compounds (casearin X and caseargrewiin F) agree with the discussion of SAR in previous reports [10][14]. In conclusion, caseargrewiin F and the new compound casearin X showed relevant cytotoxic activity against the leukemia, melanoma, colon, and glyoblastoma cancer cell lines, comparable with the positive control doxorubicin. In addition, the lower activities of these compounds against normal human cells can be indicative of a selective action on cancer cells.

Leaves of Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) were collected at the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (Sa˜o Miguel Arcanjo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens are deposited with the Herbarium Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann (Instituto Botaˆnico do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13, and AGS19. Extraction and Isolation of Compounds 1–6. Dried and powdered leaves of C. sylvestris (20.5 kg) were extracted with EtOH (ca. 200 l) in a stainless steel extractor with solvent re-circulation for ca. 24 h at 408. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 1540.0 g of dry residue. A portion (473.6 g) of the residue was separated by SPE from SiO2 (60–200 mm, Merck)/activated charcoal (Synth) (1:1, w/w) by elution with hexane/AcOEt (95 :5, v/v), AcOEt, and MeOH to afford three fractions (SPE1–SPE3). SPE2 (16.0 g) was submitted to normal-phase LPCC over SiO2 (40–63 mm; Merck) eluted with a gradient of hexane/AcOEt/iPrOH of increasing polarity (78 :20.5 :1.5 to 60 :37.3 :2.7, v/v/v): 45 fractions were collected and monitored by TLC, anal. HPLC-UV, and NMR. Frs. 5, 6, 8, 9, 15–19, 25, and 31–36 were submitted to prep. reversed-phase HPLC (C18 column) with CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 212 MeOH/H2O mixtures as the mobile phase to yield 1 (1250.0 mg), 2 (250.6 mg), 3 (80.0 mg), 4 (43.0 mg), 5 (128.5 mg), and 6 (850.0 mg). Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxic potential of the isolated compounds and doxorubicin was evaluated by the MTT assay [31] against five cell lines (MOLT-4, MDA-MB-435, HCT-8, SF-295, and L- 929) obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 U/ml penincillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, at 378 with 5% CO2. Tumor cell growth was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.7105 cells/ well for adherent cells and 0.3105 cells/well for suspended cells) and the compounds (0.019–25 mg/ml) were added to each well. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT 0.5 mg/ml. After 3 h, the plates were centrifuged, and the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 ml DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin was used as pos. control. Statistical Analysis. The IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA), from three independent experiments. Haemolytic Assay. The isolated compounds were assayed for haemolytic activity at concentrations in the range 1.56–200 mg/ml according to the method of Moreira et al. [32]. Analytes were incubated in 96- well plates for 60 min at r.t. with suspensions of mouse erythrocytes (2%) in NaCl (0.85%) containing 10 mm CaCl2. Following centrifugation, the levels of haemoglobin in the supernatants were determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm.
