A study of the endophytic fungi associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing 186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of _Nigrospora sphaerica_ and _Phoma betae_ liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential compounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-b-ol diterpene is being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including GC/MS, homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe Asteraceae _Smallanthus sonchifolus_ (Poepp. and Endl.) H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. Some unique substances like the anti-microbial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones [1-3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF2-9), but deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South America, New Zealand and Japan [4-7]. The plant is also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal colonization.\\n\\nInteractions involving plants and fungi are quite complex. They may have qualitatively different relationships with a single host plant, from parasitism to mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are considered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages none of the partners, including the absence of external manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated fungi may produce substances with specific functions inside and outside the host plant in which they normally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anti-cancer [9].\\n\\nAs part of the bioprostecting program in endophytic fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10-13], it was considered that _S. sonchifolus_, commonly named Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\nbioactive secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and biotechnological purposes. Using this approach, 32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds. Some of the compounds isolated in this research are being reported for the first time as secondary metabolites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant associations is discussed.\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\n\\n### Isolation, identification and preservation of fungal strains\\n\\nYacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in February 2006, in the city of Ribeirao Preto (S 21deg11.933' NO 47deg46.699'), State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirao Preto _campus_, University of Sao Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\\n\\nThe collected plant material was washed with running tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were carried out by sequentially submerging the plant material in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were excised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA medium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 mg/ml) and incubated initially at 30 degC for 48 h, followed by 72 h at 23 degC. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures. Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure cultures were obtained.\\n\\nConidia producing strains were identified at the Department of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil. Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 degC in tubes containing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers onto PDA slants at 4 degC.\\n\\n### Cultivation and extraction procedures\\n\\nTwo culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for cultivation and screening of biological activities of the isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures.\\n\\nLiquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1). First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incubated at 30 degC for 7 d. After this period, aqueous suspensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 degC for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step, this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Buchner filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This procedure was carried out for a small scale extract production for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cultures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH, followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro\\n\\nFigure 1: Schematic outline of endophytic fungi cultivation and extraction procedures (experimental details in text “Cultivation and extraction procedures”).\\n\\n\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\nduce the mycelial ethanolic extract (EtM). An Erlenmeyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek medium and treated in the same way for control purposes.\\n\\nFor the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled water per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 degC for 40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation, one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about \\\\(2 \\\\times 2\\\\) cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incubation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 degC, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and the residual fraction (RS).\\n\\n### Isolation of compounds\\n\\nEaS fraction (20.2 g) of _Nigrospora sphaerica_ was fractionated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column (22.0 x 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents (step A, Fig. 2). Fraction M2EaS (9.9 g) was fractionated over silica gel column (CC, 230-80 mesh, 26.0 x 4.5 cm) using a gradient from with hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to MeOH (100%; step B) to provide 22 fractions. Fraction 13 (30.1 mg) was identified as compound **1**. Fraction M1EaS (3.1 g) was crystallized from a heated solution of MeOH/H2O 9:1 yielding compound **3** (101.0 mg; Fig. 2). Fraction EEaS (1.64 g) chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 25.5 x 5.0 cm) and eluted with the same gradient as above mentioned (step C) produced 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (246.6 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 28.0 x 3.0 cm) and using a gradient from hexane: EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%; step D) to yield 9 fractions. Fraction 6 (46.3 mg) was rechromatographed again on silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 20.0 x 1.3 cm) using the same gradient elution (step E) to yield compound **2** (16.9 mg).\\n\\n_N. sphaerica_ fraction EaL (474.3 mg) was fractionated over silica gel (CC, 400-200 mesh, 24.0 x 3.5 cm) by elution with gradient hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%; step F) yielding 7 fractions. Fraction 7 crystallized spontaneously to afford compound **3** (98.0 mg).\\n\\nFraction EaS (16.5 g) originated from 20 day cultures of _Phoma betae_ (19 flasks) was chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 11.0 x 12.0 cm) under gradient elution from hexane:EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step G; Fig. 3) to afford 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (686.7 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 25.0 x 4.0 cm) by using gradient elution from hexane:EtOAc (8:2) to MeOH (100%; step H) to\\n\\nFigure 3: Schematic outline of isolation of compounds from _Phoma betae_.

Fraction 4 (Pb-4, 21.9 mg) was submitted to HPLC using an isocratic solvent system containing hexane: EtOAc (9:1) delivered to the a semi-prep Nucleosil 100-7 column (250 x 10 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1, and monitored at 254 nm detection wavelength at 25 degC (step K). Compound 4 (12.1 mg) was collected at 41 min. The residual fraction (5.0 mg) collected at 45 min was resubmitted to HPLC employing a prep C18 Shimadzu column (250 x 20 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min-1, using MeOH as eluent, and monitored at 254 nm (step L). Compound 5 (0.6 mg) was collected at 28 min. Fraction 13 (Pb-13, 426.8 mg) was chromatographed over sephadex LH-20 column (60.0 x 2.5 cm) using EtOH as eluent (step M) to afford 7 fractions. Fraction 4 crystallized spontaneously to yield compound 6 (18.8 mg; step N).\\n\\n### Spectroscopic data of compound 1\\n\\nPimara-7,15-dien-3b-ol (1): white powder; molecular formula: C20H32O; [a]50-3.7deg (_c_ 2.15, CHCl3); EI/MS _m/z_ (rel. int.): 288 (30), 273 (60), 255 (100), 187 (38), 145 (35), 119 (55), 107 (70), 91 (55), 80 (48), 55 (42); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): d 5.69 (1H, dd, J = 10.8 and 18.0 Hz, H-15), 5.10 (1H, m, H-7), 4.82 (1H, dd, J = 1.5 and 18.0 Hz, H-16a), 4.79 (1H, dd, J = 1.5 and 10.4 Hz, H-16b), 3.13 (1H, dd, J = 4.4 and 11.6 Hz, H-3), 0.90 (3H, s, Me-18), 0.89 (3H, s, Me-19), 0.73 (3H, s, Me-20); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): d 39.2 (C-1), 29.1 (C-2), 79.0 (C-3), 37.1 (C-4), 52.8 (C-5 and 9), 35.8 (C-6), 113.2 (C-7), 38.9 (C-10 and 12), 20.9 (C-11), 35.2 (C-13), 44.1 (C-14), 145.4 (C-15), 110.8 (C-16), 28.1 (C-17), 35.6 (C-18), 21.6 (C\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n_folius_ tissues possibly demonstrating tissue specificity. Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization and five other species occurred simultaneously in two tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42, SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots. Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture conditions employed. They remain unidentified and were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated were identified by traditional taxonomical methods based on morphological features as established in Table 1.\\n\\nThe isolated genera _Drechslera_, _Fusarium_, _Phoma_, _Alternaria_, _Curvularia_, _Nigrospora_, _Glomerella_ and _Aspergillus_ have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a range of hosts [18-20]. They also have proven to be endophytes in several plant species [21-26] strengthening the argument that disease is an exception in the plant-microbe interaction, which could be more properly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis [27]. Genus _Papulaspora_ is a well-known competitive soil mold in the culture of mushrooms [28, 29] and it has just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few species as _Vitex negundo_[24], _Manilkara bidentata_[30], _Taxus chinensis_[31], _Amomum siamense_[32] and _Solanum tuberosum_[25]. _Preussia_, however, is recognized either as a soil or a coprophilous genus [33, 34] but has never been mentioned before as an endophyte.\\n\\n### Cytotoxic activity of extracts\\n\\nFrom the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL and RS were practically inactive (data not shown).

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetate fractions from both culture types of _P. immersa_ (SS13), _N. sphaerica_ (SS67) and _A. tenuissima_ (SS77) produced good results on all tested cells indicating that production of bioactive molecules by these fungi does not depend on the culture medium employed. These observations emphasize the significance of these species in future biotechnology studies.\\n\\n### Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance of isolated compounds\\n\\n_N. sphaerica_ (SS67) and _P. betae_ (SS84) were chosen for large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive compounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts.\\n\\nThree substances were isolated from the _N. sphaerica_ EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound **1** was identified as pimara-7,15-dien-3b-ol, compound **2** as ergosterol peroxide and compound **3** as aphidicolin. Spectral data of compound **2** were in agreement with literature data [35], while compound **1**, recently detected in a plant essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36]. This is the first report of compound **1** obtained from a fungal source and having its structure completely elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds **1** and **2** showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested (Table 3).\\n\\nCompound **3**, isolated from the EaL fraction of _N. sphaerica_ (SS67) had its structure established as the diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR data that are in agreement with reported data [37]. Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \\\\hline\\n**Fungus** & **Cell growth inhibition (\\\\%)** & & & & & \\\\\\\\ \\\\cline{2-7}  & HCT-8 & MDA-MB435 & & & & \\\\\\\\ \\\\cline{2-7}  & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline SS13 & 100.0 (HA) & 54.5 (MA) & 95.2 (HA) & 81.3 (HA) & 98.1 (HA) & 34.2 \\\\\\\\ SS16 & 32.0 & 1.6 & 31.3 & 25.7 & 35.7 & 4.1 \\\\\\\\ SS20 & NC & 10.3 & NC & 11.0 & NC & 4.1 \\\\\\\\ SS21 & 27.2 & I & 37.0 & 1 & 23.3 & 10.9 \\\\\\\\ SS22 & 100.0 (HA) & I & 100.0 (HA) & 11.8 & 100.0 (HA) & 1 \\\\\\\\ SS26 & 31.9 & 19.9 & 17.1 & 15.9 & 41.2 & 24.9 \\\\\\\\ SS29 & 40.1 & 68.0 (MA) & 60.6 (MA) & 27.9 & 33.1 & 62.9 (MA) \\\\\\\\ SS32 & 56.6 (MA) & 33.7 & 20.0 & 33.0 & 47.7 & 15.1 \\\\\\\\ SS33 & 86.7 (HA) & 3.6 & 71.2 (MA) & I & 84.5 (HA) & I \\\\\\\\ SS36 & 52.4 (MA) & 35.3 & 38.7 & 44.7 & 49.0 & 19.7 \\\\\\\\ SS40 & 3.6 & I & 10.7 & 1 & 12.0 & I \\\\\\\\ SS42 & 30.9 & 41.0 & 36.3 & 52.0 (MA) & 21.2 & 27.1 \\\\\\\\ SS43 & 33.9 & 54.2 (MA) & 49.2 & 59.4 (MA) & 25.0 & 54.5 (MA) \\\\\\\\ SS44 & 62.7 (MA) & 23.3 & 50.7 (MA) & 12.1 & 48.1 & 3.2 \\\\\\\\ SS46 & 85.6 (HA) & 13.0 & 83.2 (HA) & 30.3 & 85.8 (HA) & 9.7 \\\\\\\\ SS50 & 30.2 & I & 57.9 (MA) & I & 12.3 & I \\\\\\\\ SS55 & 55.3 (MA) & I & 1 & I & 14.2 & I \\\\\\\\ SS62 & 99.8 (HA) & 27.2 & 51.4 (MA) & 32.2 & 67.5 (MA) & 31.8 \\\\\\\\ SS65 & NC & 1.4 & NC & 10.8 & NC & 14.2 \\\\\\\\ SS67 & 79.2 (HA) & 86.2 (HA) & 48.2 & 41.9 & 73.0 (MA) & 82.2 (HA) \\\\\\\\ SS68 & 39.2 & 55.2 (MA) & 36.4 & 23.3 & 26.9 & 54.4 (MA) \\\\\\\\ SS70 & 22.1 & 32.8 & 32.1 & 41.7 & 18.5 & 18.9 \\\\\\\\ SS73 & 28.4 & I & 6.6 & I & 9.1 & I \\\\\\\\ SS74 & 24.6 & 83.9 (HA) & I & 81.0 (HA) & 8.4 & 71.3 (MA) \\\\\\\\ SS75 & 19.5 & 22.2 & 41.0 & 4.9 & 7.4 & 28.1 \\\\\\\\ SS76 & 100.0 (HA) & 48.9 & 42.6 & 30.4 & 52.7 (MA) & 40.3 \\\\\\\\ SS77 & 94.7 (HA) & 72.9 (MA) & 82.0 (HA) & 53.0 (MA) & 78.3 (HA) & 69.2 (MA) \\\\\\\\ SS78 & 4.9 & I & 19.3 & 3.3 & 6.4 & I \\\\\\\\ SS79 & 26.2 & 5.1 & 1 & 12.4 & 8.4 & I \\\\\\\\ SS82 & 87.6 (HA) & 9.1 & 45.7 & 1.4 & 68.2 (MA) & I \\\\\\\\ SS83 & 49.3 & 8.8 & 27.7 & 32.5 & 51.0 (MA) & 16.5 \\\\\\\\ SS84 & 100.0 (HA) & 12.4 & 92.4 (HA) & 10.1 & 95.6 (HA) & 15.0 \\\\\\\\ control & 25.9 & 2.2 & 34.6 & 20.1 & 25.1 & 4.7 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{table}\\nTable 2: Cytotoxic activity of the ethyl acetate fractions from liquid (EaL) and solid (EaS) cultures of the endophytic fungi isolated from _Smalanthus sonchitolius_.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\nagainst all cell lines (Table 3), but its direct _in vivo_ administration is difficult due to its poor water solubility and fast metabolization.

In liquid potato-sucrose medium, _P. betae_ is reported to produce an assortment of bioactive diterpenes [40, 41], including aphidicolin (3), an specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resultant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1H NMR techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only compound **2** was isolated corroborating the initial low activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day cultures yielded compound **6**, which was identified as dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines tested. The subfraction 1H NMR spectrum revealed a mixture of two substances in a 1:1 ratio, later separated and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (compound **4**) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl-isocumarin (compound **5**) in accordance with literature data (Fig. 4) [43, 44]. When compounds **4** and **5** were tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities, respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound **4** against other tumor cell lines had been previously described [45, 46] but the results in this report suggest that isocoumarin (compound **5**) and ergosterol (compound **4**) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating or improving either the therapeutic effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs [47, 48] or radiotherapy [49]. Our results suggest that compounds **4** and **5** might be considered as hits for drug development of a novel anti-cancer combination therapy.\\n\\nThe amounts of pesticides employed in _S. sonchifolius_ cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes _P. betae_ and _N. sphaerica_ and their host have similar biosynthetic pathways [52, 53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). _N. sphaerica_ is also known to cause both reduction of spore germination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic fungi, i.e, _Fusarium oxysporum_[55, 56], one of the isolated endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore, maintenance of _N. sphaerica_ and _P. betae_ as endophytes seems to be an ecological benefit to _S. sonchifolius_.\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n\\nThis study was funded by grants from the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) within the Biota-Bioprospecta-FAPESP - The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br), grant n\\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\) 04/07935-6, and the Brazilian Government's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).
