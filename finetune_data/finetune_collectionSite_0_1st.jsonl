AbstractÐIn addition to the known diterpene casearin G (1), two new clerodane diterpene casearins type, casearin S (2) and casearin T (3), were isolated from an acetylated bioactive CH2Cl2/MeOH extract from leaves of Casearia sylvestris. The diterpenes 1±3 exhibited moderate but selective activity towards the DNA-repair de®cient yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants RAD 52YK and RS 321.

All rights reserved INTRODUCTION As a part of our ongoing search for natural pro- duct-based anticancer agents from Brazilian plant species [1±3], we have screened the CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1, v/v) extract obtained from the leaves of Casearia sylvestris SW (Flacourtiaceae). The genus Casearia, with about 1000 described species [4], has not been subjected to extensive investigations [5±9]. C. sylvestris is reported to be a source of casearins, diterpenes known to have cytotoxic activity against V-79 cells [9±11]. Bioactivity-directed fractionation of an extract of leaves of C. sylvestris, collected in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, led to the isolation of the known clerodane diterpene, casearin G (1), and the two new clerodane diterpenes, casearin S (2) and T (3), as the main components responsible for the DNA-damaging activity of this extract. This is the ®rst report of the DNA-modifying activity of clero- dane diterpenes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A preliminary investigation of the bioactive CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of C. syl- vestris indicated that its bioactivity was due to diterpene components. The resulting fractions exhi- biting bioactivity were further separated by silica gel CC and prep. TLC to aord ®ve bioactive frac- tions containing oxygenated diterpenes as their main constituents. A small amount of each fraction was acetylated in order to improve the process of puri®cation and also to assure that the acetylated products maintained their bioactivities. As the acetylated fractions remained active, the non-acetyl- ated mixtures were subjected to acetylation followed by the usual puri®cation to yield three acetylated bioactive clerodane diterpenes, named casearins G, S and T. Casearin G (1) is a known compound pre- viously isolated from the same source [11], while casearins S (2) and T (3) are new bioactive diter- penes. Their structures were con®rmed by extensive spectroscopic studies and comparison of their spec- tra with those in the literature for related casearins [8±11]. Casearin S (2), C27H38O7 (EIMS), [a]D +18.08, exhibited 1H and 13C NMR spectral data very simi- lar to those observed for casearin G [11] (Tables 1 and 2).

The other signals attributed to H-2, H-7, H-12, H-14, H-15 and H-19 were almost superimposable, when compared with 1, indicating that the only modi®- cation in the structure of 2 was related to C-18. In fact, the 13C NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 2) re- sembled that of casearin G, with the major dier- ences being due to the lack of the signal at d 94.5 (d) attributed to C-18, and the presence of an ad- ditional signal at d 172.6 (s), typical of a lactone carbonyl function. Analysis of the 1H NMR spec- tral data showed that the signal of H-3 resonates at d 6.79 (br s), while this proton in compound 1 res- onates at d 5.99 (br s). The only explanation of this chemical shift dierence (Dd 0.81) observed for H-3 must be that the hemiacetal function at C-18 in 1 is converted to a carbonyl group in 2. The presence of only one acetyl and one butanoyl group in 2 was also con®rmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2). The locations of the acetyl moi- eties were de®ned by 1H-13C long-range COLOC spectra. The hydrogen linked to the C-19 methine showed a correlation with the C-18 carbonyl carbon of the lactone ring (d 172.6). The modi®cation of the chemical shift values in the 13C NMR spectrum of C-3 and C-4 (d 132.4 and 142.0, respectively) corroborated the assignment of the carbonyl func- tion to C-18 [12]. As the position and con®guration of the methoxy group of the casearin analogue compounds were determined in C-2 by INADEQUATE spectra [10] and X-ray analysis [10], the butanoyl group was de®ned as linked to C-7, although no correlation was observed in long-range spectra between H-7 and the carbonyl of the buta- noyl group. The equatorial orientation of the buta- noyl function at C-7 was inferred by considering the coupling constants observed for H-7 in 2 and comparison with those of casearin G. The relative con®guration of the stereogenic carbon C-2 in 2 was assigned on the basis of 1H-1H COSY spectra and comparison of these data with those reported for casearin analogues [11].

R. F. DE CARVALHO et al. 1660 Caserarin T (3) was obtained as a colorless oil after acetylation. This diterpene also showed 1H and 13C NMR spectral characteristics similar to other casearins [8±12]. Compound 3 has a marked structural resemblance to casearins B, P and Q, due the presence of a acetyl group at C-6 [8, 10]. The spectral data (Tables 1 and 2) obtained for 3 were consistent with the structural features of casearins, usually characterized by methoxy, acetoxy and butanoyloxy moieties. In the case of 3, the 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) were compatible with the structure proposed for this diterpene. One meth- oxy function at C-2, three acetoxy groups at C-18, C-19, C-6, and one butanoyloxy group at C-7 were assigned by analysis of 1H-13C long-range COLOC correlations. Again, the correlation between H-7 and the carbonyl of the butanoyl group was not observed. However, correlations of H-6, H-18 and H-19 with carbonyl groups at d 170.2, 170.4 and 170.0 respectively, attributed to acetoxy functions linked to the corresponding carbons, provided clear evidence for the location of these groups and conse- quently for the structure of 3. Further, the proton signal of H-6 (d 5.37) in 3 was coupled with H-7 (d 5.17) by 4.7 Hz, completely dierent for C-6 (d 5.19, J = 10.6 Hz) in casearins B and Q [10, 11]. Since the acetoxy groups in these latter compounds are in equatorial positions, the acetoxyl function in 3 must be b and axial. Further evidence for the b- disposition of the functional group at C-6 in 3 was provided by the chemical shift value of C-8 at d 37.1, shielded by 2 ppm in relation to casearins B and Q [9, 10]. The biological activity data for diterpenes 1±3 in the mechanism-based yeast mutant bioassay are given in Table 3. All three diterpenoid compounds showed selective activity in the Rad 52Y and RS 321 assay compared with the wild type Rad+ strain [13]. EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck, 230±400 and 70±230 Mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated, and solvents were redistilled prior to use. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer at 200 MHz with TMS as in- ternal standard. 13C NMR and 2D NMR were per- formed at 50 MHz with TMS as internal standard. Mass spectra were taken on a Platform II spec- trometer. Optical activities were measured on a Carl Zeiss Jena Polamat A. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. Plant material The aerial parts of Casearia sylvestris SW (Flacourtiaceae) were collected at the Florestal Reserve at Martinho Prado (SaÄ o Paulo State, Brazil) in October 1994. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, SaÄ o Paulo, Brazil. Bioassay Identical to those reported in Ref. [13]. Extraction and isolation of constituents The dried and powdered leaves of C. sylvestris (3.5 kg) were sequentially extracted with cold n-hex- ane and a mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1, v/v). The latter extract (13.5 g) was subjected to gel ®ltration with elution by n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The bioactive CH2Cl2 fraction was concen- trated in vacuo to aord a brown gum (1.2 g), Table 2. 13C NMR spectral data for casearins G (1), S (2) and T (3)a,b (CDCl3, 50 MHz) C 1[lit.10] 2 3 1 24.6 25.2 25.8 2 72.7 72.6 72.2 3 122.7 132.4 125.4 4 144.2 142.0 141.2 5 49.7 46.0 52.5 6 34.2 36.1 72.40 7 71.4 73.9 73.6 8 41.0 41.9 37.1 9 39.5 40.0 39.2 10 33.9 36.1 36.5 11 30.3 30.6 29.7 12 125.9 125.5 125.7 13 133.8 133.3 133.2 14 133.4 132.9 133.1 15 114.4 116.0 114.6 16 20.2 20.2 20.5 17 10.7 11.0 11.0 18 94.5 172.6 94.6 19 99.1 97.6 97.6 20 25.7 25.4 25.6 OMe 56.9 56.5 57.0 Acetate 21.2 21.1 21.4 169.2 170.3 170.2 20.9 Ð 21.9 170.4 Ð 170.4 Ð Ð 21.0 Ð Ð 170.0 Butylate 13.7 13.7 13.4 18.5 18.4 18.9 36.4 36.0 36.0 172.7 172.9 172.0 amultiplicities determined by DEPT experiments. bAssignments based on HETCOR and COLOC experiments.

A chemical study on the EtOAc extract produced by Xylaria sp., an endophytic fungus from Piper aduncum, resulted in the isolation of a new cytochalasin 1, along with five known 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5), and R (6). The 1-6 were evaluated against the fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum and only 5 showed weak activity. The cytotoxicity in vitro against HeLA and CHO cells lines were investigated and the cytochalasins 2-4, and 6 showed a strong activity against HeLA. The DNAdamaging activity of 1-6 were also investigated against mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. Keywords: Xylaria sp.; Piper aduncum; endophytic fungus. INTRODUÇÃO Aproximadamente um quarto de todos os produtos naturais biologicamente ativos conhecidos têm sido produzidos por fun gos.1 Estes são estimados em 1,5 milhões de espécies2 distribuídos principalmente entre fungos micoparasitas, coprófilos, de solo, de água doce, epifíticos e endofíticos. Fungos endofíticos são micro- organismos que habitam o interior de um vegetal,3 em pelo menos por um período de seu ciclo de vida. Apesar de serem produtores de metabólitos secundários biologicamente ativos,4 são pouco explorados. Dando continuidade aos estudos de prospecção química e bioló gica em fungos endofíticos isolados de espécies vegetais do cerrado, a espécie vegetal Piper aduncum foi selecionada, pois a medicina popular relata propriedades diurética, cicatrizante e anti-hemorrá gica.5-7 Dados fitoquímicos de P. aduncum relatam a ocorrência de amidas, fenilpropanoides, di-hidrochalconas e derivados prenilados com atividades moluscida, bactericida e citotóxica.8,9 Estes fatos, associados às observações de que micro-organismos endofíticos podem mimetizar a química de seus respectivos hospedeiros e produzirem substâncias ou derivados com maior bioatividade,10 direcionaram o estudo químico/biológico dos fungos endofíticos associados à P. aduncum. P. aduncum foi submetida ao isolamento e à purificação dos endófitos e conduziu a seis linhagens puras. Após triagem quími ca/biológica, a linhagem PA-01 foi classificada como Xylaria sp. e selecionada para estudo, mediante atividade seletiva do extrato bruto AcOEt contra a linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevi siae RS 321 e contra os fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. O fungo Xylaria sp. foi cultivado no meio de cultura PDB, em escala ampliada, para obtenção do extrato bruto que, após fracio namento cromatográfico por CLAE, levou ao isolamento de uma citocalasina inédita (1) e das 19,20-epoxicitocalasina conhecidas D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5) e (6). A estrutura das substâncias isoladas foi determinada com base nas análises dos dados espectrométricos de IV, EM-ES, RMN de 1H e 13C (1D e 2 D). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A fórmula molecular da citocalasina 1 foi estabelecida como C30H37NO7 por ESI-EMAR (m/z 524,2729 [M + H]+) e com auxílio dos espectros de RMN de 13C e DEPT. O espectro no IV mostrou as absorções de hidroxila (3440 cm-1) e uma absorção larga (1710 cm-1) atribuída a estiramentos C=O. A análise dos dados de RMN de 1H, 13C e DEPT indicou a presença de quatro átomos de carbono carbonílico (sendo dois de grupos cetona), um anel benzênico mo nossubstituído, cinco metilas, onze átomos de carbono de grupos metínicos (dois olefínicos e três carbinólicos), dois metilênicos e dois átomos de carbono quaternário, sendo um carbinólico. O índice de deficiência de hidrogênio calculado foi igual a 13. Estes dados são característicos de substâncias da classe das citocalasinas. A atribuição de todos os átomos de hidrogênio aos respectivos átomos de carbonos foi realizada com auxílio dos mapas de contorno do experimento gHMQC. A análise dos espectros de gCOSY e TOCSY indicou os átomos de hidrogênios acoplados em série e permitiu identificar os quatro sistemas de spins da molécula H-2’ a H-6’; H-10 a H-12; H-8 a H-22 e H-19 a H-21. A estereoquímica da ligação dupla entre C-13 e C-14, assim como o epóxido em C-19 e C-20 foi definida como trans pelas constantes de acoplamento (J = 15,5 e 2,0 Hz, respectivamente).11 A correlação gHM BC de H-10a (dH 2,68) com C-1´ (dC 137,5) confirmou a presença do grupo fenil em C-10. As correlações de H-12 (dH 1,01) e H-8 (dH 3,42) Citocalasinas produzidas por Xylaria sp. 2039 Vol. 33, No. 10 com C-7 (dC 212,6) e comparação com dados de citocalasa-13(E),19(E)- dieno-1,7,17-triona,12 possibilitaram a elucidação do núcleo isoindolona. As correlações de H-22 (dH 1,12) e H-23 (dH 1,44) com C-17 (δC 214,9) e entre H-21 (dH 5,43) e C-8 (dC 51,2) e comparação com 19,20-epoxi citocalasina C (3)13 permitiram elucidar o anel macrocíclico. As configurações relativas do núcleo isoindolona e do anel macrocíclico de 1 foram estabelecidas pelo experimento NOESY, onde se observou correlação entre H-4 e H-21, valores dos desloca mentos químicos de RMN de 1H e 13C, constantes de acoplamento e comparação com 18,21-di-hidroxi-16,18-dimetil-10-fenil-citocalasa- 13(E),19(E)-dieno-1,7,17-triona12 e com 19,20-epoxicitocalasina C (3),13 respectivamente, Figura 1. Estas informações permitiram estabelecer a configuração relativa da inédita citocalasina 1. As substâncias 2-6 foram identificadas pela análise por EM, RMN de 1H e 13C, gHMQC, gHMBC, gCOSY e NOESY e por comparação com dados descritos na literatura.13 As citocalasinas 1-6 (Figura 1) foram avaliadas quanto à atividade antifúngica, frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium clados porioides e C. sphaerospermum, usando-se o método da autobiografia direta.14 A substância 5 mostrou uma fraca atividade na concentração de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrão nistatina (1mg mL- 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentaram-se inativas. As substâncias 1-6 foram ensaiadas frente à linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevisiae RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica não serem as responsáveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15 A avaliação da atividade citotóxica de 1-6 foi realizada em células de mamíferos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cérvix humano) e CHO (ovário de hamster chinês).16 Para a linhagem não cancerígena CHO, as substâncias 2, 3, 5 e 6 apresentaram IC50 de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As citocalasinas 1 e 4 não apresen taram IC50 nas concentrações testadas, sendo que 1 foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1. Na linhagem cancerígena HeLa as substâncias 1-6 apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 5,0 mmol L-1. A forte atividade apresentada pelas citocalasinas 2-5 contra a linhagem cancerígena HeLa e a fraca contra a linhagem não cance rígena CHO evidenciam uma seletividade destas substâncias para as linhagens tumorais HeLa. Para o nosso conhecimento, este é o primeiro relato de citocalasinas sendo produzidas por fungos endofíticos associados à Piper aduncum. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentação Os espectros de absorção na região do IV foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa resolução da marca Fisons, modelo VG Pla tfform II, no modo de ionização electrospray (ESI). Os espectros Figura 1. Estruturas das substâncias isoladas de Xylaria sp. Silva et al. 2040 Quim. Nova de massas de alta resolução foram obtidos em espectrômetro QTOF (Micromass), utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em CDCl3 e DMSO-d6, no espectrômetro Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrão de referência. O aparelho de cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE) foi um Varian Pro Star, com detectores UV-Vis. As colunas analíticas e preparativas utilizadas foram Phenomenex tipo Luna - C18 (250 x 4,60 mm, 5 mm) e (250 x 21,20 mm, 10 mm), respectivamente. Os meios de cultura líquido e sólido foram submetidos à esterili zação em autoclave a 121 °C e 1 atm de pressão por 20 min. Material vegetal Folhas saudáveis de Piper aduncum foram coletadas na Casa de Vegetação do Instituto de Química - UNESP- Araraquara em maio de 2001. Isolamento dos fungos endofíticos As folhas coletadas foram lavadas com água e sabão, a seguir esterilizadas por imersão em NaClO (1%) por 5 min, seguido de etanol 70% por 1 min e lavadas com água esterilizada 2 vezes por 10 min.17-22 As folhas esterilizadas foram assepticamente seccionadas em segmentos de 1 cm2 aproximadamente e colocados em placa de Petri, contendo o meio de cultura batata dextrose ágar (PDA), marca Difco, preparado na concentração de 39 g/L, acrescido do antibiótico sulfato de gentamicina e incubado a 25 oC. O crescimento dos fungos foi monitorado diariamente e, após cada cultura atingir de 1-2 cm em diâmetro, foram submetidos a sucessivas repicagens até obtenção das linhagens puras. Foram obtidas seis linhagens puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Química Orgânica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como Xylaria sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Coleção Micológica de Lavras, Universi dade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292. Cultivo em meio líquido e obtenção dos extratos brutos O fungo endofítico Xylaria sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 dias. A seguir foi inoculado em 20 frascos de Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentração de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantidos em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 °C por 28 dias. Após este período o caldo foi separado do micélio por filtração, extraído com AcOEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extraído com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fração CHCl3 (0,7 g). Isolamento das citocalasinas A fração CHCl3 (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de sílica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco frações: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1). Estas foram analisadas por CLAE-DAD (Si C-18, gradiente H2O:CH3CN 5 a 100% de CH3CN, 40 min, fluxo de 1 mL/min), sendo detectada uma alta concentração de citocalasinas na fração PA-01-3. A fração PA-01-3 foi submetida à CLAE-prep em fase reversa [l = 220 nm, 10 mL/min CH3CN:H2O (68:32)], resultando nas cito calasinas 1 (5,5 mg, tR = 71 min), 2 (17,5 mg, tR = 32 min), 3 (30,0 mg, tR = 54 min), 4 (15,0 mg, tR = 26 min), 5 (15,5 mg, tR = 74 min), e 6 (12,5 mg, tR = 43 min). Bioensaios Teste de bioautografia com fungos Para avaliação da atividade antifúngica do extrato bruto AcOEt e das substâncias 1-6 frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioi des e C. sphaerospermum, utilizou-se a metodologia descrita anterior mente na literatura.14 Os ensaios foram realizados nas concentrações de 5, 10, 20, 50 e 100 µg mL-1, usando nistatina como controle positivo. Teste para avaliação preliminar da atividade citotóxica Para a avaliação da atividade citotóxica do extrato bruto AcOEt e das substâncias 1-6, foram utilizadas três linhagens mutantes de Sac charomyces cerevisiae (rad+, 52Y e RS 321), segundo metodologia descrita na literatura.15 Os extratos foram testados na concentração de 2 mg mL-1 e as substâncias puras com 0,5 mg mL-1, como padrões foram utilizados: camptotecina: rad+ 200 µg mL-1 (16,0 mm; 16,0 mm) e 52Y (5 µg mL-1; 21,0 mm) e estreptonigrina: RS-321 (4 µg mL-1 20,0 mm).

Additionally, 19 known compounds such as benzoic acids, chromenes, and flavonoids were isolated and identified. The antifungal activity of these compounds was evaluated by bioautographic TLC assay against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. Piperaceae species have been extensively investigated as a source of new natural products with potential anti- tumoral, antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal activi- ties.1-3 The phytochemical profile in Piper species is characterized by the production of typical classes of com- pounds such as amides, benzoic acids, and chromenes in addition to lignans, neolignans, and a few alkaloids.4-6 As part of our research aiming to uncover new antifungal compounds in Brazilian Piperaceae species, we have previ- ously reported the occurrence of pyrrolidine amides in P. hispidum7 and piperidine, isobutyl, and pyrrolidine amides in P. tuberculatum8 and P. arboreum.9 Additionally, anti- fungal prenylated hydroquinones and flavanones from leaves of P. crassinervium10 have been described as well. The search for new antifungal compounds will contribute to establish a model for further investments in this field in order to preserve, to study, and to exploit rationally the remaining flora of Sa˜o Paulo State. In the course of the Biota Program (http://www.biota.sp), a large number of Piper species collected in the state of Sa˜o Paulo had their extracts assayed by means of bioau- tography using Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig). Since the extracts of Piper crassinervium Kunth, P. aduncum L., P. hostman- nianum (Miquel) C. DC., and P. gaudichaudianum Kunth showed high growth inhibitory activity, they were subjected to dereplication procedures using chromatographic tech- niques associated with the bioautographic assay. Thus, the major aim of this paper is to describe the isolation and structural determination of the new antifungal compounds from Piperaceae species. Results and Discussion The MeOH extract from leaves of P. crassinervium yielded three prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acids [4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzo- ic acid (crassinervic acid, 1), 4-hydroxy-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′- oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (2), and 4-hydroxy- (3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-Z-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (3)], 3,4,5-trimethoxydihydrocinnamic acid12 (4), 1,4-dihydroxy- 2-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzene10 (5), and two flavanones [5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavanone13 (nar- ingenin 4′-methyl ether, 6) and 5,4′-dihydroxy-7-methoxy- flavanone14 (sakuranetin, 7)]. The CH2Cl2- and hexane-soluble parts of the MeOH extract of the leaves of P. aduncum yielded one new prenylated benzoic acid [methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3′-methyl- 1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate (aduncumene, 8)], four known chromenes [methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3′-methyl-2′-butenyl)- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (9), methyl 2,2-dimeth- yl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), methyl 8-hydroxy- 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (11), and 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid15,16 (12)], 4-methoxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), and two dihydrochalcones [2′,6′-dihydroxy-4′-meth- oxydihydrochalcone15 (14) and piperaduncine B17 (15)]. The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of P. hostmannianum yielded methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-ben- zopyran-6-carboxylate16 (10), three prenylated methyl hy- droxybenzoate derivatives [methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-butenyl)benzoate18,19 (16), methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-hydroxy-3′-butenyl)benzoate16 (17), and the new derivative methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate (hostmaniene, 18)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves and roots of P. gaudichaudianum yielded two chromenes [2-methyl- 2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2H-1- benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (gaudichaudianic acid, 20) and methyl 2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylate22 (21)], three prenylated benzoic acids [4-methoxy-3- (3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), 4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid23 (22), and methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)ben- zoate24 (methyl taboganate, 23)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). Compound 1 was isolated from the leaves of P. crassin- ervium as a white amorphous solid. Its molecular formula was established as C17H22O5 by analysis of its HREIMS spectrum (m/z 306.1459, calcd 306.1467). The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3380 cm-1), two carbonyl groups (1696, 1611 cm-1), and an aromatic ring (1489, 1421 cm-1).

Additional signals included three methyl singlets (δ 1.37, 1.50, 1.58), two doublets at δ 2.77 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz) and 2.64 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz), characteristic of an isolated R-carbonyl methylene group, and a triplet at δ 4.98 (1H, J ) 7.2 Hz), indicating the presence of a double bond in the side chain. The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) showed signals for 17 carbon atoms assigned as two carbonyl (δ 191.5, 170.6), six aromatic (δ 163.7, 137.3, 129.9, 122.1, 119.9, 118.8), two olefinic (δ 132.5, 122.9), three methyl (δ 25.6, 23.9, 17.5), one tertiary carbinolic (δ 82.3), and three aliphatic meth- ylenic carbons (δ 47.2, 39.3, 22.2). The assignments of the signals for aromatic carbons were based on comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data reported for known benzoic acids analogues.11 The connectivity between aromatic and aliphatic moieties was revealed by analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The correlations between signals at δ 8.56 (H-2)/2.77 (H-2′a)/2.64 (H-2′b) with 191.5 (C-1′) as well as between δ 8.56 (H-2)/8.11 (H-6) with 170.6 (CO2H) (Figure 1) indicated that compound 1 contains one carbonyl group at C-1′ and one carboxyl group attached to C-1. The double bond at the side chain was assigned on the basis of the observed cross-peaks between δ 4.98 (H-6′) and 25.6 (C-8′)/17.5 (C-9′) in the HMBC spectrum and between signals at δ 4.98 (H-6′), 2.03 (H-5′), 1.58 (H-8′), and 1.50 (H-9′) in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Thus, the hydroxyl group on a tertiary carbon atom was placed at C-3′ of the side chain, in agreement with the HMBC correlations observed between the hydrogen signals at δ 2.77 (H-2′a)/ 2.64 (H-2′b), 1.70 (H-4′), and 1.37 (H-10′) with the carbon signal at δ 82.3 (C-3′). Analysis of the DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMBC NMR spectra allowed full assignment for all hydrogen and carbon atoms, and thus, the structure of crassinervic acid (1) was elucidated as 4-hydroxy-3-(3′,7′- dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzoic acid. Compound 8 was isolated from the leaves of P. aduncum as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula C14H16O4 was determined by LRESIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 1700, 1610, and at 1445 cm-1, assignable to two carbonyl groups and aromatic double bonds, respectively. The structure of the prenylated benzoic acid derivative was recognized by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum, which showed signals at δ 8.18 (1H, d, J ) 1.9 Hz), 8.06 (1H, dd, J ) 8.5 and 1.9 Hz), and 6.93 (1H, d, J ) 8.5 Hz). This spectrum also showed a set of signals including two methyl groups at δ 1.96 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz)/2.20 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz) and a multiplet at 6.53 (1H), which are characteristics of an isoprene unit, and additionally, two methoxyl groups at δ 3.90 (3H, s) and 3.86 (3H, s). The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) exhibited, in the low-field region, one carbomethoxyl group at δ 166.6, six aromatic carbons at δ 161.2, 134.1, 132.0, 131.2, 122.9, 111.4, and two signals corresponding to the double-bond carbons at δ 125.1 (CH) and 156.7 (C). These two signals, associated with the carbonyl signal at δ 192.7, indicated an R,â-unsaturated carbonyl system.22,25,26 The high-field region exhibited signals assignable to two methyl groups at δ 28.3 and 21.6 and two methoxyl groups at δ 52.5 and 56.2. The assign- ment of all signals observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 8 was corroborated by HMQC and HMBC experiments (Figure 1). The HMBC spectrum showed the correlation of the signal at δ 192.2 (C-1′) with the hydrogens at δ 8.18 (H-6), 8.06 (H-4), and 6.53 (H-2′) and between δ 166.6 (C-6′) and 8.18 (H-6) and also with 3.86 (OCH3). Finally, the cross-peaks observed between δ 156.7 (C-3′) and 2.20 (H-4′) and 1.96 (H-5′) confirmed the structure of 8 as methyl 2-methoxyl-5-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate, named aduncumene. Compound 18 was obtained from the leaves of P. host- mannianum, as a white amorphous powder. Its LRESIMS data associated with 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) and elemental analysis indicated a molecular formula of C13H18O5. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3463 cm-1), an aromatic ring (1613, 1440 cm-1), and a carbonyl group (1715 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals assignable to three coupled aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.76 (d, J ) 9.0 Hz), 7.72 (dd, J ) 9.0 and 2.0 Hz), and 7.77 (d, J ) 2.0 Hz), characteristic of the 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. In addition, this spectrum displayed three singlets at δ 1.27 (3H), 1.30 (3H), and 3.80 (3H) assigned, respectively, to two methyl groups attached to an oxygen-bearing carbon and to one methoxyl group. The presence of an oxymethine hydrogen at δ 3.77 (dd, J ) 6.0 and 4.5 Hz), associated with the signals at δ 3.02 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 4.5 Hz) and 2.73 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 6.0 Hz), suggested a hydroxylated isoprene side chain at C-3 of the benzoic acid nucleus. The HMBC spectrum of 18 (Figure 1) showed correlation between the signals at δ 31.1 (C-1′) and 7.77 (H-2), between δ 69.2 (C-2′) and 1.27 (H-4′)/1.30 (H-5′)/3.02 (H-1′a)/2.73 1784 Journal of Natural Products, 2004, Vol. 67, No. 11 Lago et al. (H-1′b), between δ 25.0 (C-4′) and 1.30 (H-5′), and between δ 22.0 (C-5′) and 3.77 (H-2′)/1.27 (H-4′), confirming the positioning of the vicinal hydroxyl groups at C-2′ and C-3′. The methoxyl group was determined as a methyl ester, considering that a cross-peak between the signals at δ 166.9 (C-6′) and 3.80 (OCH3) was observed in the HMBC spectrum. Therefore, the structure of 18 was determined as methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate, named hostmaniane. Compound 20 was isolated from the leaves of P. gaud- ichaudianum as an amorphous solid. The molecular for- mula C22H28O3 was deduced by LREIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3500, 1681, and 1601 cm-1 assignable to a hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic ring, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at δ 5.58 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and 6.38 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and four singlets at δ 1.41 (3H, s), 1.67 (3H, s), 1.56 (3H, s), and 1.73 (6H, s), which were associated with the chromene/isoprene moi- eties.15,27 Two low-field doublets at δ 7.59 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz) and 7.75 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz), assignable to the meta aromatic hydrogens, indicated a 3,4,5-trisubstituted benzoic acid derivative, which was corroborated by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. A carboxyl group, with a signal at δ 172.1, was placed between the two aromatic hydrogens (C-6). The chromene moiety was confirmed by the presence of signals at δ 79.9, 129.5, and 121.9 assignable to the carbons C-2, C-3, and C-4, respectively.27 The DEPT 135° spectrum confirmed these previous assignments and showed the presence of three methylenes at δ 41.9 (C-1′), 22.7 (C-2′), and 28.2 (C-1′′), which were associated with the respective protons at δ 1.78 (H-1′), 2.25 (H-2′), and 3.28 (H-1′′) by means of the HMQC spectrum. The linkage positions of the two isoprene side chains to the chromene/aromatic ring were determined by an HMBC experiment (Figure 1), in which correlations between the signals at δ 128.9 (C-8) and 5.28 (H-2′′), between δ 131.8 (C-7) and 3.28 (H-1′′), between δ 41.9 (C-1′) and 1.41 (H-9), and between δ 123.9 (C-3′) and 1.78 (H-1′) were observed. Thus, the complete assign- ments of NMR data of 20 were made by analysis of HMQC and HMBC data and by comparison with those obtained for similar compounds isolated from P. lhotzkyanum and P. aduncum.11,28 Therefore, the structure of 20 was deter- mined as 2-methyl-2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl- 2′′-butenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid, named gaud- ichaudianic acid. The optical rotation, [R]25D +21 (c 0.1, CHCl3), was similar to that observed for sargatriol,29 but this compound has two additional chiral carbons (C5′ and C6′) in its side chain and is not appropriate for a direct comparison. Nevertheless, the CD curve obtained for 20 was fully opposite to that described for sargatriol including the positive Cotton effect at 260-280 nm (styrene chro- mophore). Thus, despite the differences in the substitution pattern in the aromatic ring for 20, the S configuration at C-2 was suggested. The antifungal activities of compounds 1-23 isolated from these four Piper species were evaluated against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum7 (Table 1). The fungitoxic potential for the compounds 5, 6, 7, 17, 19, and 21 has been previously reported.10,22,26,27 As can be seen, the chromene 9, crassinervic acid (1), and hostmaniane (18) showed high potential as antifungal compounds and should be further evaluated against other fungi. Several com- pounds, 2, 3, 5, 7, 16, and 19, showed potency (1.0 µg) similar to that of the control. In the prenylated benzoic acid series (1-3) the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the side chain, as in the case of 1, doubled the activity, while the changes in the double-bond configuration (2 and 3) did not cause significant improvement. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeter (Na filter, λ ) 588 nm) and CD spectrum in CHCl3 with a JASCO ORD/UV-6 spectropolarimeter.

The resulting extract (28.3 g) was dissolved in CHCl3 (100 mL) and partitioned with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (3 × 50 mL). The NaHCO3 solution was neutralized with HCl (6 M), extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated, yielding 764 mg of residue.

The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays, C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491, have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. For the antifungal assay 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 100.0 µg of crude extracts or semipurified fractions were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates, developed with hex- ane-EtOAc (7:3), and dried for complete removal of solvents. For the pure compound 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 50.0, 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 µg were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. cladosporioides or C. sphaerospermum in glucose and salt solution and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C, following the previously reported procedure.10,30,31 Fungal growth inhibition appeared as clear zones against a dark background, indicating the minimum amount of compounds 1-25 required for it (Table 1). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls, whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls. Acknowledgment.

The fungus led to the formation of a different product through an unusual epoxidation reaction between C4 and C5, formation of a C3,C10 ether bridge, and a methoxylation of the C1 of tagitinin C. The chemical structure of the product, namely 1b-methoxy-3a-hydroxy- 3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobutyroyloxygermacr-11(13)-en- 6a,12-olide, is the same as that of a derivative that was recently isolated from the ﬂowers of a Brazilian population of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia), which is the source of the substrate tagitinin C. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the substrate and the biotransformed product were evaluated in HL-60 cells using an MTT assay, and both compounds were found to be cytotoxic. We show that soil fungi may be useful in the biotransformation of ses- quiterpene lactones, thereby leading to unusual changes in their chemical structures that may preserve or alter their biological activities, and may also mimic plant biosynthetic pathways for production of secondary metabolites.

They are considered chemical markers within the family and have ecological as well as economic value [10, 37]. Moreover, STLs exhibit an array of interesting biological activities such as antimicrobial [5], cytostatic [25], and antifeedant activities [30]. They are the main active con- stituents of many medicinal plants of Asteraceae world- wide [32]. Tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) is an important STL occurring in the glandular trichomes of the leaves and inﬂorescences of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia Hemsl. A. Gray, Asteraceae) [2]. It shows cytotoxic [19], anti-inﬂammatory [33], and antifeedant activities [2], and thus is a promising compound for further research into its mechanisms of action in different targets. T. diversifolia, the source of 1, is used in folk medicine in many countries [8, 14] and has B. A. Rocha M. T. Pupo S. Said F. B.

How- ever, there remains concern regarding the ingestion of STLs because of their toxicity [35]. An interesting approach is to obtain STL derivatives that may have lower toxic effects or improved pharmacological activities, or both. Obtaining STL analogues, however, based on classic synthetic methods is not always a straightforward proce- dure, so the biotransformation of biologically active STLs is an attractive alternative providing new derivatives whose effects should be investigated [20]. The biotransformation of organic compounds by microorganisms is considered an economically and eco- logically viable technology. In addition, it is a useful tool for the structural modiﬁcation of bioactive natural products and the study of natural product metabolism [15, 16]. Moreover, some microorganisms can transform drugs in a similar way to mammals, and the utilization of microbial systems as models which mimic the metabolism of drugs in humans has received considerable attention [7, 16]. Fungal biotransformations of naturally occurring STLs have been carried out to obtain modiﬁcations that enhance activity and/or decrease toxicity [21, 24], develop structure– activity relationships [1, 4], and establish in vitro models to predict mammalian metabolites [3, 39]. A considerable number of biotransformations of STLs have been described using fungi [29]. Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16888), for example, transformed costunolide into four main products, 1b-hydroxyarbusculin, colartin, 11,13-dihydrosantamarine, and 11,13-dihydroreynosin [20]. In the same study, A. och- raceous (CECT 2069) transformed deoxyvulgarin into two products, vulgarin and dihydrodouglanin [20]. The microbial transformation of sclareolide by A. niger (ATCC 10549) yielded four oxidized metabolites identiﬁed as 1b-hydrox- ysclareolide, 3b-hydroxysclareolide, 1a,3b-dihydroxyscla- reolide, and 1b,3b-dihydroxysclareolide [31]. The STL artemisitene was metabolized by A. niger (NRRL 599) to yield 11-epi-artemisinin, 9b-hydroxydeoxy-11-epi-arte- misinin, and 9b-hydroxy-11-epi-artemisinin [27]. Microbial transformation of the germacranolide parthenolide using A. niger (NRRL 599) and A. ochraceous (NRRL 2295) yiel- ded 11bH-dihydroparthenolide [11]. A. terreus (IFO6123) transformed dehydrocostuslactone into two derivatives, 11a,13-dihydrodehydrocostuslactone and 16-(1-methyl-1- propenyl)eremantholide [13]. Cultures of two strains of A. niger (AS 3.1858 and VKM F-1119) transformed one of the most important STLs, artemisinin,into four hydroxylated products, 3b-hydrodeoxyartemisinin, 1a-hydroxyartemisi- nin, 5b-hydroxyartemisinin, and 7b-hydroxyartemisinin [28, 39]. According to the literature, the main enzymatic reactions of STLs that are able to be catalyzed by Aspergillus Fig. 1 Proposal of biotransformation of 1 into 2 by A. terreus MT 5.3 (adapted from Spring et al. [38]) 1720 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 species are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation. Thus, with the aims of obtaining new, potentially bio- active compounds, and giving insights into the new meta- bolic reactions of STLs, we carried out the biotransformation of tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) by the fungus Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3. Materials and methods Isolation of tagitinin C (1) Leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (400 g) were collected by B. A. Rocha, in May 2007, in Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil. The material was identiﬁed by F. B. Da Costa, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the SPFR Herbarium, Depart- ment of Biology, Ribeira˜o Preto, SP, University of Sa˜o Paulo, under the number FBC #126. Air-dried entire leaves were rinsed for a few seconds with dichloromethane, for dissolution of the glandular trichomes [2], thereby yielding 5 g of a yellow crude extract after ﬁltration with common ﬁlter paper and solvent evaporation under reduced pres- sure. The dry residue was re-suspended in MeOH/H2O (7:3, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane followed by dichloromethane. After solvent evaporation, the dichloro- methane layer was fractionated over silica gel 60H (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7736) by vacuum liquid chromatography [9] using increasing amounts of ethyl acetate in n-hexane, thereby yielding nine fractions of 250 ml each. The tagi- tinin C-rich fractions (3 and 4) (1.5 g, conﬁrmed by infrared spectroscopy, TLC, and reversed-phase HPLC analysis, as well as comparison with an authentic sample [2]) were puriﬁed by centrifugal chromatography (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7749; 4 mm thickness; n-hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 6:3:1 v/v as eluent; ﬂow rate 2 ml/min; UV lamp 254 nm). For ﬁnal puriﬁcation, preparative TLC was used (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730; 1 mm thickness; n-hexane/ethyl acetate/ chloroform 5:3:2 v/v, and 2 % acetic acid as eluent). The isolated compound (1, 200 mg) was analyzed by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to check its purity before the biotransformation procedure. The 1H NMR spectral data of compounds (1 and 2) were in accordance with those reported [2]. Biotransformation procedure and analysis Screening was performed on a small scale (30 ml of fer- mentation medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) to select efﬁcient conditions for the biotransformation of 1. The trials for screening procedures were performed as previ- ously described by Krishna-Kumari et al. [17]. A. terreus MT 5.3 was cultivated in malt extract medium and incu- bated at 30 C for 7 days to obtain spores. After that, the spores were harvested using a 2 % Tween 80 aqueous solution and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. The pre-fermentative medium was inoculated with 1 9 107 spores/ml and incubated with agitation (150 rpm) at 30 C for 48 h. The resulting mycelium was harvested, rinsed with sterilized H2O, and transferred to fresh Czapek med- ium (initial pH 6.0). The culture was then incubated under the same conditions for 10 days. After 24 h, 0.1 mg/ml of 1, which had been previously dissolved in dimethyl sulf- oxide (3 mg dissolved in 300 ll), was added to the culture medium. Control ﬂasks contained culture medium with the fungus but without 1, culture medium with the fungus and dimethyl sulfoxide and without 1, culture medium with 1 and without the fungus, or only the culture medium. A time course study was carried out as follows. One Erlenmeyer ﬂask was taken every 24 h; the product was extracted with dichloromethane, and then analyzed by TLC to check the degree of transformation of compound 1. TLC was carried out on silica gel GF254 (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730) plates (0.25 mm thickness, 20 9 20 cm), and the spots were visualized after spraying the plates with vanillin/sulfuric acid (1 % H2SO4 in ethanol). Thirty milligrams of 1 was used for the preparative- scale incubation with A. terreus MT 5.3 for 120 h, at 150 rpm, and 30 C. The culture broth was ﬁltered using ﬁlter paper and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting residue (45 mg) was subjected to separation by HPLC in a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp liquid chromatograph with an SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector (Japan) using a C-18 column (Shimadzu, Japan, ODS Shim-pack 5 lm, 4.6 9 250 mm; ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min; DAD detection). The main metabolite (2, 4 mg) was puriﬁed after repe- ated injections according to the following gradient: 0.1 min 20 % MeCN, 35 min 60 % MeCN, 38 min 100 % MeCN, 43 min 100 % MeCN, 48 min 20 % MeCN, and 53 min 20 % MeCN. Compounds 1 and 2 were observed at retention times of 24 and 29 min, respectively (UV detection set at 210 nm). Comparison of the HPLC proﬁles of the controls with those bio- transformed ensured that 1 had been converted to 2 through microbial catalysis. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by HR-ESIMS, 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques, and com- parison of the spectroscopic data with an authentic sample and published data [2]. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker (Germany) DPX 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H). Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Aldrich (USA). High-resolution mass J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 1721 123 spectra were recorded on a UltrOTOFq-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Microorganism Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3 was isolated from soil in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and identiﬁed by C. M. S. Motta from ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas–Micoteca URM–Depart- amento de Micologia/CCB-UFP’’, Av. Prof. Nelson Chaves s/no., Cidade Universita´ria, 50670-420, Recife, Brazil. The fungus was maintained by periodic transfers on PDA at 8 C. The microorganism A. terreus MT 5.3 was deposited in the collection ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas Tropicais’’ (Tropical Culture Collection) of Andre´ Tosello Foundation (www. fat.org.br), under accession number CCT-7640. Cytotoxicity assay Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, as described by Mossman [23]. The MTT (Sigma, USA) solution at a ﬁnal concentration of 500 lg/ml was added to the culture medium 4 h before the end of the treatment, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide to the cell culture. For cell treatment we used compounds 1 and 2, at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 lg/ml. Non- treated culture cells were used as a negative control, and cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. Statis- tical analysis was performed by Student’s t test; and Dunnett’s test was used for multiple comparisons. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁ- cant. Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Results and discussion The transformation of 1 by A. terreus MT 5.3 yielded the unusual STL 2 as the main compound. This was identiﬁed as 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobuty- royloxygermacr-11(13)-en-6a,12-olide. The 1H NMR spectral data of 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1. Although several researchers worldwide have chemically investi- gated T. diversifolia, compound 2 was isolated only from a Brazilian population [2]. As already mentioned, it should be emphasized that the main enzymatic reactions that Aspergillus promotes in STLs are hydrogenation, hydrox- ylation, reduction, and acetylation [6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 39, 40]. Interestingly, we have uncovered an unu- sual epoxidation between C4 and C5; a methoxy group was added at C1, and a C1,C10 ether bridge was formed in the 10-membered ring of 1. Nevertheless, the exocyclic double bond at C11–C13 was preserved. Compound 2 was recently isolated from a rinse extract of the inﬂorescences of Brazilian T. diversifolia [2]. Although its chemical structure is already known, this is the ﬁrst time that 2 has been obtained as a microbial biotransformation product. An interesting observation is that the Aspergillus strain used in our work was able to catalyze chemical reactions that mimicked those which occur inside the glandular trichomes from the inﬂorescences of T. diversifolia. Glandular tric- homes of Asteraceae species are the places where the biosynthesis of STLs usually occurs, and possibly where 1 is converted to 2. Thus, this fungus can be used as an alternative means of gaining 2 from 1, therefore conﬁrming the potential of biotransformation of natural compounds by microorganisms, as well as their ability to mimic plant biosynthetic pathways [34]. Spring et al. [38] reported the isolation of a closely related analogue of 1 from Viguiera quinqueremis (Aster- aceae), and proposed its conversion to the hemiketal form, such as 1b depicted in Fig. 1. The structural differences between the previously reported analogue and 1 are the nature of the C8 side-chain ester (methylbutyrate instead of isobutyrate) and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C15. The authors also discussed a spontaneous methoxylation of the 1a analogue at C1 in the presence of MeOH, thereby leading to the formation of an analogue of 1b (Fig. 1) [38]. Thus, it could be argued in our work that 2 is a compound produced by A. terreus starting from 1b, an artifact that had Table 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1 and 2 (500 MHz, CDCl3, J in Hz) H 1 2 1 6.93 d (16.9) 3.99 dd (6.7, 10.4) 2a 6.26 d (16.9) 2.57 dd (6.7, 12.5) 2b – 1,93 dd (10.7, 12.6) 5 5.88 d (9.0) 3.33 s 6 5.41 d (9.0) 5.13 dd (4.65) 7 3.55 m 4.33 dddd 8 5.33 ddd (3.2, 6.0, 10.0) 5.53 ddd (4.2; 7.1, 11.0) 9a 2.40 dd (6.0, 13.8) 1.74 dd (11.1, 14.7) 9b 2.00 dd (10.0, 13.8) 1.66 dd (4.8, 14.7) 13a 6.36 d (1.7) 6.29 dd (2.8) 13b 5.81 d (1.8) 5.62 dd (2.3) 14 1.53 s 1.50 s 15 1.95 s 1.44 s 20 2.44 sept 2.41 sept 30 1.06 d (7.1) 1.05 d (7.0) 40 1.03 d (7.1) 1.04 d (7.0) –OMe – 3.35 s 1722 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 originated from 1 in the presence of MeOH. Nevertheless, a spontaneous interconversion where 1 was converted to 1b would never occur in methods such as ours, because MeOH was not used in any step of the experimental procedure, either for isolation, analysis, or structure elucidation of 1. Compound 2 is therefore a natural product obtained by biotransformation of 1. In addition, the crude extract from the leaves of T. diversifolia used in this work had been screened for the presence of 2 by HPLC–DAD analysis, and it was not detected even as a trace. According to Barrero et al. [6], epoxidation and hydro- genation reactions of the exocyclic double bond at C11– C13 seem to be the most common processes in the microbial transformation of STLs by ﬁlamentous fungi. In order to explain the formation of the epoxide group between C4 and C5 in the biotransformed molecule 2 as well as the methoxylation of C1, we followed the proposal of Onken and Berger [26]. The authors state that terpenoids are preferentially dissolved in the cell membranes of fungi, thereby inducing changes in properties of the membrane and causing toxicity. Fungi react against these effects and co-metabolize compounds to others that are more water soluble, thus showing that the enzyme systems involved in this process of detoxiﬁcation are comparable to those of other eukaryotic cells. In the ﬁrst step, monooxygenases of cytochrome P450 catalyze the oxyfunctionalization of the molecules [12, 22]. Then, in the second step, more water- soluble products are formed by the action of hydrolases or conjugation by glutathione S-transferases [6, 12]. Thus, the biotransformation of 1 leading to 2 might be part of a detoxiﬁcation process created by the fungus. The cytotoxicity bioassay was designed to observe whether 1 and 2 could elicit cell death at the selected concentrations. Both compounds showed cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells lines comparable to that of the positive control, which was statistically signiﬁcant when compared with the negative control (p \\ 0.05). The results indicated that 1 and 2 have cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells at the lowest tested doses. Similar results were found while using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where 1 and 2 also presented cytotoxic effects, thus indicating non- selective toxicity. It has previously been shown that 1 has cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells [19], but its activity has not yet been compared with that of the derivative 2. In the same work, compound 1b was isolated from T. diver- sifolia as a natural compound and was found to be approximately 10 times more active than 1. In our work, compound 2, a C4–C5 epoxy derivative of 1b, had a sta- tistically similar activity to 1. Kupchan et al. [18] demonstrated that the in vitro cytotoxicity of STLs against human carcinoma was dependent on the presence of the a-methylene-c-lactone moiety. Moreover, evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of further derivatives indicated which functional groups con- tributed to the activity. So-called active functional groups have therefore been proposed for several STLs. It has been veriﬁed, for example, that an extra a,b-unsaturated moiety contributed to enhancing the activity of STLs with the a-methylene-c-lactone group, whereas the compounds containing only this additional unsaturation did not present signiﬁcant activity [18]. In another study, it was conﬁrmed that among other structural and electronic factors, the a,b- unsaturated carbonyl structure elements (cyclopentenone and a-methylene-c-lactone) are correlated with cytotoxicity [36]. In our work, compound 1, containing three a,b- unsaturated moieties, had statistically similar activity to 2, with only one a,b-unsaturated moiety. This suggested therefore that its extra unsaturations were not important to the effect observed in HL-60 cells. In summary, we have observed that in the presence of compound 1, enzymes from A. terreus MT 5.3 were able to generate 2 in the same way as the enzymes located in the glandular trichomes of T. diversifolia. This fungus can thus be used as an alternative source of 2 because it mimics plant biosynthetic processes. The absence of two a,b- unsaturations in 2 did not improve or decrease its cytotoxic activity in the HL-60 cells when compared with 1. Finally, we suggest that the mammalian metabolism of 1 after oral consumption of preparations containing T. diversifolia leaves should be researched in future, because this STL may form toxic compounds when metabolized.

Pupo 1 1 Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil 2 Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil Smallanthus sonchifolius is a traditional Andean plant which has been cultured mainly in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand due to its medicinal properties. A study of the endophytic fungi associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing 186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of Nigrospora sphaerica and Phoma betae liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3- methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential com- pounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-β-ol diterpene is being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including GC/MS, homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation.

H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflamma- tory effects. Some unique substances like the anti- microbial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones [1–3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF2-9), but deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South America, New Zealand and Japan [4–7]. The plant is also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal colonization. Correspondence: Dr. Mônica T.

They may have qualitatively different rela- tionships with a single host plant, from parasitism to mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are con- sidered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages none of the partners, including the absence of external manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated fungi may produce substances with specific functions inside and outside the host plant in which they nor- mally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anti- cancer [9]. As part of the bioprospecting program in endophytic fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10–13], it was considered that S. sonchifolius, commonly named Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 Production of new cytotoxic agents 143 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.jbm-journal.com bioactive secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and biotechnological purposes. Using this approach, 32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds. Some of the compounds isolated in this research are being reported for the first time as secondary metabo- lites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant asso- ciations is discussed. Materials and methods Isolation, identification and preservation of fungal strains Yacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in Febru- ary 2006, in the city of Ribeirão Preto (S 21°11.933′ NO 47°46.699′), State of São Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Fac- ulty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirão Preto campus, University of São Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. The collected plant material was washed with run- ning tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were carried out by sequentially submerging the plant mate- rial in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were ex- cised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA me- dium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 μg/ml) and incubated initially at 30 °C for 48 h, followed by 72 h at 23 °C. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures. Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure cultures were obtained. Conidia producing strains were identified at the De- partment of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil. Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 °C in tubes contain- ing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers onto PDA slants at 4 °C. Cultivation and extraction procedures Two culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for cultivation and screening of biological activities of the isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures. Liquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1). First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incu- bated at 30 °C for 7 d. After this period, aqueous sus- pensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step, this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Büchner filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask con- taining 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This proce- dure was carried out for a small scale extract produc- tion for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cul- tures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH, followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro- Figure 1.

An Erlen- meyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek me- dium and treated in the same way for control purposes. For the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled wa- ter per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 °C for 40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation, one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about 2 × 2 cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incu- bation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 °C, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and the residual fraction (RS). Isolation of compounds EaS fraction (20.2 g) of Nigrospora sphaerica was fraction- ated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column (22.0 × 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents Figure 2.

(step A, Fig. 2). Fraction M2EaS (9.9 g) was fractionated over silica gel column (CC, 230–80 mesh, 26.0 × 4.5 cm) using a gradient from with hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to MeOH (100%; step B) to provide 22 fractions.

Spectroscopic and chromatographic equipment 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (CDCl3, acetone-d6 or MeOH-d4) on Bruker spectrometers (DRX-400 or DRX- 500), working at 400 or 500 MHz for 1H, and at 100 or 125 MHz for 13C. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference. Mass spectra were performed in a high-resolution eletrospray Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (HR/ESI/MS) or in a Shimadzu GC/EI/MS OP2010 employing an AOC-20i auto-injector and a DBS- MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column. The high per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system con- sisted of a Shimadzu LC-6AD pump, and a SPD-20A UV- vis detector with a CBM-20A interface. Data acquisition was carried out on LC Solution software version 1.1. Tumor cell cultures and cytotoxic bioassay Human tumor cell lines MDA-MB435 (breast), HCT-8 (colon), SF295 (brain) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leuke- mia) were obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bo- vine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and strepto- mycin). Cultures were maintained in a humidified in- cubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cytotoxic effect was assessed using the MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability described by Mosmann [16] according to an established protocol [17]. Briefly, tumor cells were placed in 96-well plates at the following densities: 0.7 × 105 (HCT-8), 0.6 × 105 (SF295), 0.3 × 106 (HL-60) and 0.1 × 106 (MDA-MB435) cells/ml. Extracts and fractions were tested in a single concentration (100 μg/ml) and pure substances in a range between 0.048 and 25 μg/ml during 72 h. Control groups received the same amount of vehicle and doxorubicin (Doxolem®, Zodiac Produtos Farmacêuticos S/A, Brazil), which was used as a positive control. Growth inhibition rates were quantified as the percentage of control absorbance by the reduced dye at 550 nm in accordance with the following equation: Inhibition rate = [(OD control well – OD treated well) × (OD control well)–1] × 100 . Each sample was tested in two independent experi- ments performed in triplicates. The results consisted of the average value for each experimental unit. The IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were ob- tained by non linear regression using the GraphPad Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). An activity scale was utilized to appraise the cytotoxic potential of the tested samples: inactive sam- ples (I), samples with low activity (LA, cell growth inhi- bition between 1–50%), moderated activity (MA, cell growth inhibition between 50–75%), and high activity (HA, cell growth inhibition between 75–100%). Results and discussion Isolation and identification of fungal strains Altogether 32 species of fungi were isolated and labeled using the plant name initial letters and a number, for example, SS29 (Table 1).

Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization and five other species occurred simultaneously in two tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42, SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots. Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture conditions employed. They remain unidentified and were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated were identified by traditional taxonomical methods based on morphological features as established in Table 1. The isolated genera Drechslera, Fusarium, Phoma, Alter- naria, Curvularia, Nigrospora, Glomerella and Aspergilus have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a range of hosts [18–20]. They also have proven to be endophytes in several plant species [21–26] strengthen- ing the argument that disease is an exception in the plant-microbe interaction, which could be more prop- erly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis [27]. Genus Papulaspora is a well-known competitive soil mold in the culture of mushrooms [28, 29] and it has just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few species as Vitex negundo [24], Manilkara bidentata [30], Taxus chinensis [31], Amomum siamense [32] and Solanum tuberosum [25]. Preussia, however, is recognized either as a soil or a coprophilous genus [33, 34] but has never been mentioned before as an endophyte. Cytotoxic activity of extracts From the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL and RS were practically inactive (data not shown). The exceptions were RLSS33, RLSS75 and RLSS84, which Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 Production of new cytotoxic agents 147 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetate fractions from both culture types of P. immersa (SS13), N. sphaerica (SS67) and A. tenuissima (SS77) produced good results on all tested cells indicating that production of bioactive molecules by these fungi does not depend on the culture medium employed. These observations emphasize the significance of these species in future biotechnology studies. Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance of isolated compounds N. sphaerica (SS67) and P. betae (SS84) were chosen for large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive com- pounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts. Three substances were isolated from the N. sphaerica EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound 1 was identified as pimara-7,15-dien-3β-ol, compound 2 as ergosterol per- oxide and compound 3 as aphidicolin. Spectral data of compound 2 were in agreement with literature data [35], while compound 1, recently detected in a plant essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36]. This is the first report of compound 1 obtained from a fungal source and having its structure completely elu- cidated by 1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds 1 and 2 showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested (Table 3). Compound 3, isolated from the EaL fraction of N. sphaerica (SS67) had its structure established as the diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR data that are in agreement with reported data [37]. Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity 148 M. B. C. Gallo et al. Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Aphidicolin also may damage a fragile site of the mammalian genome [38, 39]. How- ever, it is a valuable tool to study eukaryotic DNA syn- thesis and cell cycles. P. betae (SS84) EaL fraction actually showed maximal efficacy against all the three cancer cell lines and was Table 3.

In liquid potato- sucrose medium, P. betae is reported to produce an as- sortment of bioactive diterpenes [40, 41], including ap- hidicolin (3), an specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resul- tant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1H NMR techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only compound 2 was isolated corroborating the initial low activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day cultures yielded compound 6, which was identified as dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines tested. The subfraction 1H NMR spectrum revealed a mixture of two substances in a 1:1 ratio, later separated and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3- one (compound 4) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl- isocoumarin (compound 5) in accordance with literature data (Fig. 4) [43, 44]. When compounds 4 and 5 were tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities, respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound 4 against other tumor cell lines had been previously described [45, 46] but the results in this report suggest that isocoumarin (compound 5) and ergosteroid (com- pound 4) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating or improving either the therapeutic effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs [47, 48] or radiotherapy [49]. Our results suggest that compounds 4 and 5 might be considered as hits for drug development of a novel anti- cancer combination therapy. The amounts of pesticides employed in S. sonchifolius cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes P. betae and N. sphaerica and their host have similar biosynthetic path- ways [52, 53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). N. spha- erica is also known to cause both reduction of spore ger- mination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic fungi, i.e, Fusarium oxysporum [55, 56], one of the isolated endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore, maintenance of N. sphaerica and P. betae as endophytes seems to be an ecological benefit to S. sonchifolius.

The ethyl acetate extract from culture of this fungus aﬀorded two benzopyran derivatives: (20S)-2-(propan-20-ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one (2) and 2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-benzopyran-4,5-diol (4); and two known benzopyrans: 2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (1) and (2R)-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (3). The structures of 2 and 4 were established on the basis of comprehen- sive spectroscopic analysis, mainly using 1D and 2D NMR experiments. The benzopyrans 1 and 2 showed weak in vitro antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides. Analyses of the biological activities were also carried out on HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, aiming to evaluate their potential eﬀects on mammalian cell line proliferation. Results from both cell lines indicated that compound 2 was able to induce cell proliferation: 70% on HeLa cells and 25% on CHO cells. 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The genus Ocotea is well known as a source of shi- kimate-derived aromatics such as benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, neolignans and pyrones (Franca et al., 1975; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989; Mandarino, 1985). Members of this genus are also widely used by Brazilian natives due to its purported pharmacological properties and resistance of the wood to fungal attacks (Chavez et al., 1995). As part of our studies on bioactive agents from metabolites produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado, we initially selected 16 species of plants, which had already been phytochemically proﬁled by our group. 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

E-mail address: araujoar@iq.unesp.br (^Angela Regina Arau´jo). www.elsevier.com/locate/phytochem Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 2363–2367 PHYTOCHEMISTRY Those species were submitted for isolation of endophytic fungi and 82 pure isolates were obtained, preserved, cul- tivated in liquid media and extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain crude extracts. The extract of a Curvularia sp. isolated from Ocotea corymbosa (Meissn.) Mez. showed moderate antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides, triggering further studies. The crude EtOAc extract aﬀorded two new benzopyran derivatives (2 and 4) and the known compounds 1 and 3, which were tested in cell proliferation and antifungal assays. Compound 2 caused a potent proliferative stimulus to two mammalian cell lines and a weak antifungal activ- ity. The dualistic activities described in this study (stim- ulatory mammalian cell proliferation and antifungal) might be of special interest in what concerns to species speciﬁcity action. 2. Results and discussion The known compounds 2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzo- pyran-4-one (1) and (2R)-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-5-meth- oxy-benzopyran-4-one (3), were identiﬁed by comparing their physical and spectroscopic data with lit- erature values (Nagasawa et al., 1988; Wu et al., 1999). A positive optical rotation displayed by compound 3, further allowed the assignment of the absolute conﬁgu- ration at C-2 as R. Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecu- lar formula C12H13O4 ([M + H]+ at m/z 221.0917). Anal- ysis of the NMR, IR and UV spectra, suggested the presence of a chromane derivative (Saengchantara and Wallace, 1990). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 1) showed a signal at d 12.70 (1H, s) attributed to a che- lated phenolic OH. Spin-systems corresponding to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring and a 2-hydroxypropyl group were also observed, along with an isolated oleﬁn proton signal. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 sig- nals (Table 1) consistent with these units and with the presence of a carbonyl group. The 13C NMR chemical shifts indicated that the benzene ring is 1,3-dioxygenated and that the carbonyl group is part of a benzopyran unit. Data from the gHMBC experiment (Table 1) sup- ported these conclusions and enabled completion of structure 2. For example, correlations of the H-1a0 pro- ton with oleﬁnic carbons C-2 and C-3 enabled location at the 2-hydroxypropyl group at C-2. In addition, the selected irradiation 1D-NOESY experiment was con- ducted on H-3 and showed NOE correlations with H- 1a0 and H-20. The absolute conﬁguration of analogue (20S)-7-hydroxy-2-(20-hydropropyl)-5-methyl-chromone has been determined as S (Kashiwada et al., 1984) and showed a positive optical rotation. Since 2 also exhibited positive speciﬁc rotation, C-20 was assigned the sinister conﬁguration. Based on these and other data and d val- ues, the structure of 2 was deﬁned as (20S)-2-(propan-20- ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one. Compound 4 was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. Its HRESI mass spectrum exhibited a [M H2O + H]+ at m/z 163.0757 corresponding to a molecular formula C10H11O2. The absence of a carbonyl band in the IR spectrum suggested reduction at this po- sition relative to 3. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) revealed the presence of the same 1,3- dioxygenated; 1,2,3-trisubstituted aromatic system for 2 along with a spin-system corresponding to the C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-10 portion of structure 4.

Small J-values showed by H-4 suggested vicinal eq–eq and eq–ax cou- plings with H2-3. The H-3eq showed constants that sug- gested a vicinal coupling eq–eq (4.0 Hz) with H-2 and eq–ax (4.0 Hz) with H-4 and a geminal coupling (14.7 Hz) with H-3ax. The 14.7, 14.7 and 4.0 Hz J-values for H-3ax indicated a geminal coupling, a vicinal ax–ax coupling with H-2 and an ax–eq coupling with H-4, respectively. Based on the conformational preference of methyl group over hydroxyl, the methyl group at C-2 was assumed to be in an equatorial position on a half-chair ring, which is the preferred conformation for benzopyrans (Joshi and Merchant, 1984). Therefore, due to equatorial position determined for H-4, com- pound 4 was characterized as the trans-isomer at H-4- H-2. All NMR signals were assigned by analysis of gHMQC and gHMBC experiments (Table 1) and d val- ues. Compound 4 was thus identiﬁed as the previously unreported 2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-benzopyran-4,5-diol. Compounds 1–4 (see Scheme 1) were evaluated against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladospo- rioides using direct bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited a weak antifungal activity, showing a detection limit of 10 lg for both sub- stances. Compound 3 and 4 did not show any antifungal activity. Nystatin was employed as a positive control showing a detection limit of 1 lg. The reduction at D2,3 in 3, changing the conformation of the pyrane ring, may be the cause of the loss of the activity. Biological evaluation of 1–4 was also carried out using HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines. Compound 2, at 20 lmol/L was able to induce 70% increase in cell proliferation to HeLa and 25% to CHO cells, when compared to the DMSO treated cells. The compounds 1, 3 and 4 were inactive in CHO and displayed a weak stimulatory eﬀect in HeLa cells. When cisplatin, a well known antineoplas- tic agent, was used as a control, a clear inhibition of cell proliferation was observed. The biological activity of 1 and 2 seems to be diﬀer- entially speciﬁc to fungi or mammalian cells, and also to diﬀerent mammalian cell lines. The indication of a possible speciﬁc mechanism of action is of great interest and deserves further investigation. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin–Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 C. UV spectra were recorded on a Shi- madzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Nicolet Impact-400 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were re- corded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as an internal standard. HRESI mass spectra were obtained on an Autospec-Micromass mass spectrometer. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm · 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm · 21.2 mm) preparative column. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated O. corymbosa plant material was col- lected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Experimental de Araraquara’’, Ara- raquara, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in 2001. The botanical identiﬁcation was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No MCMY-1314). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus For the isolation of the endophytic fungus, adult and healthy leaves were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, and immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlo- rite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was per- formed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 · 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato–dextrose–agar) and anthamicine sulfate O OCH3 O O OH O O OCH3 O O OH OH OH 2 4 6 8 1' 2' 3' 1 2 3 4 2 4 6 8 1' Scheme 1.

The material was incubated at 25 C for 10 days and the endophyte Curvularia sp. was isolated by replication and preserved in sterile water (Maier et al., 1997). The fungus was identiﬁed by Dr. Jose´ Odair Pere- ira (UFA) and deposited in NuBBEs collection with culture number ‘‘PAJ-04’’. 3.4. Growth of Curvularia and production of the EtOAc extract The fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlen- meyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 C for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 · 1 cm) of PDA med- ium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the Curvularia isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was partitioned with ethyl ace- tate (3 · 200 mL). Collection and evaporation of the or- ganic phase in vacuo yielded a brown solid residue (158 mg). After this extract was found to display bioac- tivity, this process was scaled up using 4.0 L of PDB (20 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) and aﬀorded 1.8 g of EtOAc extract. 3.5. Antifungal assay The microorganisms C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. The compounds 1–4 were applied on a pre- coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 lL) con- taining 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 lg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as posi- tive control. 3.6. Determination of cell viability after treatment with benzopyrans HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese ham- ster ovary) cells were cultured at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2, using Dulbeccos modi- ﬁed Eagles medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Penicillin (100 lg/mL) and streptomycin (100 lg/ mL) were included in medium to prevent bacterial growth. A stock solution (20 mmol/L) was prepared by dissolving compounds 1–4 in DMSO (vehicle). The ﬁnal concentrations (200, 20 and 2 lmol/L) were achieved by direct dilution into the cell medium. Cells were plated (104 cells/well) in a 48-well tray 24 h prior to the beginning of the experiment. After addition of the compound or the vehicle, cells were analyzed after a period of 48 h using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983; Rubinstein et al., 1990). 3.7. Extraction and isolation The EtOAc extract (1.8 g) was fractionated by col- umn chromatography (CC) using reversed-phase silica gel (ODS) and eluted with a MeOH–H2O gradient (1:9 100% MeOH) aﬀording 8 fractions (A–H). Fraction A (125 mg) was further puriﬁed using reverse phase prep. HPLC [k = 221 nm, 12.0 mL/ min., CH3CN:H2O (2:8)] aﬀording 1 (2.2 mg) and 2 (1.8 mg). Fraction B (100 mg) was also puriﬁed using reversed phase prep. HPLC [k = 230 nm, 12.0 mL/min., CH3CN:H2O (23:77)], aﬀording 3 (10.2 mg) and ﬁnally fraction C (770 mg) was also submitted to reverse phase prep.

A new antifungal phenolic glycoside, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-β-D-(5-O-syringoyl)- apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), together with four known iridoids, geniposidic acid (2), geniposide (3), 6α-hydroxygeniposide (4) and 6β-hydroxygeniposide (5); two lignans, (+)-lyoniresinol-3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (6), (-)-lyoniresinol-3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (7); and two phenolic acids, chlorogenic (8) and salicylic acids (9) and D-manitol (10), were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the stems of Alibertia sessilis. Structures of 1 and of the known compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All compounds isolated were evaluated for their antifungal activities against two phytopathogenic fungi strains Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum by direct bioautography. Keywords: Rubiaceae, Alibertia sessilis, phenolics, iridoids, antifungal Introduction In our continuing search for antifungal agents from plants from the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, we screened several species of the Rubiaceae family, which is recognized as a rich source of bioactive metabolites.1-5 We particularly studied plants of the Alibertia genus, since relatively few chemical studies have been reported. Our previous investigation with the leaves of A. macrophylla resulted in the isolation of antifungal iridoid aglycones, and caffeic acid ester derivatives.6,7 Additionally, flavones and coumarin have been reported for A. myrciifolia.8 This paper reports the bioassay-guided isolation and structure elucidation of the new 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1- O-β-D-(5-O-syringoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-gluco- pyranoside (1) (Figure 1), and the known lignans (+)- lyoniresinol-3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (6), (-)-lyoniresinol- 3α-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (7), which are being described for the first time for Rubiaceae. This paper also reports the isolation of iridoids geniposidic acid (2), geniposide (3), 6α- hydroxygeniposide (4) and 6β-hydroxygeniposide (5), phenolic acids, chlorogenic (8) and salicylic acid (9) and D-manitol (10). The antifungal activity of compound 1 against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides was detected by using direct bioautography. Results and Discussion The antifungal ethanol extract from Alibertia sessilis stems was partitioned with hexane, ethyl acetate and n- 1406 A New Antifungal Phenolic Glycoside Derivative, Iridoids and Lignans J. Braz. Chem. Soc. butanol. These sub-extracts were tested against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides using direct bioautography showing that only the ethyl acetate fraction was active. This sub-extract was bioassay- guide fractioned to afford a new phenolic derivative 1 along with several known compounds. Compound 1 was isolated as a brown amorphous powder. The molecular formula was determined as being C29H38O17 from the HRESIMS at m/z 657.2065 [M-H]–. The UV spectrum showed an absorption maximum at 279 nm, which is compatible with a phenolic structure. The IR spectrum showed a characteristic absorption band attributable to the following groups: carbonyl (1708 cm-1), hydroxyl (3418 cm-1), and aromatic (1605 and 1509 cm-1), as well as a glycosidic linkage (1063 cm-1). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) revealed signals for two 1,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted symmetrical aromatic rings. The 1H NMR exhibited singlet signals corresponding to five aromatic methoxyls at δH 3.77 (6H, OCH3-3,5), 3.68 (3H, OCH3-4), and 3.87 (6H, OCH3-3′′′,5′′′) and two sets of aromatic proton signals at δH 6.41 (2H, H- 2,6) and 7.34 (2H, H-2′′′,6′′′) due to a 3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl derivative and symmetrical 3,5-dimethoxy-4- hydroxy-benzoyl moieties, respectively.9 This was supported by the gHMBC spectrum, which showed cross-peaks corresponding to a long-range coupling of hydrogen at δH 6.41 and carbon signals at δC 155.9 (C-1), 154.7 (C-3,5), 134.7 (C-4) and 96.5 (C-2,6) and also between hydrogen at δH 7.34 and carbon signals at δC 167.9 (C=O), 149.1 (C-3′′′,5′′′), 143.1 (C-4′′′), 120.6 (C-1′′′) and 108.5 (C-2′′′,6′′′). Others signals observed in 1H and 13C NMR spectra are consistent with glycosyl moieties. According to literature,10 the comparison of the 13C NMR data of the glycosidic moiety of various other analogous compounds, the structure of 1 seems to be composed of a glucosyl [δC 103.2 (C-1′), 74.9 (C-2′), 77.9 (C-3′), 71.5 (C-4′), 76.9 (C-5′) and 68.2 (C-6′)] and an apiosyl [δC 110.4 (C- 1′′), 78.7 (C-2′′), 79.0 (C-3′′), 75.0 (C-4′′) and 67.9 (C-6′′)] moieties. The 1H, 13C NMR and TOCSY spectra confirmed the presence of these two sugar moieties due to the presence of two anomeric signals at δH 4.79 (d, J 7.5 Hz)/δC 103.2 (CH) for glucose and δH 5.01 (d, J 2.3 Hz)/δC 110.4 (CH) for apiose. Furthermore, the coupling constants J 7.5 Hz of the anomeric proton signal of the D-glucosyl moiety as well as the chemical shift (δC 110.4) of the anomeric carbon of the D-apiosyl moiety, demonstrated that both sugar moieties have β-anomeric configurations. The gHMBC spectrum of 1 revealed cross-peaks corresponding to long-range couplings of hydrogens H-6′ of β-glucose at δH 3.63 (d, J 10.0 Hz) and 4.06 (d, J 10.0 Hz) and carbon C- 1′′ of apiose at δC 110.4; in this way, the β-D-apiosyl moiety was attached to C-6′ of the glucose. The chemical shift of the oxymethylene carbon C-6′ (δC 68.2) was used to confirm the disaccharide linkage as apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-glucopyranoside.10 In addition, long-range correlations between H-5′′ signals of β-D- apiose [δH 4.31 (d, J 11.4 Hz) and 4.39 (d, J 11.4 Hz)] and the syringoyl carbonyl group (δC 167.9) indicated that the 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-benzoyl group was attached to C-5′′ of the β-D-apiose. Finally, the proton at δH 4.79 (H-1′ of glucose) was correlated with C-1 of the 3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl group (δC 155.9), indicating that the β-D-glucosyl moiety was located at C-1. Therefore, the structure of compound 1 was established as being 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-β-D- (5-O-syringoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-gluco- pyranoside. The known compounds 2-10 were identified by comparing their 1H and 13C NMR data with those previously published in literature.11-16 The antifungal activity of compounds 1, 2, 6-10 against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was evaluated by direct bioautography on a TLC plate.17,18 Only compound 1 exhibited moderate activity (MIC of 100 μg), when compared with the standard nystatin (1.0 μg). Experimental General experimental procedures 1D- (1H, 13C, TOCSY) and 2D- (gHMQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 126 MHz (13C), using adequate solvent with TMS as internal standard. Accurate-mass measurements were performed on a quadrupole-time of flight instrument (UltrOTOF-Q, Bruker Daltonics). IR spectrum was obtained on a Nicolet- 730 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr discs. UV absorption was measured on a Varian ProStar 330 diode array spectrophotometer. Optical rotation was measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena. Preparative HPLC was carried Figure 1.

Plant material Alibertia sessilis was collected in the Estação Ecológica e Experimental de Mogi-Guaçu (Ecological and Experimental Reserve of Mogi-Guaçu), São Paulo, Brazil in November 2003 by Dr M.C.M. Young and identified by Dr I. Cordeiro. The voucher specimen (SP 370.914) was deposited at the Botanical Institute Herbarium, São Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of constituents The dried and powdered stems (50.0 g) of A. sessilis were extracted exhaustively with ethanol, at room temperature, to give a crude material (4.15 g), which was partitioned in hexane, EtOAc and n-BuOH. After evaporation, the EtOAc extract (1.30 g) was submitted to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH as eluent to give 15 fractions after TLC analysis. Fraction 1 (116.2 mg) was composed of a precipitate, which was recrystalized with H2O to give D-manitol (10) (63.7 mg). Fraction 2 (146.4 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-18 using a gradient mixture of H2O/MeOH and MeOH/EtOAc as eluent to give 11 subfractions. Subfraction 2.1 (80.0 mg) was re- chromatographed on RP-18, eluted with H2O with increasing amounts of MeOH to afford geniposidic acid (2) (11.8 mg). Subfraction 2.7 (29.6 mg) was also submitted to column chromatography on RP-18, using a gradient solvent system of H2O/MeOH and MeOH/ EtOAc as eluent to yield 7 subfractions after TLC analysis. Subfraction 2.7.6 (18.8 mg) was chromato- graphed by preparative HPLC (C18 column; mobile phase: MeOH/H2O (3:7 v/v); flow rate: 10 mL min-1; UV detector: 238 nm) to separate the mixture of the diastereoisomeric lignans (+)-lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-D- glucopyranoside (6) (6.5 mg) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3α- O-β-D-glucopyranoside (7) (5.8 mg).19 Subfraction 2.7.7 (6.7 mg) was identified as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O- β-D-(5-O-syringoyl)-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-gluco- pyranoside (1). Fraction 4 (274.2 mg) was fractioned on RP-18 using H2O with increasing amounts of MeOH as mobile phase to give salicylic acid (9) (6.4 mg). Fractions 5 and 6 (104.9 mg) were combined and submitted to column chromatography on silica gel eluting with hexane/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH to give 6.9 mg of chlorogenic acid (8). The n-butanol extract (0.55 g) was submitted to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH as eluent to give 7 fractions after TLC analysis. Fraction 3 (180.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-18 using a gradient mixture of H2O/MeOH to give 9 subfractions.

Antifungal Assay The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays Cladosporium sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C. cladosporioides (Fresen) SPC 140 had been kept at the Botanical Institute of São Paulo, Brazil. For the antifungal assay, solutions containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 μg of the test compound were prepared. 10.0 μL of each solution was applied to pre-coated TLC plates eluted with EtOAc/ MeOH (7:3 v/v) and dried to completely remove all solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of Cladosporium sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides in glucose and salt solution and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of the compound required to eliminate the fungus (detection limits - minimum amount required for the inhibition of fungal growth on TLC plates). Nystatin was used as the positive control (1 μg).17,18 Conclusions Lignans 6 and 7 are here described for the first time as being found in Rubiaceae and the antifungal phenolic glucoside 1 is being reported for the first time in literature. Compound 10 was previously isolated from Alibertia myrciifolia. Phenolics 8 and 9 are here reported for the first time as being found in genus Alibertia.

Keywords: Piper hispidum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihy- dropyridone and piperidine moieties have been isolated from Piperaceae species (Parmar, 1997). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insec- ticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of Piper hispidum H.B.K. (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). In this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elu- cidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)-heptadienamide (1), 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one (2) and also of eight known antifungal amides N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3), piper- amine (4), N-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 -pyridin-2-one (5), piplartine (6), piperine (7), a,b- dihydropiperine (8), 5,6-dihydropiperlonguminine (9) and pellitorine (10). The amides isolated from stems of Piper hispidum (1, 3 and 4) and from seeds of Piper tubercu- latum (2, 5±10) were active against the fungus Clados- porium sphaerospermun as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). 2. Results and discussion A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of P. his- pidum was subjected to silica gel column chromato- graphy, followed by HPLC puri®cation to aord the compounds 1, 3 and 4. Compound 1, has a molecular formula C18H23NO3 as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of the 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cmÿ 1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.91 (2H, s), and four ole®nic protons which showed signals at 5.45 (1H, d, J3,4=12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, dd, J4,3 and 4,5=12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, dd, J5,4 and 5,6=12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, dt, J6,5 and 6,7=12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,-unsaturated carbonyl system.

The assignments of these ole®nic protons were con®rmed by analysis of the 1H±1H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylenic protons H-8 at 2.62 (2H, t, J8,7=7.0 Hz) and H-7 at 2.46 (2H, m) were con®rmed by the DQ- COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 ( 5.94, 1H) could be also observed. The presence of a isobutyl moiety was con®rmed by the signals at 3.13 (2H, dd, J100,200=7.0 Hz), 1.80 (1H, m) and 0.92 (6H, d, J300,200 and 400,200=7.0 Hz) attributed to H-100, H-200, H-300 and H-400, respectively. The coupling between H-100 and the NH hydrogen was con®rmed by 622 H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of 1 are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-®eld region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 166.5, ten ole®nic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; ArauÂ jo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of 1 was determined as (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8- (30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide. A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of P. tuberculatum was fractionated by column chromato- graphy on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to aord compounds 2 and 5±10. Compound 2, was shown to have a molecular formula C17H19NO5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of 13C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cmÿ 1 (asymmetric C±O±C stretching). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 revealed the presence of meth- oxyphenyl groups by the signals at 3.84 (6H, s), 3.85 (3H, s), one aromatic proton signal at 6.76 (2H, s) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four ole®nic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at 6.48 assigned to H-8 (J8,9=12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at 6.71 assigned to H-9 (J9,8=12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the Z con®guration. The attribution of this con®guration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the Z isomer when compared with the E isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at 6.89 (J4,3 and 4,5=9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at 3.97 (J6,5=7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-®eld region of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four ole®nic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at 165.7 and 168.1.

H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 623 of the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at 6.48 (H-8) and 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at 165.7 was assigned to C- 2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-®eld region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide 2 was de®ned as 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one. N- (12, 13, 14- Trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 - pyridin -2- one (5), a,b- dihydropiperine (8) and 5,6- dihydropiperlonguminine (9) have the molecular for- mula C17H21NO5, C17H21NO3 and C16H21NO3, respec- tively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), Piper guineense (Par- mar et al., 1997) and P. tuberculatum (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the ®rst time. N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)- propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3) was previously isolated from Piper peepuloides (Shah et al., 1986) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piperamine (4) was previously obtained from Piper nigrum (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piplartine (6) was pre- viously described from Piper aborescens (Duh et al., 1990) and P. tuberculatum (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (7) was previously described from P. aborescens and P. tuberculatum (ArauÂ jo-JuÂ nior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (10) had been reported from Cissampelos glaberrina (Rosario et al., 1996). The antifungal activity of amides 1±10 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds 1±10 are shown in Table 3 and were per- formed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of C. sphaerospermum growth at that level were considered inactive. The minimum quantity of compounds 1±4, 6, 8±10 necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for 7 and 5 the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively. The values for 7 and 5 were comparable to those observed for the reference compounds miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). P. hispidum and P. tuberculatum have accumulated amides with cis geometry in their side chain, which is a structural feature quite rare in nature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1986). 3.

Antifungal assay The microorganism used in the antifungal assay C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de BotaÃ nica, SaÄ o PauloÐSP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay Ð 10 ml of solutions corresponding to 100 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermun in glucose and salt solution (Rahali- son et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25C. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the mini- mal amount of 1±10 required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 mg) and miconazole (0.5 mg) were used as positive controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents The dried and powdered stems of P. hispidum (28.0 g) were extracted with CH2Cl2 (3150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 1 (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 3 (0.004 g). Frs containing 4 were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of P. tuberculatum (24.3 g) were extracted CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromato- graphic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:- EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 2 (0.024 g) and 6 (0.003 g). Fraction 20 (0.146 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 5 (0.005 g). Fraction 19 (0.083 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions] to yield 7 (0.012 g) and 8 (0.007 g). Frs. 8 and 13 yielded 10 (0.079 g) and 9 (0.018 g), respectively. 3.5.

Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed signiﬁcant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Com- pounds 1−4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three diﬀerent strains of P. falciparum in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsins B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases. F or thousands of years, plants have been used as medicines. They represent a source of structurally complex and unusual substances and are therefore an extremely attractive target for chemical and biological studies. One of the rational forms of study in the search for new potential drugs can be through screening, where a wide variety of extracts can be used for speciﬁc biological tests to obtain one or more metabolites with pharmacological potential.1 Metrodorea stipularis belongs to the family Rutaceae, a family that has a wide diversity of metabolites with large structural diversity that expresses diﬀerent pharmacological properties. Only two species of the Metrodorea genus have been investigated for their chemical constituents: M. nigra and M. flavida. M. nigra is the only species shown to contain dihydrochalcones. In addition to Metrodorea, Esenbeckia is, as of yet, the only genus found to produce this class of compound in the Rutaceae family.2−4 Chagas disease aﬀects 8 million people in Latin America, leading to an annual economic loss of approximately $18 billion. This disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. There are only two drugs used for the treatment of this disease, nifurtimox and benznidazole. The former has been banned in some countries of South America, and both cause serious side eﬀects. Cruzipain (cruzain) is an enzyme that participates in the pathway of proteolytic digestion of the parasite and plays an essential role in its life process; thus, it is an interesting biological target in the search for new compounds that can be used in the treatment of this disease.5−8 Plasmodium falciparum is the most malignant of the species causing malaria, and the progressive increase of resistant parasite strains to antimalarials has initiated studies aimed at developing new drugs that may help in the chemotherapy of this disease. Artemisinin and quinine used in the treatment of this disease are plant natural products.9 Cathepsins are cysteine proteases involved in several pathological situations, such as in the progression of malignant tumors and metastases, infectious disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. The malignant tumors are mostly nonencapsulated and invasive, making it diﬃcult for surgical resection. Evidence suggests that cathepsins B and L may facilitate the progression of tumors, and studies of the expression of these enzymes in diﬀerent types of cancer have shown an increase in the expression of cathepsins in humans.10,11 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In a search for new antichagasic compounds, extracts from several Brazilian plants of the Rutaceae family were evaluated against cruzain. The dichloromethane fraction from liquid− Received: June 4, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/jnp © XXXX American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy A dx.doi.org/10.1021/np500453x | J. Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX liquid partitioning of the crude ethanol extract from the stems of M. stipularis showed the most promising results, with inhibition of 80% against cruzain at a concentration of 100 μg/ mL. Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6- trihydroxyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1- (5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dime- thylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)- phenyl]propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H- xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2 Compounds 2 and 3 were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESITOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at m/ z 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for 2 and 3, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C25H30O5 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for 2 and 3 showed one singlet at δ 5.92 attributed to H-8′, the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both 2 and 3 the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at δ 1.76 (H-3′) and 2.53 (H-4′) and the methyl groups at δ 1.33 (H-9′ and H-10′). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at δ 6.91 (H-5″ and H-7″) and 6.56 (H-8″) for 2 and signals at δ 6.87 (H-2″), 6.83 (H-6″), and 6.64 (H-5″) for 3 assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound 2 showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at δ 1.73 (H-3″) and 2.69 (H-4″) and the signals of the methyl groups at δ 1.22 (H-8″ and H-9″). Compound 3 displayed one prenyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at δ 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4‴ and H-5‴), one oleﬁnic hydrogen at δ 5.28 (H-2‴), and the methylene signal at δ 3.25 (H-1‴). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in 1 and conﬁrmed the structures of 2 and 3. Compound 4 was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESITOFMS data showed the molecular ion at m/z 478.2714 (calculated m/z 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O5. As mentioned for compounds 2 and 3, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the character- istic signals of the three methyl groups at δ 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at δ 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and conﬁrmed the structure of 4. The dihydrochalcones 1−4 showed inhibition activities against cruzain, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the ﬁrst report of cruzain inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies. Dihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochal- cones 1 and 3 showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these com- pounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more eﬀective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydro- chalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsins such as cathepsin K.12 The dihydrochalcones were also tested against Plasmodium falciparum growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against P. falciparum the dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 showed signiﬁcant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 μM for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against P. falciparum growth for this class of compounds. Four compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases cruzain and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The results described in this paper are signiﬁcant, since this is the ﬁrst report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against cruzain, and it is interesting that compounds 2 and 4 are active against cathepsin B, while compounds 1 and 3 are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of ﬁnding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. All commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co., and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-d6 and methanol-d4, using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe ATMA). MS data were colledted on a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF-Q II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H2SO4/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230−700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna). Plant Materials. The stems of Metrodorea stipularis were collected in July 2010 at the Agronomic Institute in Campinas, SP; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute. Journal of Natural Products Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/np500453x | J. Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B Extraction and Isolation. The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 °C, aﬀording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid−liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against cruzain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed signiﬁcant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromato- graphed over silica gel 60 (φ = 5.0 cm × h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10:0, 15:5, 5:5, 0:10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1− MSD24). Fraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15_1− MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg). Fraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 3.0 cm × h = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD21_1−MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD21_8_1−MSD21_8_20). Subfraction MSD21_8_12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21_8_19 (9 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, φ = 1.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/ACN/H2O (4:1:5) as mobile phase and a ﬂow of 3.5 mL/min to aﬀord 4 (2.5 mg). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2066 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3- methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl]propan-1-one (3): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2040 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl- 2,3,4,4a, 9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4): amor- phous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 2; ESITOFMS m/z 478.2714 (calcd for C30H38O5 m/z 478.2720). Enzyme Inhibition Assays. Cruzain. All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectroﬂuorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured by the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanylarginine-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide). The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.3) with 5 μL of DTT at 37 °C after addition of 2 μL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control).

Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic ﬂuorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and a concentration of 185 μM for catB and 10 μM for catL. The enzyme was activated for 5 min with DTT and acetate buﬀer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 200 μL, kept under stirring (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with at least seven inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot 12.0. Bioassay of Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth. The strains 3D7, W2, and Dd2 of P. falciparum malaria parasites (BEI Resources, MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in human type O+ erythrocytes in complete medium (RPMI 1640 (Cellgro), 0.043 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 0.014 mg/mL hypoxanthine (Acros), 38.5 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.18% NaHCO3 (Cellgro), 0.20% Glucose (MP Biomedical), 0.003 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.2% Albumax (Gibco), 5% human serum) as previously described.14 Brieﬂy, cultures were maintained in 25 cm3 ﬂasks (Corning) at a volume of 10 mL and were gassed for 30 s with an environment of 3% CO2, 1% O2, and 96% N2, then incubated at 37 °C. The antimalarial activity was determined with a SYBR Green based parasite proliferation assay, adapted from Smilkstein15 and Bennett.16 Using this technique, the increase of parasite DNA contained in human red blood cells was measured after 72 h of incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds.17 Relative ﬂuorescence values were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM ﬂuorimeter (excitation 495 nm and emission 525 nm). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and plotted with SigmaPlot 10 (Systat). ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The 1H, HSQC, and HMBC NMR spectra of the compounds.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of Piper arboreum yielded two new amides, N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) together with the known compounds N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E), 9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4). Catalytic hydrogenation of 3 yielded the amide N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5). We also have isolated six amides (6–11) and two antifungal cinnamoyl derivatives (12, 13) from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum. Compounds 1–11 showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against Cladosporium sphaerospermum while compounds 3-4 and 6–13 also showed antifungal activity against C. cladosporioides. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Keywords: Piper arboreum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Chemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, lig- noids and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996; Parmar et al, 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadie- noyl]pyrrolidine, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl- 8-(30,40-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Ale´ cio et al., 1998) and 8(Z)-N- (12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one from Piper tuberculatum Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)- pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) and nine (3–11) known antifungal amides N-[10- (13,14-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3), its deri- vative N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)- 7(E),9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4); besides pellitorine (6), abdihydropiperine (7), piplartine (8), dihydro- piplartine (9), cis-piplartine (or 8(Z)-N-(12,13, 14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one) (10) and fagaramide (11). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxy- dihydrocinnamate (12) and methyl trans-6,7,8-trimethox- ycinnamate (13). The amides isolated from leaves of Piper arboreum (1–4) and the hydrogenated derivative of 3 (5) were active against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum 3, 4 and 6–13 0031-9422/02/$ - see front matter # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results and discussion N-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pen- tadienoil]-pyrrolidine (1) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electro- spray mass spectrum (ES–MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.93 (2H, s), and four oleﬁnic protons which showed signals at 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7=14.3 and J8,9=10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8=10.9 and J9,10=11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9= 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the E and Z geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the E and Z conﬁgurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of trans-trans conﬁguration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assign- ment of the cis conﬁguration for the g, double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at 3.52 (2H, m) and 1.90 (2H, m) attrib- uted to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of 1 were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-ﬁeld region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 164.8, 10 sp2 car- bons, four sp3 carbons [C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Arau´ jo-Junior et al., 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). Arboreumine (2) was shown to have the molecular formula C25H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES–MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respec- tively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at 2.15 (2H, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H- 20a and H-2b, H-20b which are characteristic of methyl- ene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-90, at 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at 1.20 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-110; H-13, H-120; H-14, H-130 and H-11, H-100, respectively. The signal at 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as conﬁrmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-50; H-8, H-70 and H-9, H-80 showed signals at 5.81 (q, J6,1250,110= 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (dd, J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1,0 Hz) and 5.76 (dd, J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further conﬁrmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-70; H-9, H- 80 and H-10, H-90 was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at 5.76 assigned to H- 9, H-80 (J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-70 (J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-90 (J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 assigned to H-11, H- 100 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-20a (J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at 2.37 assigned to H- 2b, H-20b (J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spec- tral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum.

Vasques da Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 59 (2002) 521–527 523 assigned to C-2, C-20 and C-3, C-30, respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the car- bon (C-3 and C-30), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at 198.3 and the 3H singlet at 0.95 (C- 14 and C-130) indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-20a and H-2b, H-20b ( 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 ( 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-120 and C-14, C-130 and H-14, H-130 and C-13, C-120 were also observed. The carbon signals at 163.9 (C-5, C-40), 126.1 (C-6, C-50) and 40.9 (C-3, C-30) showed a correla- tion with the 1H singlet at 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at 2.15 (H-2a, H-20a), corroborating the adjacent rela- tionship between the amide group and C-2, C-20. The carbon signals at 67.3 (C-10, C-90) and 135.6 (C-9, C- 80) showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-100 adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,- unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambigu- ously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 110 with the carbon signals 126.1 (C-6, C- 50) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70), whereas the quadruplet at 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-50 (J6,1250,110=1,0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70). Finally, HET- COR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide 2 was determined as depicted. The CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of P. tuberculatum were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C6H14 con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to aﬀord compounds 6–13. Pellitorine (6) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further puriﬁcation, and it was identiﬁed by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data pre- viously described by Rosario et al., 1996. a,bdihydro piperine (7) and dihydropiplartine (9) had their 1H NMR spectra published for the same compounds pre- viously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and Piper guineense (Parmar et al., 1997) and their 13C NMR spectral data recently pub- lished (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (8) was iso- lated from seeds and leaves, and the 1H and 13C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). Cis-piplartine (10) had its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (11) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl trans-6,7,8-tri- methoxycinnamate (13) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectro- scopic data were similar to that obtained in this work. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–13 was deter- mined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of com- pounds 1–13 (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered. The minimum amount of compounds 3–4; 2 and 5; and 1 required to inhibit growth of the fungus C. sphaero- spermum on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the stan- dards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against C. cladosporioides, the amide 4 being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds 6–10, 13 and 11, 12 the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus C. clados- porioides on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for 6–10 and 13 indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from P. arboreum are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the Table 2 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 2 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 2 1H [m, J (Hz), 500 MHz] 13C a (125 MHz) 1, 10 2.80 (1H, s) – 2a, 20a 2.15 (1H, d, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0) 49.5 (t) 2b, 20b 2.37 (1H, d, J 2b,2a20b,20a=17.0) 3, 30 – 40.9 (s) 4 – 198.3 (s) 5, 40 – 163.9 (s) 6, 50 5.81 (1H, q, J6,1250,110=1.0) 126.1 (d) 7, 60 – b 8, 70 5.70 (1H, dd, J8,970,80 and 8,1270,110=15.5, 1.0) 128.6 (d) 9, 80 5.76 (1H, dd, J9,880,70 and 9,1080,90=15.5, 5.0) 135.6 (d) 10, 90 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80 and 10,1190,100=5.0, 6.5) 67.3 (d) 11, 100 1.20 (3H, d, J 11,10100,90=6.5) 23.4 (q) 12, 110 1.83 (3H, s) 19.0 (q) 13, 120 1.00 (3H, s) 22.7 (q) 14, 130 0.95 (3H, s) 23.8 (q) a Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment. b This signal was not observed in the 13C NMR spectrum. 524 R.

It is important to note that the inhibi- tion of C. sphaerospermum by dihydropyridone amide 9 appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of C. cladosporioides was lower than the standards (Table 4). 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck 230–400 mesh) was used for all col- umn chromatography unless otherwise stated and sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spec- trometer. ES–MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), ﬂow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were per- formed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser. 3.2. Plant material Piper arboreum H. B. K. leaves were collected in Araraquara—SP, Brazil and identiﬁed by Dr. Guil- lermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Bio- cie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. Piper tuberculatum Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA—Manaus, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher speci- mens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biocie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. 3.3. Antifungal assays The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C. cladospor- ioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Bota.nica, Sa˜ o Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay—10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds 1–5 and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds 6–13, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in dark- ness in a moistened chamber at 25 C. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of 1–5 and 6–13 required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chlor- amphenicol were used as negative controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents A CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of P. arboreum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides 1–4. The dried and powdered leaves of P. arboreum (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The result- ing EtOH extract was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively.

Fraction 19 (1.7 g) was applied to a C18 HPLC column (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). After that the fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2: (CH3)2CO (92:02) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 1 (28.0 mg) and 3 (31.0 mg). Fraction 21 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 col- umn (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC eluted with CH2Cl2:(CH3)2CO:MeOH (92:0.5:0.5) and HOAc (1%) to give 2 (8.0 mg). Fraction 23 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 column (2.0 g) and eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2:C6H14: (CH3)2CO (6:3:1) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 3 (83.0 mg) and 4 (30.0 mg). The dried and powdered seeds and leaves of P. tuber- culatum (24.3 g) were extracted 2 with 600 ml of CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1), during 2 days (each extraction), at room temperature. The resulting extract of seeds was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 8 (33.0 mg) and 10 (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yiel- ded 9 (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds 6 (0.2 g) and 7 (18.0 mg), respec- tively, without any further puriﬁcation. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26–62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier. Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide 8 (0.9 g), without further puriﬁcation. Amide 11 (7.0 mg) was isolated from fraction 55 (0.2 g), which was further puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O(4:1)]. Fraction 28 (0.4 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), two elutions] yielding the cinnamoyl derivative 12 (66.0 mg) and fraction 67–68 (0.4 g) was puriﬁed by two prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1), two elutions and C6H14: EtOAc (7:3), one elution], respectively, to yield the cin- namoyl derivative 13 (13.0 mg). 3.5.

The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent, and the esters were significantly more effective than gallic acid. Gallic acid and its esters were compared with regard to their reactivity to free radicals, using the DPPH and AAPH/pyranine free- cell assays, and no significant difference was obtained. Gallic acid and its esters not only failed to inhibit the depletion of intracellular GSH in erythrocytes induced by AAPH but exacerbated it. Similarly, the oxidation of GSH by AAPH or horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in cell-free systems was exacerbated by gallic acid or gallates. This property could be involved in the recent findings on pro- apoptotic and pro-oxidant activities of gallates in tumor cells. We provide evidence that lipophilicity and not only radical scavenger potency is an important factor regarding the efficiency of anti- hemolytic substances. KEYWORDS: Gallic acid; gallates; erythrocytes; hemolysis; glutathione; peroxyl radical; antioxidant; pro-oxidant activity INTRODUCTION Gallic acid and its derivatives are among the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in wines and green tea (1-3). This phyto- chemical is well-known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti- inflammatory, antimutagenic, and chemopreventive properties (4-7). The similar beneficial effects of the synthetic esters of gallic acid have been extensively studied, and in many cases, they are stronger than those of gallic acid itself. For instance, lauryl gallate (dodecyl gallate), a widely used food additive, is more efficient than gallic acid as an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, and of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by FeIII-NADPH (8). Methyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid at inhibiting oral bacterial growth and the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms (4). Methyl gallate inhibits the production of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2 by bone-marrow-derived mast cells (9). Nonyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid against the growth of Salmonella choleraesuis (10). Lauryl gallate protects against the formationofdimethylbenzanthracene-inducedskintumorsinmice and kills, selectively, tumor cells in established tumors (11). Such biological activities have been correlated with the amphipathic feature of these ester derivatives (12), because the in vitro antioxi- dantpotentialisnearlythesameas thatofgallicacid. Hence, itmay be supposed that the accessibility of the gallates to the intracellular medium could be a determining factor for their effects. Another relevant property of gallates is their pro-oxidant characteristics. Indeed, the cytotoxic effect of octyl, dodecyl, and tetradecyl gallates on melanoma cells has recently been demonstrated (13, 14). This biological effect has been associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of NF-κB, inhibition of cell adhesion, and alteration of the cell redox status by depletion of both glutathione (GSH) and ATP (13). Similarly, the inhibition of HeLa cell growth by propyl gallate was associated with depletion of intracellular GSH and increased production of the superoxide anion (14). The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced disruption of cell membranes and the protective effect of antioxi- dants. One of the most frequently studied models uses the water- solubleazocompound2,20-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), which decomposes at physiological temperature (37 C) *To whom correspondence should be addressed: Departamento de Quı´mica, Faculdade de Ci^encias, UNESP, Bauru, SP, CEP 17033-360, Brazil.

In the presence of dissolved molecular oxygen, this radical is converted to the corresponding peroxyl radical (ROO•) (15). The mechanism of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by thermolysis of AAPH is not completely understood, but it has been correlated with lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins (16). The incubation of erythro- cytes with AAPH also provokes the depletion of intracellular GSH (17). Because the above biological phenomenon is associated with the disruption of the cell membrane and in view of increasing evidence that the lipophilicity of gallic acid esters is decisive for their beneficial effects, here, we aimed to synthesize selected gallate esters and compare their efficacy as inhibitors of AAPH- induced hemolysis and GSH depletion. The objective was to retain the same oxidizable moiety while altering the lipophili- city. Additionally, we studied and compared the antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of gallic acid and gallates in cell-free systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and Equipments. Gallic acid,vanillicacid,methylvanillate, (()-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), (()-R-tocopherol (vitamin E), 2,20-azobis(2- amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), 5,50-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), glutathione (GSH), 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (pyranine), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), N,N0- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, cumene hydroperoxide (Cu-OOH), horserad- ish peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1.7), and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was prepared bydiluting a 30% stock solution and calcul- ating its concentration from its absorption at 240 nm (ε240=43.6 M-1 cm-1) (18). Column chromatography was carried out over 0.06-0.20 mm silica gel (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). Gel permeation chromato- graphy (GPC) was performed with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out in a Varian Prep-Star 400 system with a Pheno- menex C-18 (250 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvents (Aldrich). All of the reagents used for buffers and mobile phases were analytical-grade. Stock solutions of antioxidants were prepared in ethyl alcohol. Ultrapure Milli-Q water from Millipore was used for the preparation of buffers and solutions. Gallic Acid Source. Gallic acid was extracted from Alchornea glandulosa. The leaves were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac-u, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen(SP319257) has beendeposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (S~ao Paulo, SP, Brazil). The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L 3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH/H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After solvent removal in a rotary evaporator, the partition phases yielded 2.5 and 0.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromato- graphed bygel permeation over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol, to afford 11 fractions (A1-A11). Second-stage chromatographic purifica- tion of fraction A2 (730 mg) by reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC (7.5:92:0.5 MeOH/H2O/HOAc, UV detection at 265 nm, and flow rate at 15 mL/min) yielded gallic acid (335 mg). The identification was based on analysis of 1H and 13C NMR data, as well as by a comparison to authentic material obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Synthesis of Esters (Methyl, Propyl, and Lauryl). A 3 mL solution of N,N0-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane was added to a cooled (5 C) solution of 0.2 mmol of gallic acid and 20 mmol of methyl, propyl, or lauryl alcohol in 6 mL of p-dioxane. After the solution was stirred for 48 h, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned 3 times with EtOAc and filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (3 times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (3 times), and water (2 times), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column eluted isocratically with CHCl3/MeOH (98:2). Structures of the semi-synthetic esters were estab- lished by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis. Erythrocyte Suspension. Human erythrocytes from healthy donors were obtained from peripheral blood, centrifuged at 770g for 10 min, and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. The supernatant and buffy coat were removed by aspiration after each wash. The cells were resuspended to 20% (v/v) in PBS. The blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers. The study was approved by the faculty research ethics committee. Hemolysis Assays. The hemolysis studies were performed as pre- viously described (19), with modifications. Equal amounts of erythrocytes suspension and 100 mM AAPH in PBS were gently homogenized while being incubated for 6 h at 37 C (blood tube rotator). Aliquots (75 μL) were removed at regular intervals, diluted 1:20 with PBS, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The degree of hemolysis was measured in the supernatant by its absorbance at 540 nm. Reference values (100% hemolysis) were determined with the same aliquot of erythrocytes but diluted in 1500 μL of distilled water instead of PBS to provoke the total lysis of the erythrocytes. By diluting the 100% hemolysis sample in PBS, a calibration curve of percent hemolysis against absorbance was constructed for conversion of the absorbance measurement to degrees of hemolysis. The blank was PBS, and measurements were made in a UV-1240 spectro- photometer (Shimadzu, Japan). When used, 10 μL aliquots of inhibitors in ethanol were added at the beginning of the reaction. The same volume of ethyl alcohol (10 μL) was added to the negative (without AAPH) and positive (with AAPH) controls. In the studies where cumene hydroper- oxide (Cu-OOH) was the hemolytic agent, this compound (500 μM) was used instead of AAPH. Determination of Intracellular GSH. The intracellular concentra- tion of GSH in erythrocytes was determined using the DTNB method (19), with modifications. The 20% suspension of erythrocytes (100 μL) was incubated with 100 μL of 50 mM AAPH at 37 C for 2.0 h. After incubation, the suspension was diluted to 1000 μL with PBS and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was lysed by adding 700 μL of distilled H2O. The protein in 700 μL of lysate was precipitated by adding 500 μL of an aqueous solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After 5 min, the protein precipitate was separated from the remaining solution by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (500 μL) was made alkaline by adding 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 62.5 μL of NaOH (1 M). Next, 450 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 100 μL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate) were added to 450 μL of the alkaline mixture. In the blank, 500 μL of supernatant was mixed with 250 μL of PBS instead of 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 and 62.5 μL of NaOH, after which 450 μL of PBS and 100 μL of DTNB were added to 450 μL of this mixture. Each sample test or control had its blank. The absorbance was read at 412 nm. A standard curve was constructed to measure the concentration of GSH. In this case, 700 μL of lysate was replaced by 700 μL of solutions of GSH at several concentrations. The hemoglobin content (Hb) in an aliquot of the lysate (prior precipitation with TCA) was determined by the cyanohemoglobin method. The GSH values were expressed as μmol/g Hb (20). Oxidation of GSH by AAPH. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 2.5 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C for 1.0 h (21). When present,gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added beforethe addition of AAPH. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured bythe DTNB method as follows: 0.45 mL of the reaction mixture was added to 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.1 mL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate). The absorbance at 412 nm was read against a blank consisting of 0.45 mL of PBS, 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.1 mL of DTNB. An analytical curve was produced using standard GSH solutions, which were submitted to the DTNB methods. Oxidation of GSH by HRP/H2O2. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at 37 C (21). When present, gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured by the DTNB method as above. Measurement of GSH and GSSG by HPLC. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at Article J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5357 37 C. When present, apocynin, gallic acid, and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The concentration of GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection, as previously described (22): For GSH determination, 50 μL of the above reaction mixture was added to 1.0 mL of 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. To a 20 μL aliquot of this mixture, 300 μL of 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0 and 20 μL of 0.1% OPA in methanol were added and this reaction mixture was incubated at 25 C for 15 min in the dark in well-capped tubes, after which 20μL ofeachsamplewas injectedintothe HPLCsystem. For GSSG determination, a 200 μL aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 C with 200 μL of 40 mM NEM, for 25 min, in the dark, to react with the GSH present in the sample. To this mixture, 750 μL of 0.1 M NaOH was added. A 20 μL portion of this mixture was taken for measurement of GSSG, using the procedure outlined above for the GSH assay, except that 0.1 M NaOH was employed as the diluent rather than 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. The HPLC method for the determination of GSH and GSSG is based on derivatization with OPA to form a stable, highly fluorescent derivative (23). The derivatives of GSH and GSSG were separated by liquid chromatography (Varian ProStar in line with a fluorescence detector set at 350/420 nm). The analyses were carried out isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of 15% methanol in 25 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 6.0 (flow rate of 0.5 mL/min). Measurement of Oxygen Consumption. The consumption of dis- solved molecular oxygen during the oxidation of GSH was monitored in a YSI 5300A oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring, OH). The reaction mixture of 1 mM GSH, 100 μM H2O2, and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS was incubated at 37 C in the presence or absence (control) of 10 μM apocynin or gallates. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. The oxygen consumption was monitored for 10 min. Pyranine-Based Procedure for Evaluation of the Reactivity of Gallates with Peroxyl Radicals Generated by AAPH Thermolysis. This experiment was performed as described by Lissi et al. (24), with minor modifications. The experiments were based on the decay in the fluores- cence of pyranine when it was submitted to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compound pyranine (5 μM) was incubated with 20 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C in the absence (control) or presence of gallates in the wells of a microplate. The fluorescence bleaching of the pyranine was monitored at λex=460 nm and λem=510 nm in a Spectramax M2 micro- plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The final reaction volume was 300 μL. The lag phase (induction time) obtained when the antioxidants were present was measured for various concentrations of each gallate. The slopes of the curves of induction time versus concentra- tion were used to measure the relative reactivity of the gallates with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. Free-Radical Scavenging Activity on DPPH/DPPH Bleaching Assay. The free-radical scavenger activity of gallic acid and its esters was compared by the DPPH bleaching assay (25). The antioxidants were incubated for 30 min with 100 μM DPPH in methyl alcohol in the dark. The scavenger activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm, using the absorbance of the unreacted DPPH radical as the control. The scavenger activity was calculated as ((absorbance of the control - absorbance of the sample)/absorbance of the control) 100. RESULTS We studied the hemolysis of erythrocytes and the protective effect of gallic acid and its esters. The molecular structures of the compounds studied are shown in Figure 1. Hemolysis was provoked by thermolysis of the azo compound AAPH, which generates a low but constant flux of peroxyl radicals when incubated at 37 C (15). Figure 2 shows the kinetic profile of hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid and propyl gallate. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent (Figure 3), and the esters methyl gallate (G1), propyl gallate (G3), and lauryl gallate (G12) were more effective inhibitors than their acid precursor, gallic acid (G0) (Table 1). Because the above results suggest a higher efficacy of the esters as free-radical scavengers, we also compared their relative potency in cell-free models. First, they were compared as scav- engers of the stable free-radical DPPH. The results depicted in Table 2 show that no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its ester derivatives. In a second set of experiments, we studied the direct reactivity of gallic acid and its esters with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. In this assay, the relative reactivity of the antioxidants with peroxyl radicals is determined by the lag phase in the decay of pyranine fluorescence (24). Figure 4 shows the typical time profile of the bleaching obtained when pyranine was incubated with AAPH in the presence of gallic acid and methyl gallate. The linear relation between the delay and the concentration of gallic acid or gallates was used to measure the reactivity of the tested compound with AAPH. In this design, the slope of the curve is directly proportional to the efficiency of the antioxidant as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals. Figure 4 also shows the typical linear correlation between the concentration and lag phase for gallic acid and methyl gallate. The slopes obtained were 442 ( 30 for gallic acid, 499 ( 31 for methyl gallate, 453 ( 6 for propyl gallate, and 187 ( 7 for lauryl gallate (mean ( SEM, n = 3). As can be observed, only lauryl gallate presented a Figure 1. Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study. Figure 2. AAPH-induced hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3). The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C. The results are mean ( standard error of the mean (SEM) of duplicates of three separate experiments. 5358 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 Ximenes et al. decreased reactivity with peroxyl radicals in this experimental model. Considering the above cell-free studies, the stronger antihemo- lytic effect of the gallates, relative to that of gallic acid, suggests that lipophilicity is a determining factor in this experimental model. To verify this proposal, we also compared the antioxidant vanillic acid versus its methyl ester (methyl vanillate) and trolox, a morewater-soluble form ofvitamin E,versusvitamin E itself. The results with these two different classes of antioxidants followed the same pattern as that for gallates and gallic acid, reinforcing the suggestion that lipophilicity of antioxidants is crucial with respect to antihemolytic protection (Table 1). The direct hemolytic capacity of gallic acid and gallates was also investigated, because these compounds could interact with and disrupt the erythrocyte membrane. In these experiments, gallic acid and gallates were incubated with erythrocytes with- out AAPH. The results in Table 3 show that only the 12-carbon ester lauryl gallate caused significant hemolysis after incubation for 6 h. The protective effect of gallates was not restricted to AAPH- induced hemolysis. The results given in Table 4 show that gallates were also effective when the hemolysis was provoked by incuba- tion of erythrocytes with cumene hydroperoxide. Again, there was a correlation with lipophilicity. In a further experiment, the protective effect of gallic acid and gallates on the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by AAPH was also studied. Despite their antihemolytic properties, gallic acid and gallates were unable to inhibit the oxidation of GSH when erythrocytes were incubated with AAPH. On the contrary, the depletion of GSH was exacerbated by methyl and lauryl gallates (Table 5). To clarify these findings, we studied the direct reaction between pure GSH and AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and tested the effect of gallic acid and gallates on this reaction. Again, the presence of gallic acid and gallates tended to exacerbate the oxidation of GSH (Figure 5). In another set of experiments, pure GSH was oxidized by H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by HRP. Because GSH is a poor substrate for peroxidase, the efficiency of oxidation was low (26). However, the addition of gallic acid and gallates caused a strong increase in the oxidation of GSH (Figure 6). It is well-known that some phenolic compounds are able to act as a co-catalyst in reactions of inefficient peroxidase substrates, such as GSH. In such situations, the oxidized intermediate phenolic radical is reduced back and GSH is converted to GSSG. Moreover, during this redox cycle, the dissolved molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture is consumed, being reduced to superoxide anion (27). For these reasons and in light of our results, we measured the production of GSSG and the oxygen consumption as GSH was oxidized by HRP/H2O2 in the presence of gallic acid or gallates. To ascertain whether our experimental conditions for assessing the co-catalytic effectof phenols upon the oxidation of GSH was correct, we used apocynin, which is able to initiate this process, as a reference compound (28). As can be seen in Figure 7, both gallic acid and apocynin exacerbated the oxidation of GSH; however, only in the presence of apocynin was GSSG obtained as a product. Similarly, only in the presence of apocynin was the consumption of dissolved oxygen observed (Figure 8). The other gallates showed the same results as gallic acid (data not shown). DISCUSSION The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model in the study of ROS-induced disruption of cell membranes. The inhibitory property of many antioxidants upon AAPH-induced hemolysis is well-documented (29-32). However, there is no clear relationship between the molecular structure of the antioxidants and their efficiency as inhibitors. Here, working with gallic acid and its ester derivatives, we found Figure 3. Concentration-dependent effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3) on AAPH-induced hemolysis.

Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5359 that lipophilicity seems to be an essential characteristic of an efficient antihemolytic compound. Similar findings were reported by Wu et al. that ranked the antihemolytic efficiency of gallates as propyl > ethyl > methyl (33). Corroborating this proposal, the correlation between efficacy against AAPH-induced hemolysis and lipophilicity was not restricted to gallic acid and its ester derivatives but extended to other classes of molecules, such as vanillic acid versus its lipophilic derivative methyl vanillate and trolox versus vitamin E. Moreover, the benefit of lipophilicity was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis, because it was also seen when the erythrocytes were challenged with cumene hydro- peroxide. Reinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, our result showed clearly that higher antihemolytic efficacy of the gallates was not related to their oxidizability. Indeed, except for lauryl gallate, no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its esters in their potential as antioxidants in cell-free systems. Only the 12-carbon chain ester was relatively poor as a peroxyl radical scavenger in the cell-free systems. Despite that and again reinfor- cing the importance of lipophilicity, lauryl gallate was a more efficient inhibitor of hemolysis than gallic acid. It is important to observe that any compound used as an antihemolytic agent when erythrocytes are challenged by free Figure 4.

This effect has been described, and there is a relationship between lipophilicity and hemolytic capacity deve- loped by many compounds (34, 35). Accordingly, lauryl gallate, the most lipophilic compound used in this study, was the only ester capable of inducing hemolysis of erythrocytes under our experimental conditions. Other important findings include the interaction of gallic acid and gallates with GSH. This chemical feature could explain or be involved in the recent findings about cellular pro-oxidant effects of gallates (13, 14). This tripeptide is the main endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) reflects directly the redox status of the cell (36). It is well-known that redox homeostasis is crucial for cells to survive, and the pathophysiological mecha- nisms ofseveral diseasesare related tothe exacerbated production of ROS and/or decreased antioxidant functions (37). In fact, apoptosis, which is altered in tumor cells, strongly depends upon the GSH/GSSG ratio (38, 39). Two pathways could explanation the exacerbated oxidation of GSH whengallates are present in the reaction mixture or cellular medium. The first is the action of these compounds as co-catalysts, where the intermediate pheno- xyl radical would be reduced back to gallate with concomitant oxidation of GSH. This phenomenon is well-established for phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine and apocynin (27, 28), and the consequence of this redox cycle is the consumption of GSH, the formation of GSSG, and the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion (40). This was exactly what we observed for apocynin, used as a model for a comparison to gallates in this study. However, when gallates were used, the consumption of GSH was not followed by the formation of GSSG and the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Hence, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for the augmented depletion of GSH caused by gallic acid and gallates. The second possible explanation for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates in the depletion of intracellular GSH is a chemical reaction between the oxidized trihydroxybenzene moi- ety, probably in its quinone form, and GSH via the Michael Figure 5.

This is a well-known reaction that involves electrophilic quinones and nucleophilic substances, such as GSH, leading to thiol adducts (41,42). In this case, the consumption of GSH is not followed by the formation of GSSG and oxygen consumption, as verified here. In summary, Scheme 1 shows our proposal for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates when these compounds were oxidized in the presence of GSH, which could explain the depletion of intracellular GSH as verified here and by others (13, 14).

(Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a familiar Brazilian species popularly known as Tarum˜a whose leaf tea has been used by population to treat kidney diseases. The aim of this research was to investigate the hydroalcoholic extract of leaves in order to isolate the active compounds. Hydroalcoholic extract of leaves was obtained by stirring the previous hexane and methanol extracted leaves residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing. The obtained extract was partitioned with n-butanol. The yielded fraction was subsequently submitted to several chromatographic procedures to lead to the isolation of O-glycosidicﬂavones orientin and isoorientin as well as C-glycosylﬂavones schaftoside and carlinoside along with their isomers, known as potent anti-inﬂammatory, antinociceptive and antioxidant agents, then identiﬁed as the active constituents, justifying the folk use of the plant to combat and prevent kidney stone and inﬂammation. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

(Lamiaceae, according to Cantino et al., 1992; formerly Verbenaceae, in keeping with Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the States of Minas Gerais, Esp´ırito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and S˜ao Paulo (Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957). The plant was col- lected in July 2000, in the city of Poc¸os de Caldas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and authenticated by Dr. F´atima Regina Salimena-Pires, a taxonomic botanist from Universi- dade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Faculdade de Filosoﬁa, Ciˆencias e Letras da Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, campus Ribeir˜ao Preto (SPFR), Brazil, under the acquisition number 9968. ∗Corresponding author.

Use in traditional medicine The leaf tea is used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat and prevent kidney stone and inﬂammation (Rodrigues, 2001). 3. Previously isolated classes of constituents In preceding studies, Vitex polygama has been found to contain sesquiterpenes, fatty acids (Barbosa et al., 1995), 2′′-O- caffeoylorientin besides other common ﬂavones simultaneously with some O-glycosylated derivatives, ﬂavonols, phenolic acids (Leit˜ao and Delle Monache, 1998), several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the essential oil (Leit˜ao et al., 1999), phy- tosteroids, caffeoylesters from quinic acid (Santos, 2000), and ecdysteroids (Santos et al., 2001). 4. Materials and methods The powder of the air-dried leaves (423.0 g) was extracted successively with hexane and methanol (MeOH) through per- colation process at room temperature. Hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing for 10 min (3× 300 mL). 0378-8741/$ – see front matter © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Chemical structures of compounds isolated from Vitex polygama n-butanolic extract. The resulting ﬁltrates were subsequently combined, evaporated in vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized. Afterward, the extract (31 g, 31%, w/w of the dry leaves weight (DLW)) was dissolved in distilled water and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using ethyl acetate (EA) and n-BuOH (BU) (5× 300 mL each) to yield EA (2.2 g, 2.2%, w/w DLW) and BU (10.7 g, 10.7%, w/w DLW) fractions, respectively. BU fraction was subjected to CC using XAD7 (46.0 cm × 4.0 cm) and subsequent elution with 500 mL of water (WV), water/MeOH 1:1 (WMV) and 2 L of MeOH (MV). One gram of the dried fraction MV (6.75 g, 6.75%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (53.0 cm × 3.0 cm) using MeOH as eluent resulting in 41 frac- tions of 30 mL, which were pooled into seven fractions (MV1 to MV7). Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg, 1.13%, w/w DLW) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with MeOH. Twenty-three fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven (MV4s to MV4z). Frac- tion 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg, 0.39% w/w DLW) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase MeOH, ﬂow-rate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield com- pounds 1 and 2 (5.5 mg, 0.04%, w/w DLW), substances 3 and 4 (3.1 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) after three cycles of 54 min. Frac- tion 5 (MV5, 293.1 mg, 1.98%, w/w DLW) was submitted to the same R-HPLC system to yield compounds 5 and 6 (20.5 mg, 0.14%, w/w DLW) as mixture, and compounds 7 and 8 (3.0 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) also as mixture. Fraction WV, after recrys- tallization in 90% aqueous MeOH solution, afforded substance 9 (280.0 mg). 5. Results From n-BuOH partition of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves from Vitex polygama were isolated the compounds caffeoyl 6- O--d-glucopyranoside (1), caffeoyl 6-O--d-glucopyranoside (2), schaftoside (3), isoschaftoside (4), orientin (5), isoorientin (6), carlinoside (7), isocarlinoside (8) and metacrylic acid (9) whose chemical structures (Fig. 1) were identiﬁed by means of 1H and 13C NMR as well as HMBC, HSQC and negative ESI/MS spectra data which were in accordance with previously reported data (Kitagawa, 1984; Besson et al., 1985; Dayrit et al., 1987; Shimomura et al., 1988). Schaftoside and its isomer is known for its efﬁcacy as anti-inﬂammatory (Melo et al., 2005) and preventive effect against kidney stone in rats, as evaluated by urine output, excretion of Ca, citric acid, and creatinine analysis (Kubo et al., 1989). Moreover the C-glycosidic ﬂavones 3, 4, 7 and 8 are being reported for the ﬁrst time in the genus Vitex.

INTRODUÇÃO O uso de plantas com propriedades inseticidas tem se mostrado uma promissora ferramenta no controle de insetos, por causar menor impacto ambiental, o que atende aos anseios da sociedade moderna.1 Dentre as espécies utilizadas como inseticida, o nim, Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae), é a popularmente mais conhe cida e cujo espectro de ação é bastante amplo, tendo seu efeito comprovado sobre aproximadamente 400 espécies de insetos.2 A partir dos excelentes resultados verificados com o nim, outras meliáceas também passaram a despertar o interesse de pesquisa dores, no intuito de encontrar novas espécies e novas moléculas com atividade inseticida. Várias espécies de Meliaceae se des tacam entre as famílias botânicas que apresentam ingredientes ativos com atividade inseticida, proporcionando eficiência de seus extratos.3 O gênero Trichilia é um deles, pois além de apresentar compostos com atividade inseticida conhecida (triquilinas),4 é bastante abundante nas regiões tropicais da América com mais de 230 espécies conhecidas.5 Mikolajczak e Reed6 realizaram um dos primeiros trabalhos testando a atividade inseticida de Trichilia sobre S. frugiperda. Os extratos etanólicos de T. pallida, T. connoroides, T. prieureana, T. roka e T. triphyllaria testados causaram mortalidade igual ou superior a 80% das lagartas, sendo que apenas a última espécie não afetou a sobrevivência do inseto. Diversos trabalhos comprovando a atividade inseticida de Trichilia ssp. sobre Spodoptera frugiperda têm sido rea lizados.1,7,8 A atividade biológica sobre insetos de alguns limonoides isolados de espécies de Trichilia vem sendo investigada, e resultados promissores foram encontrados.4,9-11 A espécie Trichilia elegans ssp. elegans A. Juss, conhecida popularmente como “Cachuá”, produz madeira resistente e durável, ocorre em matas semidecíduas e possui ampla dispersão no país, sendo encontrada desde Goiás até Santa Catarina, apresenta-se como uma árvore de 3 a 6 m de altura.12 Já a espécie Trichilia catigua A. Juss, são árvores com cerca de 10 m de altura e possuem flores de Matos et al. 1554 Quim. Nova As separações cromatográficas em colunas foram realizadas utilizando-se gel de sílica 60, 70-230, 230-400 mesh e Sephadex LH- 20. As separações por cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE) em condições preparativas foram realizadas em coluna Asahipak GS-310 2G (2,15 x 50,0 cm), utilizando equipamento Shimadzu LC- 8A com válvula de reciclo, injetor Rheodyne 7123 com loop 500 μL e detector UV/VIS Shimadzu SPD-6AV. As análises cromatográficas em camada fina foram realizadas em cromatoplacas de sílica gel F254 sobre placa de alumínio Merck, de 0,2 mm de espessura, empregando-se como revelador a solução de vanilina/ácido sulfúrico. Material vegetal Os frutos de T. elegans e T. catigua foram coletados em Piracica ba/SP no Campus da Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Quei roz” (Esalq/USP) e identificados pelo botânico Dr. Ricardo Ribeiro Rodriguez. Uma exsicata de T. elegans e outra de T. catigua foram depositadas sob os números 80407 e 7394, respectivamente. Preparação dos extratos Os frutos secos (84,0 g) e moídos de T. elegans foram extraídos à temperatura ambiente e em repouso, com solventes em ordem crescente de polaridade (hexano, MeOH e MeOH/água 1:1). As soluções obtidas foram concentradas por destilação do solvente em evaporador rotativo, fornecendo extratos hexânico, metanólico e hidrometanólico. Os frutos de T. catigua foram separados em arilo (3,5 g), semente (8,0 g) e exocarpo (3,0 g) e, posteriormente, secos e moídos. A extração das partes dos frutos de T. catigua foi reali zada utilizando as mesmas condições descritas para os frutos de T. elegans. Os extratos foram submetidos a ensaios biológicos sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho S. frugiperda e os que apresentaram atividade foram fracionados. Isolamento das substâncias de T. elegans O extrato hexânico dos frutos de T. elegans (4,20 g) foi submetido à cromatografia em coluna líquida a vácuo empacotada com sílica gel (230-400 mesh), utilizando-se como fases móveis solventes orgânicos de polaridade crescente: hexano; hexano/AcOEt 9:1; AcOEt e MeOH. Foram obtidas 4 frações após evaporação dos solventes orgânicos: FH1 = 20 mg; FH2 = 2800 mg; FH3 = 970 mg e FH4 = 245 mg. A fração FH3 foi submetida a vários fracionamentos em coluna de sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/ MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), em gradiente de polaridade crescente fornecendo as substâncias 1 (1,0 mg), 2 (1,0 mg), 3 (1,6 mg) e a mistura dos esteroides (8,0 mg). O extrato metanólico dos frutos de T. elegans (5,20 g) foi sus penso em uma mistura MeOH/H2O e particionado sucessivamente com CH2Cl2, AcOEt e n-BuOH. Foram obtidas 3 frações após evaporação dos solventes: FM1 = 1,40 g; FM2 = 0,30 g e FM3 = 3,5g. A fração FM1 foi fracionada em coluna sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com gradiente de CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/ MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), fornecendo após análise por CCDA, a substância 1 (1,6 mg). A fração FM2, após cromatografia em sílica gel (70-230 mesh) utilizando como eluente CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), originou 7 frações (FM2-1 a FM2-7). Da fração FM2-3 foram obtidas as substâncias 2 (10,9 mg) e 3 (3,9 mg), após cromatografia em sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com gradiente de CH2Cl2/MeOH. A fração FM2-4 foi fracionada em sílica gel (70-230 mesh) utilizando como eluente hexano/AcOEt/MeOH (hexano; hexano/AcOEt (10,0→100,0%); AcOEt/MeOH (10,0→100,0%), em polaridade crescente e, poste riormente, via CLAE preparativa (MeOH/CH2Cl2 7:3), fornecendo a substância 4 (3,00 mg). Isolamento das substâncias de T. catigua O extrato metanólico do arilo dos frutos de T. catigua (1,30 g) foi extraído sucessivamente com CH2Cl2 e MeOH. Foram obtidas 2 frações após evaporação dos solventes: FCM1 = 0,14 g; FCM2 = 0,98 g. A fração FCM1 foi submetida a vários fracionamentos em coluna de sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), em gradiente de polaridade crescente. Após esses fracionamentos, foi obtida a substância 5 (4,4 mg). A fração FCM2 foi fracionada em coluna de sephadex LH-20 eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH 1:1, fornecendo após análise por CCDA, as frações FCM2-1 a 6. A fração FCM2-4 foi submetida à purificação por cromatografia em sílica gel (70-230 mesh) tendo como eluente o gradiente CH2Cl2/ MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), fornecendo o limonoide 6 (1,0 mg). A fração FCMC-6 foi submetida ao mesmo processo de fracionamento cromatográfico e levou ao isolamento da mistura contendo 7 e 8 (3,6 mg). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO Ensaios biológicos realizados com extratos orgânicos de frutos de T. elegans e T. catigua sobre S. frugiperda mostraram que os extratos hexânico, metanólico e hidrometanólico de sementes de T. catigua provocaram mortalidades larvais moderadas (≅ 50,0 %) (Tabela 1). A mais alta taxa de mortalidade larval (100,0 %) foi obtida com os extratos hexânico e metanólico de frutos de T. elegans. Para os extratos hexânico e metanólico de frutos de T. elegans foi observada incapacidade das larvas para empuparem, que pode estar relacionada com variações hormonais nos insetos afetados, pois elas não conseguiram fazer a muda. Os mesmos resultados foram obtidos para larvas tratadas com azadiractina; além disso, azadiractina tem se mostrado capaz de interferir com a ecdíse.14 Em estudos anteriores, vários limonoides foram isolados dos frutos de T. elegans,13,15 mas suas atividades ainda não foram determinadas.

Constituintes químicos e atividade inseticida 1555 Vol. 32, No. 6 Os extratos hexânico e metanólico de frutos de T. elegans apre sentaram mortalidade similar ao extrato aquoso das sementes de Azadirachta indica sobre larvas de S. exempta, demonstrando ser um poderoso inseticida.14 Uma alta taxa de mortalidade representa uma das atividades inseticidas mais eficientes, já que atua logo nas primeiras fases da praga, diminuindo seu ataque na cultura e con tribuindo para o decréscimo das populações subsequentes. Assim, o estudo deste extrato é de suma importância, seja na sua forma bruta ou visando o isolamento de seus constituintes químicos. Ao se fracionar o extrato metanólico de frutos de T. elegans foram isoladas as cumarinas (1-3) e o limonoide (4), do extrato hexânico foram isoladas as mesmas cumarinas e os esteroides. Há na litera tura relatos de atividade antialimentar de furanocumarinas sobre S. exigua16 e S. litura.17 Apesar da baixa atividade inseticida do extrato metanólico do arilo de T. catigua (10%, Tabela 1) este foi fracionado e foi possível isolar os limonoides cedrelona (5), angolensato de metila (6) e a mistura epimérica de fotogedunina (7 e 8). O estudo químico do extrato hexânico dos frutos de T. elegans resultou no isolamento e identificação das cumarinas escoporona (1), escopoletina (2), umbeliferona (3) e na identificação da mistura dos esteroides: β-sitosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol e sitosteno na. As estruturas das cumarinas escoporona (1), escopoletina (2), umbeliferona (3) foram elucidadas com base nas análises dos dados de EM, RMN 1H 13C, além da comparação com dados publicados anteriormente.18 A mistura dos esteroides foi identificada através de análises por CG-EM, comparando-se os espectros de massas obtidos com os espectros existentes no banco de dados do equipamento, por RMN 1H e 13C e também por comparação com dados da literatura.19 O cromatograma de íons totais da análise por CG-EM apresentou 4 picos. O espectro de massas dos picos correspondentes apresentou íons moleculares em m/z 414, 412, 400 e 412, concordantes com os espectros de massas do sitosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol e sitostenona, respectivamente, sendo o esteroide sitosterol o composto majoritário desta mistura. A fração de T. elegans em AcOEt, resultante da parti ção do extrato metanólico dos frutos forneceu o limonoide 11β-acetoxiobacunona (4) cuja estrutura foi caracterizada atra vés de dados fornecidos pelo espectros de RMN 1H e 13C 1D e 2D (HSQC, HMBC, Tabela 2), envolvendo comparações com dados descritos na literatura13,20 para compostos com estruturas semelhantes ao limonoide (4). Esta é a primeira vez que os dados de RMN 1H e 13C do limonoide 11β-acetoxiobacunona (4) estão sendo apresentados. No espectro de RMN 1H da substância 4 fo ram observados sinais em δ 7,40-7,42 (m, H-21 e H-23) e δ 6,35 (s, H-22) ppm característicos do anel furano. As atribuições dos C-20 (δ 119,5), C-21 (δ 141,1), C-22 (δ 109,6) e C-23 (δ 143,3) do anel furano foram realizadas através de RMN 13C e confirmadas através do mapa de correlações HSQC e HMBC. O espectro de RMN 1H da substância 4 mostrou cinco singletos muito intensos com integração para três hidrogênios em: δ 1,08 (CH3-18), 1,45 (CH3-28), 1,50 (CH3-30), 1,53 (CH3-29), 1,60 (CH3-19) ppm referentes a grupos metila ligados a carbono sp3. Em δ 3,74 e δ 5,45 ppm observou-se a presença de dois sinais característicos do anel D δ-lactônico com epóxido entre C-14 e C-15, referente aos hidrogênios ligados aos C-15 e C-17, respectivamente. A pre sença de uma dupla ligação conjugada a um carbono carbonílico no anel A, foi determinada pela presença de dois dubletos em δ 6,01 (H-2, J = 12,1 Hz) e δ 6,55 (H-1, J = 12,1 Hz) atribuídos aos hidrogênios olefínicos e ao sinal em δ 166,4 referente ao carbo no carbonílico em C-3. O mapa de correlações HMBC permitiu confirmar a formação de um anel A ε-lactônico α-β insaturado, pois se observaram as correlações dos átomos de hidrogênio em δ 1,45 (s, CH3-28) e δ 1,53 (s, CH3-29) com os átomos de C-4 (δ 83,7) e C-5 (δ 56,6). Os sinais dos hidrogênios H-5, H-6α e H-6β foram atribuídos através das constantes de acoplamento observadas e do mapa de correlações HMBC e HSQC. O H-6α apresenta-se como tripleto largo ( 3,01, J = 14,2 Hz) devido ao acoplamento geminal com o hidrogênio H-6β e pseudo diaxial com H-5 (dd, 2,56, J = 14,2 e 4,6 Hz). Através de partições do extrato metanólico do arilo dos frutos de T. catigua, seguidas de fracionamentos cromatográficos, foram isola dos os limonoides 5-8. As estruturas dos limonoides cedrelona (5),21 angolensato de metila (6)22,23 e mistura epimérica de fotogedunina (7 e 8)24 foram elucidadas com base nas análises dos dados de RMN 1H e 13C 1D e 2D (Cosy, HSQC, HMBC), além de comparações com dados publicados anteriormente. Todos os limonoides isolados do extrato metanólico do arilo de T. catigua apresentam atividade inseticida relevante, no entanto, foi observada uma baixa mortalidade larval deste extrato (10%). Aparentemente esta baixa atividade está relacionada ao fato de se ter somente 1,46% de limonoides no extrato. Por outro lado, tem-se 9,80% de cedrelona (5) no extrato hexânico do arilo de T. catigua. Infelizmente, toda a massa deste extrato foi utilizada para o isolamento da cedrelona (5), deste modo não pôde ser ensaiado. Yajima et al.17 verificaram que a cumarina umbeliferona (3) apresentou atividade antialimentar sobre Spodoptera litura L. (Le pdoptera: Noctuidae) de 45 e 77% a uma concentração de 1000 e 100 ppm, respectivamente. Já o limonoide angolensato de metila (6) mostrou atividade antialimentar no método de disco de escolha convencional no terceiro instar larval de Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae) a 500 μg/mL.25 A mistura epimérica de fo togedunina (7 e 8) apresentou mortalidade larval de 95,83% a 25,0 ppm, ao ser incorporada à dieta artificial para Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae).26 Vários são os trabalhos descritos na literatura em que se demons tram as atividades inseticida e antialimentar do limonoide cedrelona (5) sobre diversas espécies de lepdópteras.27 AGRADECIMENTOS Ao CNPq, Capes e FAPESP pelas bolsas e apoios financeiros.

Introduction Chagas disease is one of the most widespread of tropical diseases, being endemic in 21 countries, with some 16–18 million individuals infected and a further 100 million peo- ple at risk (Molfetta et al., 2005; Pozas et al., 2005). Signiﬁcant antiprotozoal activities have recently been reported for a number of lignans derived from members of the Piperaceae family (Martins et al., 2003; Luize et al., 2006). This family, which is included among the basal angiosperms and can be found in the tropics mainly as pio- neer plants, has been the subject of numerous phytochem- ical investigations. The major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Par- mar et al., 1997; Benevides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Ale´cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (More- ira et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005). Piper and Peperomia represent the most important gen- era of the Piperaceae family with 2000 (Wanke et al., 2006) and 1700 species (Quijano-Abril et al., 2006), respectively. Species of Peperomia are well known as ornamental plants and have found application in folk medicine for the treat- ment of inﬂammation, asthma and gastric ulcers, and as analgesic and antibacterial agents (Arrigon-Blank et al., 2004). The major classes of compounds present in the rela- tively few species of Peperomia that have been investigated are prenylated phenols and benzoic acids (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Seeram et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998; Salazar et al., 2005), and also dibenzylbutyro- lactone and dibenzylbutanediol lignans (Li et al., 2006). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently, two new tetrahydrofuran lignans were isolated from Peper- omia pellucida (Xu et al., 2006) and thus a phenylpropa- noid-based lineage for the Peperomia species can be supported. Peperomia blanda H.B. & K. is a perennial herb that typ- ically grows in wet rock crevices (Guimara˜es and Giord- ano, 2004). At the present time, information is only available concerning the essential oil (Santos et al., 2001) and two chromenes isolated from the non-polar fraction of the aerial parts of the species (Velozo et al., 2006). In the present work, we report the isolation and structural elu- cidation of four new tetrahydrofuran lignan stereoisomers and a new tetrahydrofuran lignan of mixed biosynthetic origin. The antitripanosomal properties of these novel lign- ans have been determined. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract derived from aerial parts of P. blan- da was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 was fractionated chromatographically to yield ﬁve lignans 1–5; (Fig. 1) and two ﬂavones (6 and 7). The 1H NMR spectra of compounds 1–4 were characteristic of non-symmetric tetrahydrofuran lignans since each exhibited a pair of doublets at d 0.63 ± 0.05 (CH3-9) and 1.04 ± 0.04 (CH3-90) corresponding to methyl groups, a second set of doublets at d 5.03 ± 0.02 (H-7) and 4.32 ± 0.03 (H-70) that were assignable to oxybenzyl methine groups, and multiplets at d 2.18 ± 0.03 and 1.69 ± 0.03 associated, respectively, with the H8 and H80 protons. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data corroborated the presence of the tetrahydrofuran system in each case, and all signals were assigned accordingly based on HMBC data (Tables 1 and 2). As previously reported (Biftu and Stevenson, 1987; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989), the coupling constants of 8.5 and 9.0 Hz for the doublet at d 5.05, and of 4.33 Hz for H-7 and H-70 indicate that these hydrogens are in a trans conﬁguration with the adjacent H-8 and H-80 in a tetrahy- drofuran ring. Diﬀerential NOE experiments (Fig. 2) con- ﬁrmed the relative stereochemistry of all of the lignans isolated. Thus, as for lignan 3, H-7 showed clear NOE cor- relations with H-70 and H-8, H-70 correlated with H-7, H-8 and H-90, and H-80 correlated with H-9 conﬁrming the trans conﬁguration of the adjacent H-8 and H-80 and a cis conﬁguration between H-7 and H-70. The diﬀerences observed in the NMR spectra of com- pounds 1–4 were due to diﬀerent substitution patterns in the aromatic ring. The molecular formula of lignan 1 was established as C22H26O7 by HRMS. The aromatic moieties were determined to be syringyl and 5-methoxy-3,4-methy- lenedioxyphenyl groups on the following basis: (i) two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at d 6.49 (s, 2H) correlated to H7 in the HMBC spectrum, (ii) aromatic carbons C3 and C5 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.80) and to H2/H6, and (iii) the second aromatic ring was not symmet- rical and displayed two singlets at d 6.61 (H20) and 6.64 (H60), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-40 and C-70 in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, 1 was established as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-4-hydroxy-40,50-methylenedioxy-3,5,30- trimethoxy-7,70-epoxylignan. Compound 2 showed a molecular formula of C23H28O7 by HRMS. 1H NMR spectra indicated two equivalent aro- matic hydrogens at d 6.48 (s, 2H) correlating to H7 in the HMBC spectrum and aromatic carbons C3, C5 at d 152.8 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.77) and to H2/H6 and subsequently, C4 at d 136.6 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.76). The second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at d 6.61 (H20) and 6.64 (H60), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-40 and C-70 in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, 2 was identiﬁed as rel- (7R,8S,70S,80S)-40,50-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,30-tetrameth- oxy-7,70-epoxylignan, i.e., a methylated derivative of 1. The molecular formula of 3 was determined to be C23H30O7 by HRMS, and the aromatic moieties were iden- tiﬁed as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimeth- oxyphenyl groups. The aromatic singlets at d 6.49 and 6.67 were assigned to separate aromatic groups, since the HMBC showed correlation to H7 (d 5.03) and H70 (d 4.34), respectively. The remaining correlations between C3/C30, C4/C40 and C5/C50 perfectly matched those of H2/H20and H6/H60. Thus compound 3 was determined as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-40-hydroxy-3,4,5,30,50-pentameth- oxy-7,70-epoxylignan. Compound 4 showed the molecular formula C22H24O7 by HRMS, and both aromatic moieties were identiﬁed as 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups for the sig- nals at d 5.97 (s, 2H) and d 5.96 (s, 2H) due to methylenedi- oxyphenyl groups connected to C4/C5 and C40/C50, respectively. At d 3.93 (s, 3H) and d 3.90 (s, 3H) are the res- onances of two methoxyl groups correlated to C3 and C30.

Tetrahydrofuran lignans isolated from the aerial parts of Peper- omia blanda. 446 L.G. Felippe et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 445–450 The identity of 4 was thus established as rel- (7R,8S,70S,80S)-4,5,40,50-dimethylenedioxy-3,30-dimethoxy- 7,70-epoxylignan. The molecular formula of 5 was established as C23H28O8 by HRMS. The compound diﬀered from lignans 1–4 in respect to a hydroxyl group linked to C-9. The presence of this group was deduced from various sources: the IR spectrum (absorption at 3450 cm1), from the 1H NMR by signals at d 3.40 (2H, m), from the 13C NMR both from resonances at d 62.5 and the presence of only one methyl group (d 1.08; d, J = 7.0 Hz), and from the HMBC, which showed connectivity between the H9 protons and C7. Thus, 5 was determined as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-9-hydroxy- 40,50-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,30-tetramethoxy-7,70- epoxylignan. The known ﬂavones 5-hydroxy-40,7,8-trimethoxyﬂavone (6) and 5-hydroxy-30,40,7,8-tetramethoxyﬂavone (7) were also identiﬁed in the extract derived from the aerial parts of P. blanda. These compounds have been previously iso- lated from Peperomia sui (Cheng et al., 2003). Compounds 1–5 were submitted to bioassay against epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y and the respective IC50 values are shown in Table 3. All of the lign- ans exhibited potent trypanocidal activity.

Concluding remarks In this work, we describe the isolation and structural elucidation of ﬁve new tetrahydrofuran lignans from the aerial part of P. blanda. The trypanocidal activity of these compounds was evaluated against epimastigotes of T. cruzi strain Y. All of the isolates showed potent activity when compared with the positive control benznidazole. 3. Experimental 3.1. General 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HREIMS were measured using a Bruker Daltronics model ultrO- TOFQ ESI-TOF instrument. HPLC separations were per- formed on a Varian PrepStar model SD-1 LC/UV/VIS chromatograph equipped with a Supelcosil C-18 reversed phase column (250 · 21.2 mm; Supelco). IR spectra were measured in KBr pellets in a Perkin–Elmer Infrared spec- trometer FTIR series 1600. Optical rotations were mea- sured at k = 589 nm in a digital polarimeter JASCO model DIP-370. UV spectra were recorded in MeOH using a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer. Separations by CC were carried out using silica gel (230–400 mesh; Merck). All sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 3.2. Plant material The aerial parts of P. blanda were collected at the Res- erva da Ripasa, Ibate´ – SP, Brazil in January of 2005 and identiﬁed by Dra. Elsie Franklin Guimara˜es. A vou- cher specimen (Kato-547) has been deposited at the Her- barium of the Instituto de Biocieˆncias, Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo – SP, Brazil. 3.3. Isolation of compounds Dried aerial parts (86 g) of P. blanda were milled, extracted with EtOAc (1.2 L) for 4 hours at room temper- ature, and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude extract (8.5 g). This extract was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 (1.95 g) was submitted to CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane–EtOAc to yield fractions 1-14. The precipitate pres- ent in fraction 3 (420 mg) was puriﬁed by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound 6 (6.3 mg), whilst the soluble part was submitted to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane–EtOAc producing subfractions 3-1 to 3- 60. Subfractions 3-20 (12 mg) and 3-43 (46 mg) aﬀorded compounds 4 and 2, respectively. Fraction 4 (220 mg) was submitted to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gra- dient of hexane–EtOAc providing subfractions 4-1 to 4-37. Subfraction 4-23 (98 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (72:28) to aﬀord compound 1 (8.6 mg). The precipitate present in fraction 6 (103 mg) was puriﬁed by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield com- pound 7 (8.0 mg). Fraction 7 (350 mg) was subjected to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane– EtOAc resulting in subfractions 7-1 to 7-167. Subfraction 7-140 aﬀorded compound 5 (7 mg). Subfraction 7-79 (95.0 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (2:3) to yield ﬁve fractions, the penultimate of which aﬀorded compound 3 (17 mg). 3.4. rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-4-Hydroxy-40,50-methylenedioxy- 3,5,30-trimethoxy-7,70-epoxylignan (1) Pale yellow oil, ½a21 D 52.8 (MeOH; c 0.125).

In vitro bioassays The biological assays with epimastigote forms of T. cru- zi strain Y were performed as described previously (Ber- nacchi et al., 2002). Tetrahydrofuran lignans and benznidazole (Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were stored as 1.0 mg ml1 stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and were serially diluted (1:3) prior to use with liver-infusion tryptose (LIT) medium to provide concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 lg ml1, each in triplicate. The number of viable pro- tozoa was determined by counting in a Neubauer chamber after 72 h incubation at 28 C. The 50% inhibitory concen- tration (IC50) values were calculated by ﬁtting a nonlinear regression curve (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) and comparing with those of benznidazole, the positive control. A one-way ANOVA test was used to establish the signiﬁcance level of the activity corresponding to each compound evaluated in the in vitro assay.

Introduction The Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families are rich sources of quinonemethide triterpenes (Br€uning and Wagner, 1978; Gunatilaka, 1996), and these compounds have a variety of biological activities such as antitumor (Bhatnagar et al., 1979; Goncalves de Lima et al., 1971), antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971); antibi- otic (Goncalves de Lima et al., 1969; Gonzalez et al., 1977); cytotoxic (Setzer et al., 1998) and antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989; Figueiredo et al., 1998) proper- ties. Systematic studies on Celastraceae and Hippo- crateaceae plant species (Corsino et al., 1998a,b,c, 2000, 2003; Buﬀa Filho et al., 2002) have been concerned with biosynthesis of quinonemethide triterpenes, the main secondary metabolites in this taxon. The biosynthetic study dealing on Maytenus aquifolium (Celastraceae) and Salacia campestris (Hippocrateaceae) indicated that friedelane triterpenes are putative precursors of qui- nonemethide triterpenes, which are biosynthesized in the leaves and translocated to the root bark, where these compounds would be transformed into quinonemethide triterpenes (Corsino et al., 2000). These ﬁndings have led us to investigate other species of Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae. Cheiloclinium cognatum (Miers) A.C. Sm. (Hippocrateaceae) a tree widely distributed in the Cerrado region of Brazil, was selected to investigate the oxidative transformation on the E ring of the quinon- emethide triterpenes. With this objective, we carried out a chemical study on this plant species, which led to the isolation of two new triterpenes, 22b-hydroxypristimerin (1) and cognatine (2), besides seven known quinon- emethide triterpenes; pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5), 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6), netzahualcoyonol (7), netzahualcoyondiol (8) and net- zahualcoyone (9). The free radical scavenging activities of the isolates have been evaluated through a spectro- photometric assay using the stable free radical 2,2-di- phenyl-picryl hydrazyl(DPPH). * Corresponding author.

Results and discussion A CH2Cl2 soluble fraction obtained from the ethan- olic extract of the root bark C. cognatum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further puriﬁed by preparative TLC and/ or HPLC, aﬀording compounds 1–9. 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1), obtained as a red amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C30H40O5 by analysis of its ESI/MS spectrum, elemental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 3450 cm1 (hydroxyl group) and 1724 and 1645 cm1 (carbonyl groups). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of six methyl singlets at d 2.13, 1.38, 1.22, 1.15, 0.99 and 0.41, attributed to H3-23, H3-25, H3-26, H3-30, H3-28 and H3-27, respectively, (Table 1). The quinon- emethide moiety was characterized by a doublet at d 6.26 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz), a singlet at d 6.41 (1H) and a doublet at d 6.94 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz) attributed to H-7, H-1 and H-6, respectively. The singlet at d 2.13, char- acteristic of a methyl group attached to a sp2 carbon (H3-23), corroborated the presence of a quinonemethide system. Further oxygenated functional groups were as- sumed to be hydroxyl and ester on the basis of NMR spectral analysis. The 13C NMR, gHMBC and gHMQC spectra (Table 2) showed the presence of 30 carbons in 1. In the 13C NMR spectrum two carbonyl carbon signals (d 178.2 and d 178.3) attributed to C-29 and C-2, re- spectively, six methyl carbons (d 38.1, 32.2, 24.0, 21.6, 19.0 and 10.1), six methylene carbons (d 38.1, 36.1, 33.5, 30.8, 29.5 and 28.2), four methine carbons (d 134.0, 119.5, 118.0 and 46.1), 10 quaternary carbons (d 169.7, 164.6, 146.0, 127.3, 117.2, 44.5, 42.6, 42.4, 39.2 and 38.2), one methoxyl carbon (d 51.6) and one hydroxy- methine carbon (d 67.9) were observed. The assignments were based on gHMQC and gHMBC spectra and by comparison with published data on pristimerin (Guna- tilaka, 1989, 1996). The correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum from the singlet at d 0.99 (H3-28) to the hydroxymethine carbon at d 67.9 (Fig. 1) and the signals at d 36.1 (C-16), 38.1 (C-17) and 46.1 (C-18), conﬁrmed the attachment of the hydroxyl group at C- 22. The relative stereochemistry of H-22 was deduced by the coupling constant values (d 4.02, J22ax=21ax ¼ 11:0 Hz and J22ax=21eq ¼ 4:0 Hz), which corroborated the equa- torial orientation of the hydroxyl group. The ester group was conﬁrmed by a singlet at d 3.50 (3H) attributed to a methoxyl portion of the ester group at C-29, which was conﬁrmed by means of correlation of the methyl group at d 1.15 (C-30) with the carbonyl carbon of the ester group at d 178.2 (C-29) observed in the gHMBC spec- trum (Fig. 1). The structure of 1 was determined as 22b- hydroxypristimerin. Cognatine (2), isolated as a pale yellow amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C31H38O7 by means of analysis of ESI/MS data, ele- mental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl group at 3438 cm1 and carbonyl groups at 1718 and 1643 cm1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of two singlets at d 6.85 (1H), attributed to H-1 and at d 6.00 (1H) assigned to H-7. Also, two methoxyl groups signals at d 3.73 and 3.74 (3H, each) were ob- served, which were characterized as methoxyl groups attached to C-3 and belonging to the ester group at C- Table 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1 and 2 [500 MHz, d (ppm), multiplicity, J (Hz), CDC13] Position 1 2 1 6.41 (s) 6.85 (s) 6 6.94 (d, J6;7 ¼ 6; 5 Hz) – 7 6.26 (d, J7;6 ¼ 6; 5 Hz) 6.00 (s) 21 – 4.95 (s) 22 4.02 (dd, J22ax;21ax ¼ 11:0 Hz and J22ax;21eq ¼ 4:0 Hz) – 23 2.13 (s) 2.67 (s) 25 1.38 (s) 1.33 (s) 26 1.22 (s) 1.72 (s) 27 0.41 (s) 0.90 (s) 28 0.99 (s) 1.38 (s) 30 1.15 (s) 0.95 (s) OCH3 at C-29 3.50 (s) 3.74 (s) OCH3 at C-3 – 3.73 (s) 1978 A.H.

Other singlets integrating for 3H each were observed at d 2.67, assigned to a methyl group on aro- matic ring (H3-23), at d 1.72 assigned to one methyl group on double bond (C-26) and at d 1.38, 1.33, 0.95 and 0.90, corresponding to tertiary methyl groups (H3- 28, H3-25, H3-30 and H3-27, respectively). The analysis of the 13C NMR (Table 2), gHMQC and gHMBC spectral data indicated the presence of three carbonyl carbons at d 214.0, 185.8 and 175.2 attributed to C-22, C-6 and C-29, respectively, six methyl groups at d 27.6, 23.9, 22.5, 21.7, 15.1 and 13.7, attributed to C-25, C-27, C-28, C-26, C-23 and C-30, respectively, two vinylic carbons at d 134.7 and 125.9, two vinylic carbons conjugated to carbonyl groups at d 160.1 and 129.3, four methylene carbons at d 38.0, 37.1, 35.8 and 34.2, one methine carbon at d 46.2, ﬁve quaternary aromatic carbons at d 151.7, 151.2, 144.7, 134.0 and 122.4.

Jeller et al. / Phytochemistry 65 (2004) 1977–1982 1979 nals for four quaternary carbons (d 42.2, 40.7, 48.8 and 50.3), two sp3 carbons belonging to methoxyl groups (d 52.7 and 61.7) and one hydroxymethine carbon at d 74.3 were also observed. The gHMBC data (Fig. 2) showed the correlation of the singlet at d 6.85 (H-l) to the carbons at d 151.7 (C-2), d 144.7 (C-3), d 122.4 (C-5) and d 42.2 (C-9) and the singlet at d 6.00 (H-7) to the carbons at d 134.7 (C-4), d 122.4 (C-5) and d 42.2 (C-9) corroborating unambigu- ously the assignments of H-l and H-7. Besides, the signal at d 6.85 (1H, H-l) was correlated to d 110.1 (C-l) and the signal at d 6.00 (1H, H-7) showed correlation to d 129.3 (C-7) in the HMQC spectrum. The correlation between the methoxy signal at d 3.73 and the carbon signal at d 144.7 conﬁrmed the position of the methoxyl group at C-3. Also, the gHMBC spectrum showed cor- relations from the signal at d 1.22 (H3-26) to signals at d 125.9 and d 134.7, assigned to carbons C-14 and C-15, respectively. The signal at d 1.38 (H3-28) showed cor- relations with the carbon signal at d 38.0 (C-16) and also with the carbonyl signal at d 214.0, which conﬁrmed the position of one carbonyl group at C-22. An additional correlation from the methyl signal at d 1.72 (H3-26) to the carbon at d 38.0 (C-16) corroborated the attribution of the other carbonyl at C-6, with the chemical shift at d 185.6 being characteristic of an a,b-unsaturated car- bonyl and C-16, a methylenic carbon. The remaining gHMBC correlations from H3-30 (d 0.95) to C-19 (d 34.2) and the hydroxymethine carbon at C-21 (d 74.3), besides correlation of methoxyl hydrogens at d 3.74 with the carbonyl signal at C-29 (d 175.2), established the proposed structure 2 for cognatine. The known compounds pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5) and 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6) were identiﬁed by comparison with published data (Gunatilaka, 1989; Gunatilaka, 1996; Dhanabalasing- ham et al., 1996; Furlan et al., 1990). Compounds 7–9 had been previously isolated from Orthosphenia mexi- cana (Gonzalez et al., 1983), but a number of incon- sistencies were found regarding the assignments of published 13C NMR data. The analysis of 2D NMR spectra allowed accurate assignment of 13C NMR signals mostly based on gHMQC and gHMBC experiments. The spectrophotometric assay using DPPH indicated a prominent free radical scavenging activity for some of the isolated quinonemethide triterpenes (Fig. 3). The stable free radical DPPH has an absorption maximum at 517 nm, which decreases upon reduction through reaction with an antioxidant compound. The free radical scavenging activity of quinonemethide triterpenes is mostly due to the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety with extended conjugation through ring B, e.g. in compounds 1 and 3–6 or B–D, e.g. in compounds 7–9. These fea- tures stabilize the quinonemethide free radical promptly formed after loss of one radical hydrogen, donated to the DPPH. The more extended conjugations of triter- penes 7–9 account for their higher free radical scav- enging abilities (ca. 45% inhibition at 60 lM) when compared to compounds 1–6 (less than 30% inhibition at 60 lM). The phenolic triterpene 2 exhibited the lowest activity (18% at 60 lM) probably due to the lack of conjugation through rings B–D. The free radical scav- enging ability of the quinonemethide triterpenes and a standard compound rutin (66% inhibition at 60 lM) are due to catechol moiety present in the B ring of rutin the C2–C3 double bond (van Acker et al., 1996). The syn- thetic antioxidant BHT (11% inhibition at 60 lM) ex- hibited the weakest antiradical activity as expected due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH (Bondet et al., 1997). 3. Experimental 3.1. Plant material Root barks of C. cognatum (Hippocrateaceae) were collected at Universidade Federal de Goias, Goi^ania, GO and identiﬁed by Dr Julio Ant^onio Lombardi (Departamento de Bot^anica do Institute de Ci^encias Biol^ogicas – Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG). A voucher specimen (No. 19797) is deposited at Herbarium of Institute de Ci^encias Biol^ogicas – UFG, Goias. 3.2. Instrumentation and chromatography Silica gel (Merck, 230–400 and 70–230 mesh) were used for CC unless otherwise stated and solvents were distilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were re- corded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HPLC separations were performed using a Shimadzu LC-10AS. Preparative HPLC separation were performed on a Varian PROSTAR, using a reversed phase column (Phenomenex-Luna C18, 21.2 250 mm, 0 20 40 60 80 100 5 10 20 40 80 100 concentration (µM) (Ao-A)/Ao (%) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 rutin BHT Fig. 3.

ESI-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin–Elmer. 3.3. Extraction and isolation of constituents Dried and powdered root barks of C. cognatum (690.0 g) were extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to aﬀord a brown gum (210.6 g), which was submitted to liquid– liquid partitioning. The CH2C12 soluble part of the EtOH extract was concentrated in vacuo (25.5 g), sub- mitted to a silica gel column (600 g, 70–230 mesh) eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient, yielding 41 fractions (A1–A41). Fraction A9–A11 (1.48 g) was submitted to a ﬂash silica gel CC (230–400 mesh), eluted with a hexane/ EtOAc gradient resulting in 32 fractions (B1–B41). Fraction B10–B14 (0.154 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] yielding compound 3 (55 mg). Fraction B18–B21 (0.085 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] aﬀording compound 4 (34 mg). Fraction A16–A17 (3.55 g) was submitted to ﬂash silica gel CC (70–230 mesh), eluted with hexane/EtOAc gra- dient, resulting in 46 fractions (C1–C46). Fraction C19– C23 (0.221 g) was submitted to a reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 ml min1] to aﬀord compounds 1 (63 mg) and 8 (65 mg). Fraction A22–A26 (2.46 g) was subjected to a ﬂash silica gel CC eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 77 fractions (D1–D77). Fraction D23–D27 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0.05%] aﬀording compounds 5 (13 mg) and 6 (23 mg). Fraction D17–D22 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0,05%, three elutions] and further puriﬁed by reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 mL min1] aﬀording compounds 7 (18 mg) and 2 (4 mg). 3.4. Radical scavenging activity on DPPH radical Radical scavenging activity was assayed according to the Blois method (Blois, 1958). The free radical scav- enging capacities of quinonemethide triterpenes and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated based on their ability to reduce the free radical already assigned (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubi- lized in methanol (10 ml) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 to 100 lM were then prepared in MeOH and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated (see Fig. 3). 3.5. 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1) Amorphous solid.

Casearin X degraded to the corresponding dialdehyde when stored in CDCl3. The diterpenes isolated were cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines, with caseargrewiin F being the most active and the new clerodane, casearin X, the second active compound with IC50 values comparable to the positive control doxorubicin. All isolated diterpenes showed lower activities against normal human cells than against cancer cell lines, which might indicate a possible selective action on cancer cells. Casearin X dialdehyde was not cytotoxic to cancer cells indicating that the occurrence of these CO groups at C(18) and C(19) is incompatible with the cytotoxic activity. Introduction. – Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae), commonly known as guaÅatonga, is widely distributed in the form of a shrub or tree throughout South America, but especially within the Atlantic and Amazon forests and the Cerrado biomes of Brazil [1]. The plant is of considerable scientific interest by virtue of its extensive use in popular and traditional medicine for the treatment of snake bites and in wound healing, and also as an anti-ulcer, anti-pyretic, and topical antiseptic [2][3]. Pharmacological studies on leaf extracts of C. sylvestris have confirmed anti- ulcerogenic [4][5], anti-inflammatory [6], antivenom [7][8], and cytotoxic activities [9][10]. Additionally, no significant toxicological effects have been observed following oral administration of EtOH extracts of C. sylvestris leaves to animals [4], and no genotoxicity was detected when such extracts were assayed against hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) and lung fibroblast V-79 cells [11]. Phytochemical investigations of various species of Casearia have revealed the presence of a series of oxygenated tricyclic cis-clerodane diterpenes in which the tetrahydrofuran ring bears two acyloxy groups at C(18) and C(19) [12–21]. Such compounds are reportedly unstable under acidic conditions and readily degrade to form the corresponding dialdehyde [16]. The casearins A–T, isolated from the leaves CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 205 2010 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zrich of C. sylvestris, represent a group of diterpenes of this type that are cytotoxic to V-79 cells in transgenic Chinese hamsters, 180A sarcoma cells implanted into rats, and mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [9][10][17]. A number of related diterpenes, the casearvestrins A–C, have been isolated from the leaves and branches of C. sylvestris and found to exhibit anti-fungal activity against Aspergillus niger and cytotoxicity against human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cell lines [18], whilst the roots of the same plant contain a similar type of diterpene with trypanosomicidal properties [19]. Moreover, less complex clerodane diterpenes, such as (þ)-15-hydroxy- 3-cleroden-2-one and ()-hardwickiic acid [20], have been identified in the leaves of C. sylvestris. These compounds differ from the casearins with respect to the pattern of oxygenation and also in the configuration of the A/B ring junction, and between the Me(17) and Me(20) groups. It thus appears that C. sylvestris can biosynthesize both cis- and trans-clerodane diterpenoids, a characteristic that is common to various other species including Adelanthus lindenbergianus (Adelhantaceae) and Grangea mader- aspatana (Asteraceae) [22][23]. In the present article, we report on the isolation of five casearins (including the new casearin X (1)) and of caseargrewiin F (6) from the EtOH extracts of the leaves of C. sylvestris, and on the formation of the degradation product of casearin X, 7. The structures of the compounds were determined from spectrometric data and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. The cytotoxicities of these compounds against human cancer and normal cell lines are also reported. Results and Discussion. – Isolation and Structure Determination. Fractionation of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. sylvestris by solid-phase extraction (SPE) from silica gel/activated charcoal, followed by normal-phase low pressure column chroma- tography (LPCC) over silica gel and preparative reversed-phase (C18) HPLC, allowed the purification of a new clerodane diterpene (1) together with the known compounds 2–6 [9][10][21]. CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 206 1) Arbitrary numbering. For systematic names, see Exper. Part. Compound 1, obtained as a white powder, was submitted to high-resolution time-of- flight-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-TOF-ESI-MS) in the positive- ion mode and exhibited [MþNa]þ and [MþK]þ ions with masses 555.2931 and 571.2659, respectively, that were consistent with the values 555.2928 and 571.2668, respectively, calculated on the basis of an empirical formula of C30H44O8 for the molecular ion. The 13C-NMR of 1 presented 30 signals that were similar to those reported for other casearins [9][10][17][20]. A broad band in the IR at 3490 cm1, together with 13C- and 1H-NMR signals at d(C) 72.9 (C(6)1)) and d(H) 4.16 (dd, J¼ 11.0, 5.0; HC(6)), respectively, indicated the presence of a HOCH group in the molecule. Similarly, an IR absorbance at 1752 cm1 and 13C signals at d(C) 170.0, 173.3, and 173.4 suggested the presence of one AcO and two butanoate ester groups, respectively (Table 1). The absorption band at 235 nm in the UV spectrum is characteristic of a conjugated diene in the side chain of the casearins [9][10][17][20], the presence of which was confirmed from signals observed in the olefinic region of the 1H-NMR showing cis/trans coupling of the CH2 H-atoms of a terminal monosubstituted C¼C bond (d(H) 5.11 (d, J¼11.0, HaC(15)1)), 5.24 (d, J¼17.0, HbC(15))) with the vicinal H-atom (d(H) 6.79 (dd, J¼17.0, 11.0, HC(14))), and a signal at d(H) 5.62 (d, J¼9.0, HC(12)) which could be attributed to the H-atom attached to a trisubstituted C¼C bond of a conjugated diene. The partial structure formed by the side chain linked at C(9) was confirmed from the observed HMBC correlations between HC(11) and C(12), HC(12) and C(13)/C(16), HC(14) and C(16), HC(15) and C(13), and Me(16) and C(13), together with the COSY correlations shown in the Figure. The (Z)- configuration of the C¼C bond at C(12) was determined on the basis of the nuclear Overhauser (NOESY) effect observed between Me(16) and HC(12). The signals of the O-bearing CH groups at d(C) 97.3 (C(18)) and 99.2 (C(19)), and of the two H-atoms at d(H) 7.14 (s, HC(19)) and 7.43 (t, J¼1.5, HC(18)) indicated the existence of a diacetal system in the C ring. Moreover, HMBCs (Figure) between HC(18) and the CO group of one butanoate group (d(C) 173.4), and between Figure. Selected HMBC and COSY correlations observed for 11) CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 207 HC(19) and the CO group of an AcO group (d(C) 170.0) defined the positions of these substituents. The second butanoate group was attached to the C-atom displaying a signal at d(C) 67.4 (C(2)). The relative configurations at the eight stereogenic centers were determined from 13C-NMR spectral data, 1H-NMR coupling constants, and the results of NOE and NOESY experiments. The cis-configuration of the A/B ring junction was deduced from the chemical shift (d(C) 25.5) of the Me(20) group in accordance with previous reports [15][24][25]. The chemical shifts of C(5) and C(10) (d(C) 54.8 and 37.7, resp.) were similar to those described for the casearins and analogous compounds [9][10][26]. Moreover, the values of the coupling constants (J¼3.5 and 13.5 Hz) of the doublet of doublets at d(H) 2.74 suggested that HC(10) was in axial orientation.

Overhauser (NOESY) effects between HC(10) and HC(12), and HC(11) and HC(19), indicated a similar orientation for the side chain at C(9). In general, cis-clerodane diterpenes that are not substituted at positions C(7), C(8), C(10), C(11), and C(12) exhibit chemical shifts around d(C) 15.0 and 26.0 for the Me(17) and Me(20) groups, respectively, in the trans configuration [13][26–28], and values of ca. d(C) 16.0 and 18.0, respectively, for Me(17) and Me(20) groups in the cis configuration [20][21][28–30]. Casearins substituted at C(7) present chemical shifts for the Me(17) and Me(20) groups of ca. d(C) 11.0 and 26.0, respectively, which are most likely caused by the g shielding effect of the O-bearing substituent at C(7) [9][10]. Casearvestrins are not substituted at C(7), which explains the chemical shift value of d(C) 15.6 reported for C(17) [18]. In the case of 1, which has no substituent at C(7), the signals at d(C) 16.1 and 25.5 (associated with the Me(17) and Me(20) groups, resp.) indicate a trans relationship between Me(17) and Me(20). The chemical shift of d(C) 67.4 for the O-bearing HC(2) group, and the coupling constant observed for the allylic H-atom HC(2) (d(H) 5.71, t, J¼4.5), are consistent with a b-pseudo-equatorial orientation of HC(2) [13][19][26]. Furthermore, the observed nuclear Overhauser (NOESY) effects between HC(2) and HbC(1) (d(H) 2.10–2.14 (m)), and HC(6) and HbC(1), suggest that these H-atoms possess the same b-orientation. The 1,2-diaxial coupling of HC(6) with CH2(7), implied by the value of the coupling constant (11.0 Hz) for HC(6), confirms the a-equatorial position of the OH group. The observed homoallylic coupling (5J) between HC(18) (d(H) 7.43 (t, J¼1.5)) and HC(2) requires that the p-orbitals of the C¼C bond overlap with the 1s orbitals of the H-atoms thus implying a b-orientation for HC(18) [12]. Finally, the nuclear Overhauser effect between HC(18) and HC(19) confirms the a-orientation of the butanoate group at C(18) and the AcO group at C(19). The 13C-NMR data (recorded in (D5)pyridine) for 2 (C31H44O10), 3 (C30H44O9), 4 (C29H42O9), 5 (C33H48O10), and 6 (C28H40O8) were comparable with those previously determined in CDCl3 [9][10][21]. Additional spectral data (UV, IR, HR-MS, 1H-NMR, HMQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY) confirmed the structures of these compounds. Formation and Structure Elucidation of Casearin X Dialdehyde 7. Some authors have reported, on the basis of NMR experiments, that clerodane diterpenes similar to the casearins are unstable in CHCl3 and undergo opening of the diacetal ring with the formation of an 18,19-dialdehyde [16][18]. In this context, the caseamembrins F, J, and K isolated from C. membranaceae which are considered to be natural products [14][26], are most likely artefacts generated by the use of CHCl3. In the present study, the NMR spectra of 1 measured in CDCl3 presented signals of two aldehydic H-atoms replacing the H-atoms of the diacetal ring. When the stability over a period of one month of 1 dissolved in five different deuterated solvents (i.e. CDCl3, (D6)DMSO, (D6)acetone, CD3OD, and (D5)pyridine) was studied, degradation was detected only in CDCl3. It is probable that the formation of 7 from 1 was promoted by traces of acid present in CDCl3 [16], and for this reason all further NMR experiments were conducted with (D5)pyridine as solvent. Compound 7, obtained as a white powder, exhibited an [MþH]þ ion in the positive-ion mode HR-TOF-ESI-MS with a mass of 403.2484 that was consistent with the value of 403.2484 calculated on the basis of an empirical formula of C24H34O5 for CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 209 the molecular ion. The difference in the molecular formulae of 1 and 7 was consistent with the loss of a butanoate and an AcO group and the formation of a dialdehyde at positions 18 and 191). The 13C-NMR data (including DEPT-135) of the dialdehyde recorded in CDCl3 were similar to those of 1 measured in (D5)pyridine, except of the signals of the diacetal C-atoms at C(18) and C(19) which were substituted by signals associated with aldehydic CO groups with signals at d(C) 195.7 (d) and 202.6 (d), respectively. Similar differences were observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum in which the signals associated with HC(18) and HC(19) appeared in the aldehydic region, i.e., d(H) 9.92 (d, J¼2.0) and 9.38 (s), respectively. The structure and relative configuration of 7 was determined on the basis of data derived from 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments (1H, 13C, DEPT-135 and -90, HMQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY) in a manner similar to that described above for casearin X. Compound 7 is an isomer of caseanigrescens D-2, a degradation product of caseanegrescens D from C. Nigrescens [16], and the two aldehydes differ only with respect to the position of the conjugated diene in the side chain, being D12,14 in the former and D13(16),14 in the latter. Cytotoxicity against Tumor Cell Lines. The isolated compounds 1–7 were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against the four human tumor cell lines MOLT-4 (leukaemia), MDA-MB-435 (melanoma), HCT-8 (colon), and SF-295 (glyoblastoma), and against L-929 (normal fibroblasts). The IC50 values displayed in Table 2 reveal that 6 was the most active of the compounds tested, showing stronger cytotoxicity against all tumor cell lines (IC50<0.2 mm) compared to normal L-929 cells (IC50¼1.09 mm). These values are quite similar to those obtained to the positive control doxorubicin, that presented IC50 values ranging from 0.02 to 0.83 mm to tumor cells, and 1.2 mm to L-929 cells. Considering the selectivity towards tumor cells, compound 6 was 12.1 times more active against MOLT-4 cells than against L-929, while doxorubicin was 24 times. However, if it was considered for example breast and glyoblastoma cells, while doxorubicin was only 1.4 and 3.0 times more active in tumor cells, 6 was 8.4 and 6.4 times more active, respectively. In the previous evaluation of cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines, compound 6 was inactive against KB cells (oral epidermoid carcinoma), showed significant cytotoxicity against BC1 cells (human breast cancer) and minor activity against NCI-H187 cells (human small cell lung cancer) [21]. Further studies are necessary to establish the selectivity profile for this compound. Whilst 1 is not as cytotoxic as 6, it exhibited a good anti-proliferative potential against tumor cells (IC50< 1 mm). Compounds 2–5 displayed only moderate cytotoxicities, although it is worth noting that, in every case, cytotoxicity against normal cells was lower than that against tumor cells, indicating a possible selective action on cancer cells. Compound 7, on the other hand, was ineffective against most of the tumor lines. Additionally, none of the compounds tested caused haemolysis even at the highest concentration (200 mg/ml), suggesting that the mechanism of cytotoxicity is probably related to a more specific pathway. Cytotoxic activities against human tumor cell lines have been studied for other clerodane diterpene 18,19-dialdehydes obtained from species of Casearia. Thus, caseamembrin F was found to be cytotoxic to PC-3 (prostate cancer) cells but not to Hep3B (hepatoma) cells [26]. Moreover, the caseamembrins J and K exhibited no cytotoxicity against KB (oral epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (cervical epithelial CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 210 CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY – Vol. 7 (2010) 211 Table 2.

It would appear, therefore, that the presence of the dialdehyde function in these clerodane diterpenes results in the total or partial loss of cytotoxicity indicating that the occurrence of the CO groups at positions 18 and 19 is incompatible with the cytotoxic activity. In addition, the lack of an AcO group at C(6) and the lack of an O-bearing function at C(7) in the strongest active compounds (casearin X and caseargrewiin F) agree with the discussion of SAR in previous reports [10][14]. In conclusion, caseargrewiin F and the new compound casearin X showed relevant cytotoxic activity against the leukemia, melanoma, colon, and glyoblastoma cancer cell lines, comparable with the positive control doxorubicin. In addition, the lower activities of these compounds against normal human cells can be indicative of a selective action on cancer cells.

Dried and powdered leaves of C. sylvestris (20.5 kg) were extracted with EtOH (ca. 200 l) in a stainless steel extractor with solvent re-circulation for ca. 24 h at 408. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 1540.0 g of dry residue. A portion (473.6 g) of the residue was separated by SPE from SiO2 (60–200 mm, Merck)/activated charcoal (Synth) (1:1, w/w) by elution with hexane/AcOEt (95 :5, v/v), AcOEt, and MeOH to afford three fractions (SPE1–SPE3). SPE2 (16.0 g) was submitted to normal-phase LPCC over SiO2 (40–63 mm; Merck) eluted with a gradient of hexane/AcOEt/iPrOH of increasing polarity (78 :20.5 :1.5 to 60 :37.3 :2.7, v/v/v): 45 fractions were collected and monitored by TLC, anal. HPLC-UV, and NMR.

Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxic potential of the isolated compounds and doxorubicin was evaluated by the MTT assay [31] against five cell lines (MOLT-4, MDA-MB-435, HCT-8, SF-295, and L- 929) obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 U/ml penincillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, at 378 with 5% CO2. Tumor cell growth was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.7105 cells/ well for adherent cells and 0.3105 cells/well for suspended cells) and the compounds (0.019–25 mg/ml) were added to each well. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT 0.5 mg/ml. After 3 h, the plates were centrifuged, and the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 ml DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin was used as pos. control. Statistical Analysis. The IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA), from three independent experiments. Haemolytic Assay. The isolated compounds were assayed for haemolytic activity at concentrations in the range 1.56–200 mg/ml according to the method of Moreira et al. [32]. Analytes were incubated in 96- well plates for 60 min at r.t. with suspensions of mouse erythrocytes (2%) in NaCl (0.85%) containing 10 mm CaCl2. Following centrifugation, the levels of haemoglobin in the supernatants were determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm.

In the present work, we determined the cytotoxic effect of casearin L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (−)- hardwickiic acid isolated from Casearia sylvestris leaves, and investigated the underlying mechanisms involved in in vitro cell death induced by Cas X in HL-60 leukemia cells (0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M). Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that Cas X was the most active compound studied, showing greater cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 lines (IC50 of 0.4 M) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, IC50 of 1.2 M). After 24 h exposure, Cas X caused a decrease in 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorpo- ration (36.6 and 24.5% labeling at 0.7 and 1.5 M, respectively), reduction in viability, and increase in apoptotic and necrotic leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner evidenced by the trypan blue and AO/EB (acridine orange/ethidium bromide) assays. Moreover, Cas X-treated cells exhibited nuclear frag- mentation and cytoplasmic vacuolization depending on the concentration tested. These characteristics of apoptosis or secondary necrosis were conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry which revealed DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, activation of the effector caspases 3/7 and mitochondrial depolar- ization. We then found evidence that Cas X causes cell death via apoptotic pathways, corroborating the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction Cancer is a pathological consequence with multifactorial causes such as mutations in speciﬁc genes (proto-oncogenes/tumor sup- pressors) or post-translational modiﬁcations of proteins, where key events can increase cancer risk and lead to uncontrolled prolifera- tion [1]. Chemotherapy remains the most important line of defense for patients with hematological malignancies and aggressive forms of solid tumors. However, drug toxicity and efﬁcacy vary widely among these patients [2]. Many drugs normally kill cancer cells by inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, two forms of cell death with distinct morphological and biochemical features [3–5]. In this sce- nario, plant compounds have made valuable contributions to the discovery of new naturally occurring anticancer agents, especially those from tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world [6]. ∗Corresponding author.

Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae), a medicinal tree that grows practically throughout the entire Brazilian territory from Amazonas State (Tapajós River region) to Rio Grande do Sul State [7,8], is popularly known as “guac¸ atonga,” “cafezinho-do-mato,” “café-Silvestre” and “erva-de-bugre.” Its leaves are used for treat- ing traumas, for skin and oral wound healing and as a topical anesthetic and antiseptic [7,9]. In vitro and pre-clinical stud- ies have highlighted its anti-inﬂammatory [10–12], antimicrobial [13–15], antiplasmodial [16], and anti-ulcer [11,17,18] proper- ties. Phytochemical investigations of C. sylvestris leaf extracts have led to the discovery of bioactive clerodanes, the casearins and casearvestrins, which are oxygenated tricyclic diterpenes with excellent cytotoxic and antitumor potential [14,19,20–22]. Despite their well-known antiproliferative actions, there are no studies showing how these diterpenes cause cell death, although Huang et al. [23] have suggested that clerodane diterpenes isolated from Casearia membranacea induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells (human prostate tumor line). 0009-2797/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ferreira et al. / Chemico-Biological Interactions 188 (2010) 497–504 In this work, we determined the cytotoxic activity of clerodane diterpenes [casearins L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (−)- hardwickiic acid isolated from C. sylvestris leaves and investigated the cytotoxic effects of Cas X on HL-60 leukemia cells and the under- lying mechanisms involved in its in vitro cytotoxic action. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Plant material and structure determination Leaves of C. sylvestris were collected at the Parque Estadual Car- los Botelho (São Miguel Arcanjo, São Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium ‘Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann’ (Instituto Botânico do Estado de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identiﬁed by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto Botânico do Estado de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of C. sylvestris were extracted with ethanol in a stainless steel extractor with solvent reﬂux for ca. 24 h at 40 ◦C. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) and dried in desiccators over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield a dry residue. The structure of the compounds casearins L, O, X and (−)- hardwickiic acid was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in Santos et al. [21] and Santos et al. [22]. 2.2. Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines The cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes [(Cas L, Cas O, Cas X and (−)-hardwickiic acid)] was evaluated by the MTT assay [24] against 3 human leukemia cell lines: HL-60, K-562 and CEM, all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supple- mented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin, at 37 ◦C with 5% CO2. By an indirect way, tumor cell proliferation was quantiﬁed through the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2- thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product [24]. Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 96-well plates and diterpenes (0.01–10 M) were added to wells. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium con- taining MTT 10%. Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 L DMSO and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX 880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin (Dox, Sigma Aldrich) was used as a positive control (0.02–8.6 M). To avoid false proliferation data, the experiments were per- formed in triplicate and the proliferation rate was always compared to negative controls. In all replicates, similar inhibition rates and cell proliferation in negative control wells were higher than in the treated wells. 2.3. Alamar Blue assay In order to investigate the selectivity of Cas X for normal prolif- erating cells, the Alamar BlueTM assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug expo- sure. All studies were performed in accordance with Brazilian research guidelines (Law 196/96, National Council of Health). Heparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug for at least 15 days prior to sampling, aged between 18 and 30 years old) was collected, and PBMC were iso- lated by a standard method of density-gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concen- tration of 3 × 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin at 37 ◦C with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (4%) was added at the beginning of culture, according to Caval- canti et al. [25] with some modiﬁcations. PBMC were then plated in 96-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well in 100 L of medium). After 24 h, the test compound (0.01–10 M) dissolved in 1% DMSO was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for another 72 h. Dox (0.02–8.6 M) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incubation, 10 L of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma Aldrich Co) were added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter®), and the drug effect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of control absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of medium only is also measured at the higher and lower wavelengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is sub- tracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOLW. A correction factor R0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOLW, where R0 = AOLW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced is then expressed as follows: % Reduced = ALW −(AHW × R0) × 100. 2.4. Evaluation of mechanism involved in leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity The following experiments were performed in order to investi- gate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect of Cas X. The doses were chosen based on IC50 values of Cas X in HL-60 cells after 24-h exposure. Cas X dissolved in sterile DMSO was added to HL- 60 cell cultures (0.3 × 106 cells/mL) to obtain ﬁnal concentrations of 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M (IC50/2, IC50 and 2 × IC50, respectively). Dox, 0.6 M, was used as a positive control. 2.4.1. Trypan blue exclusion Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay [26]. Aliquots from each well were removed from cultures after 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber. 2.4.2. Inhibition of DNA synthesis HL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with Cas X. Before the end of drug expo- sure, 20 L of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) were added to each well and the cells incubated for another 3 h at 37 ◦C. To determine the amount of BrdU incorporated into DNA, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature [27]. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and coverslipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was performed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per slide to deter- mine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. 2.4.3. Staining with hematoxylin-eosin Untreated or Cas X-treated HL-60 cells were examined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metrimpex Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar Lab®). To evaluate morphol- ogy, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, ﬁxed with methanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E, Sigma Aldrich Co. – St. Louis, MO/USA). P.M.P. Ferreira et al. / Chemico-Biological Interactions 188 (2010) 497–504 499 2.4.4. Morphological analysis using ﬂuorescence microscopy Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining of HL-60 cells was performed to determine the cell death pattern induced by increasing concentrations of Cas X. Although AO and EB are DNA intercalating molecules, the ﬁrst is able to cross intact membranes and confers green appearance to the nucleus of viable cells. On the other hand, EB is incorporated mainly by non-viable cells or in the presence of membrane instability, staining nucleus in red [28]. So, after 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted, and each sample was mixed with 1 L of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 g/mL of AO in PBS; 100 g/mL EB in PBS) just prior to ﬂuorescence microscopy analysis and quantiﬁcation (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hun- dred cells were counted per sample and scored as follows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells [29]. 2.4.5. Flow cytometry analysis All ﬂow cytometry analyses were performed in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cell debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.4.5.1. Cell membrane integrity. Cell membrane integrity was eval- uated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 g/mL, Sigma Aldrich Co. – St. Louis, MO/USA). Brieﬂy, 100 L of treated and untreated cells were incubated with propidium iodide (50 g/mL). The cells were then incubated for 5 min. Fluorescence was mea- sured and cell morphology, granularity and membrane integrity were determined [30]. 2.4.5.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was evaluated by the incorporation of pro- pidium iodide (50 g/mL). Brieﬂy, HL-60 cells were treated and then incubated at 25 ◦C for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 g/mL propidium iodide. Fluorescence was measured and DNA fragmentation was analyzed [31]. 2.4.5.3. Measurement of mitocondrial transmembrane potential. Mitochondrial depolarization was evaluated by incorporation of rhodamine 123 (Sigma Aldrich Co. – St. Louis, MO/USA). Rhodamine 123 is a cell-permeable, cationic, ﬂuorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria without inducing cytotoxic effects. Brieﬂy, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 L of 1 g/mL rhodamine 123 for 15 min in the dark. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 L in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Fluorescence was measured and percentage mitochondrial depolarization was determined [29]. 2.4.5.4. Phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. PS externalization was demonstrated by ﬂow cytometry after PS staining with annexin V according to the method described by Vermes et al. [32]. Brieﬂy, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in 135 L of PBS with 5 L of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and 10 L of annexin V-PE (Guava Nexin Assay Kit). The cells were gently vortexed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (20–25 ◦C) in the dark. Afterward, the cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (EasyCyte from Guava Technologies). Annexin V is a phospholipid-binding protein that has a high afﬁnity for PS. 7- AAD, a cell impermeant dye, is used as an indicator of membrane structural integrity. Fluorescence of annexin V-PE was measured at 583 nm (yellow ﬂuorescence) and 7-AAD at 680 nm (red ﬂu- orescence). The percentages of early and late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells were then calculated. 2.4.5.5. Detection of caspases 3 and 7. Caspase 3/7 activity was esti- mated by ﬂow cytometry, using the Guava EasyCyte Caspase Kit, after 24 h of incubation. HL-60 cells (3 × 105 cells/mL) were incu- bated with Fluorescent Labeled Inhibitor of Caspases (FLICA) and maintained for 1 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2. After incubation, 80 L of washing buffer were added and cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 L of wash- ing buffer and centrifuged again. The cells were then resuspended in the working solution (propidium iodide 1:200 in 1× washing buffer) and analyzed immediately by ﬂow cytometry. 2.5. Statistical analysis For cytotoxicity studies, the IC50 values and their 95% conﬁdence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Graph- pad program (Intuitive Software for Science,San Diego, CA).Inorder to determine differences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman–Keuls test (p < 0.01). 3. Results 3.1. Cytotoxicity against tumor and normal cells Cytotoxicity analyses by MTT after 72 h of incubation displayed that Cas X was the most active clerodane diterpene (Table 1), showing higher cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 cells with IC50 values of 0.4 M for both cell lines. Interestingly, K-562 cells were more resistant to Cas X, displaying an IC50 of 9 M. On the other hand, casearins L and O were moderately cytotoxic while (−)-hardwickiic acid was ineffective in inhibiting cell prolifera- tion. PBMC assay showed IC50 values of 1.2 (1.0–1.4) M and 1.5 (1.1–2.0) M for Cas X and Dox, respectively. All following experiments were performed with HL-60 cells to investigate the mechanism of action of Cas X. 3.2. Cell viability, DNA synthesis and morphological changes HL-60 cells treated with Cas X had signiﬁcantly reduced cell via- bility and increased number of non-viable cells (p < 0.01), showing a dose-dependent effect after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1A). Aiming to understand the antiproliferative effect of Cas X, BrdU incorporation into the DNA was measured. All experiments were performed in three concentrations (0.7, 1.5 and 3 M), but the highest one did not allow a conﬁdent cell analysis after treatment, Table 1 Cytotoxicity activity of clerodane diterpenes on human leukemia cell lines after 72 h of exposure evaluated by MTT assay.

As seen in Fig. 1B, Cas X led to decreasing BrdU incor- poration, with 36.6 and 24.5% labeling in relation to control at 0.7 and 1.5 M, respectively (p < 0.01), while Dox (0.6 M) led to 26.5% BrdU labeling. To establish whether the growth inhibition displayed by Cas X was related to the induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/EB staining by ﬂuorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment, there was a reduction in the number of viable cells in a dose-dependent manner, while apop- totic and necrotic cells increased (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was observed at the lower doses of 0.7 and 1.5 M (82 and 88.1%, respec- tively), while at the highest dose, 3.0 M, necrosis was the main cell death pattern (77.7%). Treated and untreated cells were examined under light microscopy following H/E staining. Control cells exhibited a typ- ical non-adherent, round morphology with vacuolization (Fig. 2A), while Cas X-treated cells displayed a gradual chromatin conden- sation and fragmentation, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, cell shrinking and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C–E), especially at 1.5 M (Fig. 2E). Dox (0.6 M) induced a reduction in cell volume, along wtih nuclear disintegration and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). 3.3. Mechanism of action underlying Cas X cytotoxicity – ﬂow cytometry analysis 3.3.1. Membrane disruption Cas X induced plasma membrane disruption in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01, Fig. 3A), whereas at 1.5 M (5.8%) and 3.0 M, 24.6% of the cells showed membrane lysis when compared to untreated cells (1.4%). Doxorubicin, positive control, also caused membrane disruption (7.4%). 3.3.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation results are presented in Fig. 3B. Results were obtained by DNA size, and sub-diploid pat- tern was considered fragmented. DNA fragmentation (p < 0.01) was observed in all concentrations tested in a dose-dependent manner, with 14. 5, 61.9 and 80.5% for cells treated with Cas X at 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M, respectively, when compared to control (1.4%). 3.3.3. Mitochondrial depolarization Mitochondrial depolarization is a feature of apoptosis. HL-60 treated cells (Fig. 3C) showed mitochondrial depolarization at all concentrations tested: 23.2, 68.8 and 21.8%, for 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M, respectively. It is important to note that at the highest concentra- tion (3.0 M) a false mitochondrial repolarization occurred, which can be explained by severe cell destruction [33]. 3.3.4. Caspase 3/7 activation Caspase 3/7 activation was found with all concentrations tested (Fig. 3D). Early apoptotic cells were observed with 3.0 M Cas X (17.3%). Meanwhile, an increase in late apoptosis (13.3, 27.7 and 10.8%) and necrosis (6.4, 6.9 and 6.1%) was observed in cells treated with 1.5 M and 3.0 M Cas X and Dox, respectively (p < 0.01). No differences were observed at the lowest concentration of Cas X (0.7 M). 3.3.5. Phosphatidylserine externalization Phosphatidylserine (PS) detection is a hallmark of apoptosis; PS resides on the surface of the plasma membrane, where cell damage leads to its externalization [32]. Cells treated with Cas X at all concentrations displayed PS externalization (p < 0.01, Fig. 4). The number of early apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner [10.1, 18.4 and 38.4% for cells treated with Cas X at 0.7 (Fig. 4C), 1.5 (Fig. 4D) and 3.0 M (Fig. 4E), respectively]. Mean- while, late apoptosis was more frequent at 1.5 and 3.0 M (17.8 and 39.6%, respectively). 4. Discussion Drug discovery from medicinal plants has played an impor- tant role in cancer chemotherapy. Of all the available anticancer drugs between 1940 and 2002, 40% were natural products per se or natural product-derived [34,35]. Nevertheless, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, either because of undesired side effects or multi-drug resistance [2]. Therefore, it is very important to ﬁnd new compounds with antineoplastic activity with more speciﬁcity against cancer cells and thus fewer side effects. In this way, Casearia species have a wide range of biological activities [11,24,36,37] that make it a probable source of new active compounds with anticancer properties. In the present work, the cytotoxic effect of the clerodane diterpenes (−)-hardwickiic acid and casearins L, O and X isolated P.M.P.

Magniﬁcation, ×400. from C. sylvestris leaves was determined in three leukemia lines (CEM, HL-60 and K-562). Also, the cytotoxicity of Cas X was investi- gated in normal PBM proliferating cells. The underlying mechanism of action of Cas X was further evaluated using the HL-60 cell line as a model [33,38]. MTT assays showed that all compounds tested were active against at least one cell line, where Cas X was the most active against HL-60 and CEM cell lines. PBMC were also sensitive to Cas X but 3-fold less than the leukemia cells. Only (−)-hardwickiic acid showed no cytotoxicity against the leukemia cell lines. Several authors have demonstrated that clerodane diterpenes, secondary metabolites present in Casearia species, are cytotoxic to differ- ent tumor cell lines, such as colon (HCT-116), leukemia (HL-60), ovarian (A2780), prostate (PC-3), and normal ﬁbroblasts (L-929, V-79) [14,22,37,39–41]. More recently, we demonstrated the cyto- toxic capacity of the Cas X against leukemia (MOLT-4, IC50 value of 0.22 M), melanoma (MDA/MB-435, 0.35 M), nervous system (SF-295, 0. 43 M), and colon (HCT-8, 0.97 M) cancer cells [22]. Concerning chemotherapeutic potential, it is important to deter- mine if the compound shows harmful effects in normal dividing cells such as proliferating leukocytes [42]. Herein, the data insinu- ate a narrow selectivity of Cas X towards cancer cells, though we previously showed that Cas X was up to 12-fold more selective against adherent cancer lines when compared to normal ﬁbroblasts [22]. Structural comparison of known casearins revealed that the main differences in activity involve substitutions at C-2, C-6, C- 7, C-18 and C-19. Replacement of the acyl group at C-6 markedly decreases activity of the derivatives, indicating that the bulkiness at that site is important for biological activity [20]. Cytotoxic effects of casearin L, O and X seem to depend on the ring structure formed by carbons C-18 and C-19, since acid hydrolysis and opening of this ring leads to molecular instability and loss of bioactivity [37] as seen with (−)-hardwickiic acid, which does not inhibit cell pro- liferation (Fig. 5). Moreover, (−)-hardwickiic acid was one of the ﬁrst diterpenes reported in C. sylvestris without the typical highly oxygenated backbone [21]. Many of the clerodanes that are highly oxygenated exhibit effective insect antifeedant, antibacterial, cyto- toxic and antifungal properties [14,41,43]. The antiproliferative effects of Cas X in leukemia cells were con- ﬁrmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, BrdU incorporation and ﬂow cytometry. Furthermore, morphological analysis using HE and AO/BE staining after 24 h of incubation revealed that treated cells displayed typical apoptotic and necrotic features, including signs 502 P.M.P.

In fact, Cas X-treated cells displayed apoptotic features concentrations as low as 0.7 M with an increase in necrotic cells at 3.0 M, probably as a result of a later apoptosis stage. Generally, apoptotic cells simultaneously show membrane integrity and high rates of DNA fragmentation [5].

Structure of casearins L (1), O (2) and X (3) and (−)-hardwickiic acid (4) isolated from leaves of Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae). used to measure plasma membrane integrity and to discriminate between primary and secondary necrosis. Also, a critical stage of apoptosis involves the acquisition of surface changes by dying cells, which trigger their speciﬁc recognition and removal by phagocytes, where the latter could eventually prevent potential tissue injury resulting from cell lysis in situ [44]. This cell engulfment is signaled by externalization of PS, a phospholipid predominantly observed on the inner surface facing the cytosol [32]. If apoptosis is acti- vated, PS on the external leaﬂet of the lipid bilayer can be detected using annexin V, a 35-kDa Ca2+-binding protein, with high afﬁn- ity for PS. The lower dose effects observed after Cas X treatment were membrane integrity, mitochondrial depolarization, DNA frag- mentation and PS externalization, all features of apoptosis. As a nuclear feature of apoptosis, the internucleosomal fragmentation of double-stranded DNA is attributed to caspases, cysteine aspartate- speciﬁc proteases synthesized as zymogens that cleave different proteins, such as caspase-3, the major effector caspase that pre- dominantly disintegrates laminin and nuclear mitotic apparatus proteins [45]. With increasing concentration of Cas X, necrosis fea- tures such as loss of membrane integrity, loss of mitochondrial depolarization, and caspase 3/7 highly activated were observed after Cas X treatment. These data conﬁrm those obtained with mor- phological approaches (trypan blue exclusion and AO/EB and H&E staining) in which dose-dependent effects were observed, sugges- tive of secondary necrosis or late apoptosis. Secondary necrosis occurs when apoptotic cells cannot maintain ATP production or control oxidative stress [46]. Dose-dependent regulation of cellular processes is one of the most important characteristics of signaling molecules naturally occurring in cells. Therefore, depending on the concentration used, many different processes may be inﬂuenced and/or altered [47]. The data pre- sented here are at odds with a previous work by Carvalho et al. [13] who demonstrated that casearins G, S and T displayed DNA damage via acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants. Our ﬁndings are also in agreement with those of Huang et al. [23] who discovered that caseamembrins A-F, clerodane diterpenes isolated from C. membranacea leaves, are able to activate caspase-8 and -9 in PC-3 cells. In conclusion, the data presented in this work demonstrate that casearins L, O and X have a strong cytotoxic effect on leukemia cell lines, while (−)-hardwickiic acid does not, which is probably related to the highly oxygenated backbone present in the casearins and absent in (−)-hardwickiic acid. Also, we provide strong evidence that Cas X exerts its cytotoxic effect through induction of apop- tosis, which emphasizes the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties and as interesting lead molecules for the design of new anticancer drugs.

NFB regulates the expression of several genes involved in carcinogenesis. These include anti-apoptotic, cytokines and cell cycle-regulatory genes. It is well established that the transcriptional factor NFB is deregulated in many forms of cancer. Thus, agents that can suppress NFB activation have the potential of suppressing carcinogenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from Alchornea glandulosa (Euphorbiaceae) and eight esters were synthesised. These compounds were evaluated against TNF--induced NFB activation with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Gallates with IC50 values in a range of 10–56 mM mediated inhibitory activity higher than gallic acid (IC50 76.0 4.9 mM). In addition to inhibiting NFB activation, gallic acid mediated a modest cytotoxic effect, and some of the gallates affected cell viability at the tested concentrations. Based on these results, suppression of NFB activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis. Keywords: gallic acid; NFB pathway; cytotoxicity; 293/NFB cells; Alchornea glandulosa; cancer chemoprevention 1. Introduction Phenolic acids are natural products which possess a wide spectrum of biological activity (Nazaruk, Czechowska, Markiewicz, & Borawska, 2008). yBoth authors contributed equally to this paper. *Corresponding author.

Nihei & A. Nihei, 2004). It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as salts and esters. Some ointments used to treat psoriasis and external hemorrhoids contain gallic acid (Garcı´a de Hombre & Pe´ rez Pen˜ ate, 2006; Hatton, 2000). Gallic acid has two major functional groups, hydroxyls and a carboxylic acid, which can yield numerous esters and salt derivatives. Some galloyl compounds are used as antioxidants in food and can exhibit important roles in prevention of inflammatory and atherosclerosis responses by blocking activation of NFB (Murase et al., 1999). NFB consists of homo and heterodimeric protein complexes acting as a transcription factor, and is found in many animal cell types. It is involved in regulation of immune response and inflammation, cell lineage development, cell apoptosis, cell-cycle progression and oncogenesis due to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidised LDL and microbial antigens, and has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, cIAP, survivin, TRAF, COX-2, MMP-9, iNOS and cell cycle-regulatory components, whose products are involved in tumourigenesis (Aggarwal, Sethi, Nair, & Ichikawa, 2006; Chen, Castranova, & Shi, 2001; Melisi & Chiao, 2007; Thanos & Maniatis, 1995). Most carcinogens, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, or tumour promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, H2O2, have been shown to activate NFB, and resulting tumours have misregulated NFB activity (Baldwin, 2001). It is now well established that aberrant regulation of NFB, and the signalling pathways that control its activity, are involved in cancer development and progression, as well as in drug resistance, especially during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Inoue, Gohda, Akiyama, & Semba, 2007). Blocking NFB can cause tumour cells to stop proliferating, undergo apoptosis, or to become more sensitive to the action of antitumour agents (Frydrych & Mlejnek, 2008; Yamamoto & Gaynor, 2001). Thus, agents that can suppress NFB activation have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis or tumourigenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from Alchornea glandulosa Poepp and Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), and eight semi-synthetic esters were prepared. All the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity as well as potential to inhibit TNF--induced NFB activation with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. 2.

Alkyl alcohols and DCC were purchased from Aldrich. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and sulphorho- damine B (SRB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), antibiotic–antimycotic, hygro- mycin B, and MEM sodium pyruvate were purchased from Invitrogen Co. (Carlsbad, CA). Reporter Lysis Buffer, Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison). Tumour Necrosis Factor- (TNF-) was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Alcohol was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). 2.2. Isolation of gallic acid The leaves of A. glandulosa were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac¸ u, Sa˜ o Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen (SP319257) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜ o Paulo-SP, Brazil). The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L 3) at room temperature and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrup residue, which was diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and then successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the partition phases yielded 2.5 g and 0.8 g, respectively. The part of EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford 11 fractions (A1–A11). Fraction A2 (730 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : HOAc (7.5 : 92 : 0.5), UV detection at 265 nm; flow rate 15 mL min1] to give compound 1 (335 mg). Compound 1 was identified as gallic acid based on analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR data, as well as by comparison with authentic material in our laboratory (Figure 1).

Synthesis of esters 2–9 After being cooled at 5C, the mixture of gallic acid (0.2 mmol) and alcohol (20 mmol) in p-dioxane (6.0 mL) was added to a solution of N,N0-dicyclohexylcar- bodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane (3.0 mL). The solution was stirred for 48 h, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned three times with EtOAc and then filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (three times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (three times), water (two times), dried over MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column using an isocratic system of CHCl3–MeOH (98 : 2) to give gallate esters 2–8. Structures of the semi- synthetic esters, methyl gallate (2), ethyl gallate (3), n-propyl gallate (4), isopropyl gallate (5), n-butyl gallate (6), isobutyl gallate (7), n-pentyl gallate (8) and 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid (9), were established by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis (Figure 1). For synthesis of ester 9, gallic acid (20 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (5.0 mL) and anhydride acetic (5.0 mL) under hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, carried to dryness under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography with a mixture of CHCl3–MeOH (85 : 15) to give a product (9). The NMR spectroscopic data of 9 were compatible with 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid. 2.4. NFjB luciferase assay NFB inhibition assay was conducted using a luciferase reporter gene bioassay as previously described (Homhual et al., 2006). Human embryonic kidney cells (293/ NFB-Luc) were used to monitor alteration of the NFB pathway. This cell line is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct regulated by the NFB response element. Transcription factor can bind to the response element when stimulated by TNF-, allowing transcription of the luciferase gene. Luciferase reacts with substrate, emitting light that was detected using a luminometer. Cells were seeded (105 cells mL1) on sterile white walled 96-well plates and grown to approximately 80% confluence by incubating for 48 h. Gallic acid and alkyl gallates were tested at 20 mg mL1 following 1 : 3 serial dilutions. After treatment with tested compounds for 10 min, cells were incubated for an additional 6 h with or without TNF- (5 ng mL1). The cells were gently washed with PBS and kept at 80C with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corporation). The luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay system from Promega following manufacturer instructions. Luciferase activity was monitored (LUMIstar Galaxy BMG), dose-response curves were constructed, and results were expressed as IC50 values (i.e. concentration required to inhibit TNF- induced NFB activity by 50%). 2.5. Cytotoxicity assay Cytotoxicity was determined by the method of Skehan et al. (1990). The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and stained for 30 min with 0.4% (w/v) sulphorho- damine B (SRB) prepared in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM Tris base Natural Product Research 1761 Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014 [tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader. 2.6. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences between means were located using Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Differences between means at the 5% (p 5 0.05) level were considered significant. The data are expressed as means standard error. 3. Results and discussion Herein we report cytotoxic properties and suppression of TNF- induced NFB activation of gallic acid (1) and eight esters (2–9) determined with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Table 1 shows the concentrations of gallates 1–9 required to inhibit NFB-induced activation in 50% (IC50). N-Tosyl- L-phenylalaninyl-chlormethylketone (TPCK) was adopted as positive control, exhibiting 98.5% 0.5% NFB inhibition at 30 mM, with an IC50 value of about 5 mM. At the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg mL1), gallic acid mediated a moderate cytotoxic effect (52.9% 3.5% survival), but none of the gallate esters significantly affected cell viability. The most cytotoxic compound evaluated was 6, with 48.9% 3.3% cell survival. Among inhibitors of NFB, salicylates, aspirin (Kopp & Ghosh, 1994), apigenin and curcumin (Gerritsen et al., 1995; Singh & Aggarwal, 1996) were reported to suppress activation of NFB by preventing the degradation of the NFB inhibitor (IB), and therefore NFB was retained in the cytosol. The serine protease inhibitor TPCK can cause a complete block to NFB activation. TPCK inhibits NFB subunits processing and IB degradation (Mellitis, Hay, & Goodbourn, 1993). It has also been demonstrated that TPCK inhibits DNA replication by G0–G1 growth arrest and thus promotes apoptosis by other cytotoxic stimuli (Kirillova, Chaisson, & Fausto, 1999). Table 1.

Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014 The present study provides evidence that some gallates can act as inhibitors of NFB. Methyl gallate (2) demonstrated the greatest activity. The inhibitory actions of gallates do not appear to result from non-specific cellular toxicity but rather are specific for NFB-dependent gene transcription. In another study, it has been demonstrated that gallates can inhibit TNF--induced nuclear translocation of NFB by way of a mechanism independent of IB degradation (Murase et al., 1999). More recently, prevention of atherosclerosis, cancer, anti-plasmodial and antioxidant activity of a group of galloyl compounds was described, as well as structure-activity relationships yielding cytotoxic properties (Fiuza et al., 2004; Jagan, Ramakrishnan, Anandakumar, Kamaraj, & Devaki, 2008; Locatelli et al., 2008; Murase et al., 1999; Na et al., 2006; Petroˆ nio et al., 2007; Saxena et al., 2008). Based on these encouraging intracellular responses, we suggest suppression of NFB activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis, and further investigations related to the actions of gallates, especially in NFB signaling pathway and in vivo models, may provide new insights into the cancer chemopreventive ability.

Extração ácido-base de uma nova porção do extrato bruto etanólico permitiu a identificação do alcalóide liriodenina. Os derivados fenilpropanoídicos e o alcalóide N-acetilnonaina estão sendo descritos pela primeira vez no gênero Michelia. O alcalóide liriodenina e a lignana siringaresinol apresentaram atividade antifúngica moderada. Palavras-chave: Magnoliaceae; Michelia champaca; alcalóides; atividade antifúngica. Introdução Magnoliaceae compreende cerca de 10 gêneros e 220 espécies, sendo que a maioria ocorre no Hemisfério Norte, mas também são encontrados na Ásia (Índia e Malásia) e América do Sul (Brasil). No Brasil são cultivadas várias espécies dos gêneros Magnolia e Michelia, popularmente conhecidas como magnólia amarela [1]. A espécie Michelia champaca aparece como uma planta importante na medicina indígena [2]. É usada pela população para regular a menstruação, combater infecções da garganta e febres, artrites, reumatismos [3], como anticoncepcional [2] e como proteção pós- parto [4]. Estudo farmacológico com o extrato da casca da raiz indicou propriedade inseticida potente contra a larva do mosquito Aedes egyptii [5]. Estudos fitoquímico e biológico com raízes [6], cascas da raiz [7] e folhas [6] de M. champaca levaram ao isolamento de lactonas sesquiterpênicas com significativa atividade antitumoral e permitiram estabelecer o perfil químico deste gênero como essencialmente terpênico [5], com predominância das lactonas sesquiterpênicas. KHAN e colaboradores [4] relatam, com base em triagem fitoquímica, a presença de alcalóides, flavonóides, taninos, saponinas, além de triterpenóides em folhas, sementes, caules e raízes de M. champaca. O flavonóide quercetina foi isolado das flores, pela primeira vez no gênero por KAPOOR e JAGGI [8]. Além da atividade antitumoral descrita anteriormente, alguns autores relatam também atividade antifúngica para a espécie. O extrato metanólico das flores 13 Ecl. Quím., São Paulo, 32(3): 13-18, 2007 de M. champaca mostrou forte atividade frente ao patógeno Staphylococcus aureus [9]. Os extratos diclorometânico e metanólico das folhas apresentaram atividade moderada frente a vários fungos patogênicos e fitopatogênicos [10]. Ainda, sementes, caules e raízes foram bioativos quando ensaiados com fungos patogênicos humanos [4]. Neste trabalho, descrevemos o fracionamento biomonitorado dos caules de M. champaca, buscando isolar e identificar os possíveis metabólitos secundários responsáveis pela atividade antifúngica detectada na fase diclorometânica quando bioensaiadas com os fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. Materiais e Métodos Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em espectrômetro Varian AS 500 (500 MHz para 1H e 125 MHz para 13C). Foram utilizados os solventes deuterados CDCl3, DMSO-d6 e CD3OD, produzidos pela Acros, Aldrich ou CIL, sendo TMS o padrão interno. As colunas cromatográficas tiveram como fase estacionária sílica gel 60 H (70 – 230 mesh, Merck) e sílica C18 (43 – 60 μm). As análises em cromatografia em camada delgada foram realizadas em sílica gel 60 F254 (placa) e as manchas visualizadas por absorção da radiação UV, anisaldeído 2% em H2SO4 seguida de aquecimento, câmara de iodo e solução dragendorff. Os cromatogramas foram obtidos por Cromatografia Líquida de Alta Eficiência (CLAE), num aparelho Varian ProStar, com detector UV-Vis, registrados em microcomputador de 500 MHz com processador Pentium II. Foram utilizadas colunas analíticas Phenomenex Luna C18 (5 ?m, 250 x 4,6 mm) e coluna preparativa Phenomenex Luna C18 (10 μm, 250 x 21,20 mm). Os solventes orgânicos utilizados para obtenção de extratos e fracionamentos foram das marcas Mallinckrodt, Synth e J. T. Baker (grau CLAE). A água (grau CLAE) foi obtida usando um sistema de purificação Milli-Q Plus (Millipore). As soluções foram concentradas em evaporador rotativo Buchi R-114, sob pressão reduzida. Os espectros de massas de baixa resolução foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Platfform, no modo electrospray. Os espectros de infravermelho foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Nicolet-730 FT-IR. Material vegetal Michelia champaca L. (Magnoliaceae) foi coletada no Campus da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), em Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brasil e identificada pela Dra. Inês Cordeiro do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado de São Paulo. Extração e isolamento dos constituintes químicos Os caules M. champaca foram secos à temperatura ambiente, moídos e submetidos à percolação em etanol, resultando no extrato bruto (55,30 g), após evaporação do solvente sob pressão reduzida. O extrato bruto foi solubilizado em MeOH/H2O (70:30, v/v) e submetico à partição com solventes de diferentes polaridades, fornecendo as fases hexânica (9,00 g), diclorometânica (13,04 g), acetato de etila (4,82 g), n-butanólica (11,90 g) e hidroalcóolica (9,08 g). Todas essas fases foram bioensaiadas para averiguação da atividade antifúngica. Parte da fase diclorometânica (6,5 g), a qual foi a única a apresentar atividade, foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna (CC) usando sílica gel (70 – 230 mesh) e eluída com hexano/AcOEt e AcOEt/MeOH em misturas de polaridade crescente, fornecendo 22 frações, após análise por cromatografia em camada delgada. A fração 8 (690 mg, eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 80:20, v/v) foi submetida à CC utilizando sílica de fase reversa C18, eluída com MeOH/H2O em gradiente decrescente de polaridade, obtendo-se 6 frações. A subfração 8.3 (74,2 mg, eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 40:60, v/v) foi submetida a CLAE preparativa em fase reversa C18 (λ = 254 nm, MeOH/H2O 80:20 (v/v), fluxo de 10 mL min-1), 14 Ecl. Quím., São Paulo, 32(3): 13-18, 2007 fornecendo as substâncias 1 (4,6 mg) e 2 (3,7 mg). A fração 7 (420 mg, Hex/AcOEt 10:90, v/v) foi cromatografada em coluna de fase reversa C18, eluída em MeOH/H2O em gradiente crescente de polaridade, obtendo- se 10 frações. A subfração 7.5 (69,6 mg, MeOH/H2O 65:35, v/v) foi submetida a CLAE preparativa λ = 247 nm, MeOH/ H2O 50:50 (v/v), fluxo de 17 mL min-1) e forneceu a substância 3 (9,3 mg). A fração 5 (380 mg, Hex/AcOEt 40:60, v/v) foi também submetida a cromatografia em fase reversa, à vácuo, fornecendo 11 frações. A subfração 5.8 (70,9 mg, MeOH/H2O 80:20, v/v) foi submetida a cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa de fase normal, sendo eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 20:80 (v/v) e fornecendo a substância 4 (8,0 mg), após recristalização em MeOH. Uma nova porção do extrato bruto (25,0 g) foi solubilizada em HCl 5%, após precipitação do material graxo com metanol. Fez-se, em seguida, extração com AcOEt, basificação da fase aquosa e novamente extração com AcOEt [11]. A fração alcaloídica (247,4 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna utilizando C18, eluída em MeOH/H2O em gradiente decrescente de polaridade, fornecendo a substância 5 (14,5 mg, MeOH/H2O 70:30, v/v). Bioensaio antifúngico Estes ensaios foram realizados no laboratório do Instituto de Botânica de São Paulo sob a supervisão da Dra. Maria Cláudia Marx Young. Suspensões contendo esporos dos fungos das espécies Cladosporium cladosporoides e Cladosporium sphaerospermum foram utilizadas como reveladores em cromatografia em camada delgada para a realização da bioautografia [12]. A amostra de extratos foi aplicada em cromatoplacas e eluída com solventes adequados. Após a evaporação dos solventes e localização das manchas por meio de absorção no ultravioleta, uma solução de glicose e sais contendo esporos do fungo foi nebulizada sobre as placas que foram incubadas à temperatura de 25º C em câmara úmida e escura durante 2 a 3 dias. Após o tempo de incubação, observou-se o crescimento do fungo sobre a placa. Nos locais onde existem substâncias fungitóxicas surge um halo de inibição. Foi utilizado nistatina (1 μg) como padrão positivo. Resultados e Discussão As fases hexânica, diclorometânica, acetato de etila, n-butanólica e hidroalcóolica, provenientes da partição líquido-líquido do extrato etanólico, foram bioensaiadas com os fungos Cladosporium cladosporoides e C. sphaerospermum, sendo que apenas a fase diclorometânica apresentou atividade moderada. Esta fase foi, então, fracionada em coluna cromatográfica de fase normal fornecendo dois derivados fenilpropanoídicos, álcool 4-O-β-D-glicopiranosídeo sinapílico (1) e aldeído 4-O-β-D-glicopiranosídeo sinápico (2), uma lignana siringaresinol (3) e um alcalóide N-acetilnonaina (4) (Figura 1). Avaliação prévia do extrato bruto com revelador draggendorff, detectou a ocorrência de alcalóides na matriz vegetal. Assim, o extrato bruto foi submetido a extração ácido-base para obtenção de uma fração rica em alcalóides, que foi fracionada em coluna cromatográfica de fase reversa e levou ao isolamento de liriodenina (5) (Figura 1). As estruturas de todas as substâncias isoladas foram determinadas através de métodos espectroscópicos (EM, IV e RMN de 1H e 13C, uni e bidimensionais) e confirmadas através da comparação com dados da literatura. Todas as substâncias isoladas do extrato ativo e a substância 5 foram submetidas a bioautografia com os fungos Cladosporium cladosporoides e C. sphaerospermum, e as substâncias 3 e 5 15 Ecl.

The gingerols puriﬁcation was carried out in HPLC system using a Luna-C18 and the best mobile phase evaluated was MeOH/H2O (75:25, v/v). This new methodology for the gingerols isolation was very effective, since considerable amounts (in the range of milligrams) with a good purity degree (∼98%) were achieved in 30 min of chromatographic run. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol puriﬁed by this methodology inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 ± 134.6 M, 135.6 ± 22.6 M and 12.1 ± 0.3 M, respectively. These substances also inhibited human ﬁbroblasts (HF) cell proliferation, however in concentrations starting from 500 M. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an optimization of gingerols isolation and their speciﬁc anti-proliferative activities against tumor cells, suggesting their use as important models for drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Several population-based studies indicate that people in Asian countries have a much lower risk of different cancer types such as colon, gastrointestinal, prostate and breast, when compared to their Western counterparts. It is widely claimed that constituents of their diet such as ginger, garlic, soy, curcumin, onion, tomatoes, cru- ciferous vegetables, chillies, and green tea contribute to that lower incidence [1]. Therefore, there is increasing interest in naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive agents. Ginger (Zingiber ofﬁcinale Roscoe) is widely used worldwide as a food, spice and herb [2]. Together with [6]-gingerol, [8]- and [10]- gingerol are the major pungent constituents in the ginger oleoresin ∗Corresponding author.

Gin- gerols comprise a series of homologue substances differentiated by the length of their alkyl chains with [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol having 10, 12 and 14 carbons in their unbranched alkyl chains, respectively [3]. Regarding [6]-gingerol a variety of pharmacological charac- teristics was already described, including analgesic, antipyretic, cardiotonic, hypothermia inducing and cancer preventing effects [4–6]. However, the effects on tumor cell proliferation for [8]- and [10]-gingerol are still scarce. Breast cancer is the third most frequent cancer in the world and one of the most common malignant diseases in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the second highest cause of death in women after cervical cancer [7]. To treat breast and many other cancer types, chemotherapy is one of the most extensively studied methods. However, its efﬁcacy and safety remain a primary con- cern as well as its toxicity and other side effects [8,9]. Another reason for concern regarding this method is the development of chemotherapy resistance, which is a major obstacle to the effec- tive treatment of many tumor types, including breast cancer [8]. Tumor cells are found to adopt multiple mechanisms to resist drugs, such as decreased uptake, and/or enhanced efﬂux and altered drug 1570-0232/$ – see front matter © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.07.013 158 J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 metabolism. Alteration in drug targets, activation of detoxiﬁcation systems, enhanced DNA repair ability, and inhibition of apoptosis are also cancer cell strategies to resist against chemotherapy drugs [10]. Many anticancer therapies can temporarily stop tumor growth; it means that, in most cases, the effect is not permanent. In this way, there is a signiﬁcant need for new agents with low susceptibility to common drug resistance mechanisms in order to improve response rates and potentially prolong patient’s survival. Approximately 30% of the women diagnosed with early-stage disease progress to metastatic breast cancer. To these women, therapeutic options are still limited. Current recommendations for ﬁrst-line chemotherapy include anthracycline-based and taxanes treatments (paclitaxel and docetaxel) [8]. Taxanes – which are taxol derivatives that were ﬁrst described as microtubule stabilizing agents [11] and then had their antineoplasic effects conﬁrmed [12,13] – are the ﬁrst example of natural product derivatives used in antitumor therapy. Therefore, the search for new natural products that may be used as an addi- tional alternative to the chemotherapy in an attempt to develop more effective drugs with fewer side effects is of great interest [14]. Based on this assumption it is important to develop an effective method for the isolation of these compounds. The aim of this work was to search a faster, efﬁcient and pro- ductive procedure for isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol by reverse phase HPLC operating under overloading conditions and to test their anti-proliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumor line and normal human ﬁbroblasts (HF), a non tumor cell line. The results presented in this study showed a more speciﬁc anti-proliferative activity for [8]- and [10]-gingerol against breast cancer compared to HF and suggest their use as important models for anti-cancer therapy in an attempt to develop new drugs with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol were isolated from the ethanol extract of the ginger rhizome (purchased locally) by liquid chro- matography. The structures were elucidated by 1H NMR using a Bruker DRX200 instrument (Bruker, USA), operating at 200 MHz for 1H spectra, with TMS as internal standard, GC–MS on a Shimadzu QP 5000 and comparison with literature data. The purity was deter- mined by elemental analysis on an EA 1108, CHNS-O (Fisons). HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from JTBaker Company (Netherland). Water was deionised. All other analytical grade reagents were from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation The fresh ginger rhizome was thin sliced, dried at 40 ◦C and ground to powder. The powder was extracted with ethanol for 72 h, three times. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 ◦C. The extraction of ginger (0.4 kg dry weight) yielded 21.2 g of crude extract (5.3%). The extract was stored at −4 ◦C for the later fractionation. In order to isolate [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, dry ginger rhizome crude ethanol extract was chromatographed on SiO2 (70–230 mesh) column with bed height 20 cm (20 cm × 8 cm i.d.), using initially n-hexane (1 L), to eliminate the lipids. After, n- hexane/ethyl acetate 50:50 (v/v, 2.5 L) was used as eluent resulting in 5 fractions (A1-5), where the fractions A1, A2, A3 and A4 (68.9%, 14.6 g), rich in [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerols, were joined resulting in the fraction A1–4. Part of this fraction (5.5 g) was re-chromatographed on SiO2 column (28 cm × 5 cm i.d.) using n-hexane/ethyl acetate 60:40 (v/v, 2.4 L). Forty eight fractions (50 mL each) were collected and combined after monitoring by TLC resulting in six sub-fractions with the following volumes: 250 mL (B1), 400 mL (B2), 150 mL (B3), 800 mL (B4), 200 mL (B5) and 600 mL (B6). The gingerols were the main constituent on the fraction B4 (800 mL, 2.8 g, yellow oil). Analytical and semi-preparative HPLC were carried out using a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP system with an SPD-10AVP UV–vis detec- tor with a ﬂow cell analytical or ﬂow cell preparative, according with the HPLC mode (analytical or semi-preparative), and a Shi- madzu LC-6AD pump. The isolation optimization was carried out on a Luna-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m, homemade, UFSCar, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) and the column was maintained at 25 ◦C, the detection wavelength was set at 282 nm and the ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phases consisted of isocratic binary mixtures (v/v) of MeOH/H2O (80:20; 75:25; 70:30) and ACN/H2O (67:33). Forty microlitres of methanol containing 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of B4 sample were injected. In the col- umn scale-up reverse phase semi-preparative, a Luna-C18 column (300 mm × 10 mm i.d., 10 m, homemade, UFSCar, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) was used. This column was maintained at 25 ◦C, the detec- tion wavelength was set at 254 nm (lower absorbance wavelength for the gingerols) and the ﬂow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The best mobile phase was MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v) and the scale-up factor was calculated using Eq. (1) below, where S, R, L, P, A are scale-up factor, column radius, column length, semi-preparative and ana- lytical columns, respectively. The maximum amount of fraction B4 injected in the semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg diluted to ﬁnal volume of 400 L. S = R2 PxLP R2 AxLA (1) 2.3. Cell line and culture MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor and HF cell lines, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), were maintained at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Cultilab – Campinas; SP, Brazil) containing 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum), penicillin (100 UI/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and l-glutamine (2 mM). Cell cultures and experiments were conducted in a humid- iﬁed environment with 5% CO2 at 37 ◦C. 2.4. Proliferation assays Cell lines were prepared at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/200 L, in appropriate medium with 10% of FBS, and plated on sterile 96-well plates for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14–18 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, known as starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation, the culture medium was removed from the wells and a new one, supplemented with 10% of FBS, containing different concentrations of the tested compounds was added to the wells. The cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h under the same conditions as described above. Cell proliferation assay was performed in comparison to the wells where the vehicle compound (2.5% DMSO) was added instead of the tested compounds. After incubation, the culture medium of each well was removed and a solution containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added (100 L/well). The plates were then kept at 37 ◦C for 4 h and the formed crystals were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. The absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 595 nm. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control for inhibition of cell proliferation [15]. J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 159 Fig. 1. Chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]-gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 80:20; MeOH/H2O 75:25, ACN/H2O 67:23 and MeOH/H2O 70:30, UV detection at 282 nm and ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 40 L. 2.5. Statistical analysis Each experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and a standard error mean was calculated. Shapiro–Wilk’s W test was used to verify data normality. As normal distribution was present, the results were compared statistically with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Since the ANOVA tests showed signiﬁcant differences (acceptable P level < 0.05), Bonferroni’s signiﬁcant dif- ference post hoc analyses were performed to determine differences between simple and grouped main-effect means, respectively. The data were analyzed by using Statistica software (version 8.0; Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, USA) and IC50 calculations were made using Hill’s equation in the Origin software (version 8.5; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). 3. Results 3.1. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation Four different conditions were carried out on analytical C18 column HPLC to achieve the best separation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol. The best separation condition was achieved using MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v), where a good separation of three gingerols in a single run of 30 min was obtained (Fig. 1). The injection volume (400 L) was larger than the usual size of an injection volume and also it was not the one that was calcu- lated by the scale up formula. This occurred because of the sample viscosity, which would be very high if 170.1 mg were diluted in 230 L (calculated volume) that would impair the chromatographic separation. For column overloading with the sample, increasing amounts of fraction B4 (0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg diluted to ﬁnal volume 40 L) were injected in a C18 analytical column. Using the detector at 282 nm electronic saturation was observed when 5 mg of sample was injected, although the peaks were still visible for isolation of gingerols until 15 mg. With the injection of 30 mg of sample, the electronic saturation hindered the visualization of peaks closer to peak 1 (Fig. 2). To solve this prob- lem, on the semi-preparative mode, the detector was set at 254 nm and in this condition it was possible to identify the three gingerols present in the fraction. Fig. 2. Overload chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]- gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 75:25, UV detection at 282 nm and ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injected masses were 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. The injection volume was 40 L. Using Eq. (1) for the determination of scale-up factor, the value 5.67 was obtained, consequently the maximum amount of B4 frac- tion that could be injected in a semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg (Fig. 3). However, to make the adjustment of the ﬂow rate easier we decided to use 6.0 mL/min instead of 5.67 mL/min, and by working in this condition the results obtained were satisfactory. The mass of each gingerol obtained from 170.1 mg of fraction B4 was: 94 mg ([6]-gingerol), 22 mg ([8]-gingerol) and 17 mg ([10]- gingerol). The purity of gingerols was calculated based on the elemental analysis of each gingerol. The puriﬁcation yields based on the fresh ginger weight were 1027, 241 and 187 ppm for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. The purity obtained was 94.4, 99 and 97.3% for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. Fig. 3. Scale-up chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]- gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (300 mm × 10 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 75:25, UV detection at 254 nm and ﬂow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The injected masses were 85.1 mg, 170.1 mg. The injection volume was 400 L. 160 J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 Fig. 4. Effects of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 and Human Fibroblasts cell proliferation. MDA-MB-231 tumor cells or Human Fibroblasts were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/200 L in a 96-well plate containing DMEM medium with 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum) for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14–18 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, named starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation the monolayers were incubated with different concentrations of [6]-, [8]- or [10]-gingerol in DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% of FBS. The cells were incubated for 24 (A) or 48 (B) hours. Viable cells were estimated by the MTT assay. Results are mean ± SD of three independent assays in triplicate (a = [6]-gingerol vs. [8]-gingerol P < 0.05; b = [6]-gingerol vs. [10]-gingerol P < 0.01; c = [8]-gingerol vs. [10]-gingerol P < 0.001). 3.2.

Effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol on normal and tumor cell proliferation The effects of isolated compounds, [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-gingerol, were compared to their effects on HF, a normal (non tumor) cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). In these assays, the controls were made by incubating the cells in a normal medium, supplemented with 10% of FBS (+FBS), in a medium without FBS (−FBS), adding DMSO (ﬁnal concentration of 2.5%) to the medium supplemented with 10% of FBS (DMSO) and ﬁnally, in doxorubicin (1.5 M), a compound used in breast cancer chemotherapy, as a positive control for cell proliferation inhibition [15]. The results showed that [8]-gingerol affects MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation after 24 h of incubation, with 500 and 1000 M inhibiting approximately 75% and 50% of tumor cell prolifera- tion, respectively (Fig. 4A and B). After 48 h of incubation with [8]-gingerol 100 M there was approximately 60% of MDA-MB- 231 cell proliferation inhibition (Fig. 4B). At the same incubation period with [8]-gingerol 500 and 1000 M, MDA-MB-231 inhibi- tion remained in a rate of 75% compared to control cells (+FBS). [8]-Gingerol 1, 10 and 50 M had no effects on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation (Fig. 4A and B). Fig. 5. Differential effects of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 M on MDA-MB- 231 and Human Fibroblasts cell proliferation after 48 h of incubation. Results are mean ± SD of three independent assays in triplicate (a = MDA-MB-231 vs. HF P < 0.01; b = MDA-MB-231 vs. HF P < 0.001). J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 161 For [10]-gingerol, a concentration of 100 M was signiﬁcantly effective in inhibiting MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at 24 h of incubation in a rate of 75%, compared to cells seeded on normal medium (+FBS). The same pattern was observed after 48 h of [10]- gingerol incubation; there was a cell proliferation inhibition of about 90% (Fig. 4B). HF were used in order to compare the effects of both [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in a non tumor cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). No signiﬁcant differences in MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation using 1, 10, 50 and 100 M for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in 24 or 48 h of incubation were veriﬁed. However, 500 and 1000 M concentra- tions were effective in this inhibition, but in an approximate rate of only 50% (Fig. 4A and B). The differential effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 M after 48 h of incubation with HF and MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line are demonstrated in Fig. 5. These compounds were more effective in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (MDA-MB-231) when compared to normal cell proliferation (HF). The IC50 values for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation were calculated. The results showed that these compounds inhibited the prolifera- tion of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 ± 134.6 M; 135.6 ± 22.6 M and 12.1 ± 0.3 M, respectively. These substances also inhibit HF cell proliferation, nevertheless, we were not able to calculate the IC50 values for this cell line, since the initial concen- tration that had an effect was 500 M for [6]-, [8] and [10]-gingerol. 4. Discussion Studies of isolation and puriﬁcation of gingerols are scarce in the literature. Considering the interesting biological activities and the potential of these compounds to the medical area it is imperative to develop new methodologies to achieve an optimization of gin- gerol separation and puriﬁcation. The isolation of gingerols ([6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol) described in this work was achieved satis- factorily, once it was possible to obtain relatively high mass and a good degree of gingerols purity. To our knowledge, only one work about isolation of gingerols using HPLC system was published [18]. In this work, the authors isolated the major gingerols from the crude dichloromethane extract of ginger rhizome by normal phase HPLC. A low purity degree (calculated by the percentage of peak area) for both, [8]-gingerol (86%) and [10]-gingerol (84%) was achieved, while for the [6]-gingerol the purity was 99%. The purity degree obtained for each gingerol does not represent the real one, because HPLC system using UV detection does not guarantee the absence of other components in the sample. In a recent work, the isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol was carried out using counter-current chromatography (CCC). In this study gingerols were obtained with high purity degree (99%), however the time of chromatographic run was very length (240 min) [19]. In another work regarding iso- lation of gingerols from crude extract of ginger rhizome using CCC the time of chromatographic run was again very extensive, and the purity was about 98% [20]. Electronic saturation is a factor that considerable limits the increasing of injected mass in the semi-preparative scale. In our work, this factor had limited injections of samples with higher masses, even at a wavelength of low absorption of gingerols (254 nm) (Fig. 3). However, the gingerols were isolated in sig- niﬁcant quantities and with a good purity degree. To avoid the electronic saturation we could use either a less sensitive ﬂow cell or make the adjustment of the wavelength well off the lambda max. We have not tried a less sensitive cell, however all the experiment conditions were tested in the lower absorption wavelength for the gingerols, and we still obtained electronic saturation. It may be possible to use other detectors even though we have only used UV. The effects of [6]-gingerol on tumor cell proliferation are already well documented [5,21–23], however, the effects of [8]- and [10]- gingerol on tumor cells are still scarce. In fact, among all the ginger constituents, much more attention has been given to [6]-gingerol in order to explore its pharmacological properties and action mech- anisms. In this sense, besides [6]-gingerol effects, those of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on in vitro tumor cell proliferation using MDA-MB- 231 and HF cell lines were also investigated. The overall results suggest that the higher the alkyl chain, the greater the effectiveness of gingerol in inhibiting tumor cell pro- liferation, probably due to the manner in which these substances enter the cells through their plasma membrane. In general, with increasing alkyl chain lengths, there is an increase in lipophilic character (log P) of compounds, and this can be quantiﬁed by the partition coefﬁcient (P) in an n-octanol/water system. It is also known that the higher the log P value, to a certain extent, the higher will be the permeation in biological membranes [24,25]. This can be extended to compounds such as gingerols, which represent a homologous series of substances. Similar effects of gingerols and other ginger-derived substances were already described in the literature. Tjendraputra et al. [26] demonstrated that the inhibition of COX-2 by ginger constituents and synthetic analogs was structure-dependent. The lipophilicity and the functional group substitution on the alkyl side chain, as well as the aromatic moiety were the main aspects inﬂuencing COX-2 inhibition. Similar correlations between the side-chain length of gingerols and their activities of apoptosis induction and neuronal cells protection from -amyloid insult have already been demon- strated [27,28]. The cytotoxic effect of [8]- and [10]-gingerol has been investi- gated by a few authors [27,29]. Kim and coworkers [29] have tested the effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol in a variety of human tumor cells lines including A-549 (lung cancer), SK-OV-3 (ovarian cancer), SK- MEL-2 (skin cancer) and HCT15 (colon cancer). They found an IC50 ranging from approximately 4.52 g/mL (13 M) to 12.57 g/mL (40 M), with [10]-gingerol being more effective than [8]-gingerol in decreasing the viability of these tumor cell lines [29]. Wei and coworkers [27] found an IC50 of 87.9 ± 3.5 M and 56.5 ± 6.0 M for [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively, in the inhibition of HL-60 proliferation, a human leukemia tumor cell line. These data are in accordance with the ﬁndings in this work on MDA-MB-231 cells, revealing the same activity dependence on the chain length size pattern. Kuo and collaborators [30] working with SW480 cells, a lin- eage of colorectal cancer, observed that [10]-gingerol caused a signiﬁcant concentration-dependent and sustained [Ca2+]i rise, suggesting that this elevation can alter cellular functions, leading to cell death. They found a cytotoxic effect of [10]-gingerol 50, 75 and 100 M [30]. It is important to notice that the methodology in the present study was different, even though, similar effects were found in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line. Our ﬁndings demonstrate a speciﬁcity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on the inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation when com- pared to non tumor human ﬁbroblast cell line. The ﬁndings of other authors corroborate with our results. Kazi et al. [31] described the effects of antibiotics derived from -lactam, lactam 1 and 12 on normal and tumor cells. They show that lactam 1 selectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat T, but not in the non transformed, immortalized human natural killer cells. Further- more, the authors demonstrated that lactam 12 induces apoptosis selectively in Jurkat T and simian virus 40-transformed, but not in non transformed NK and parental normal ﬁbroblast cells. The authors propose that these N-thiolated -lactams act by inducing DNA damage that leads to apoptosis preferentially in cancer and transformed over normal/non transformed cells. Another exam- ple includes pancratistatin, a natural compound isolated from the 162 J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 spider lily, which is an efﬁcient inducer of apoptosis in human lymphoma (Jurkat) cells, with minimal effect on normal nucleated blood cells. The authors discuss that this selective effect could be due to the expression of the Fas receptors, which are found to be greater in blood lymphoma cells than normal blood cells. Further- more, in fast-dividing cancer cells, the plasma membrane tends to run short of lipids, perhaps changing the ﬂuidity of the membrane [32]. Ovadje et al. [33] demonstrate that dandelion root extract is capable of inducing apoptosis at low concentrations speciﬁcally in cancer cells with no toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, Mathen et al. [34] working with extracts from Calotropis gigantea, the giant milkweed, traditionally used for the treatment of cancer and in Ayurvedic medicine and Poecilocerus pic- tus, an orthopteran insect, which feeds on C. gigantea, demonstrated that both the insect and the plant extracts induce concentration- dependent apoptosis and differentiate between human cancer cells and normal cells and exhibit species speciﬁcity. The chemopreventive mechanisms of gingerols are not well understood however, are thought to involve proapoptotic [27,35–37], antioxidant [38], anti-inﬂammatory [6,39–41], and anti-angiogenic [42] activities. Further investigation will be done in order to determine the mechanisms by which [8]- and [10]- gingerol act inhibiting with more speciﬁcity the MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, this work presents a new methodology for the isolation of gingerols, which proved to be effective, once consid- erable amounts with a good purity degree in a relatively short time of chromatographic run were achieved from these important bioactive compounds, mainly [8]-gingerol (99%) and [10]-gingerol (97.3%). This is the ﬁrst report on the separation of these com- pounds with such a purity degree using HPLC semi-preparative scale. Optimizations in the separation process regarding column overloading can still be made so that the electron saturation be not reached, which can be achieved by using other less sensitive detec- tors. The gingerols isolated through this methodology, demonstrate an anti-proliferative activity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol speciﬁcally on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells when compared to HF normal cells. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst report regarding a speciﬁc cell effect of ginger derivatives. The results also suggest the use of [8]- and [10]-gingerol as important models for anti-cancer therapy and drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.

Keywords: Petiveria alliacea; Phytolacaceae; Antifungal polysulphides 1. Introduction Petiveria alliacea L. (Phytolacaceae) is a shrub widely distributed in South and Central America. It grows in all regions of Brazil where it is known by many popular names. Among these, ‘‘erva-guine´ ’’, ‘‘guine´ ’’, ‘‘pipi’’ and ‘‘tipi’’; and the Tupi-Guarani ‘‘macuracaa´ ’’ are note- worthy (Hoehne, 1939; Pio Correa, 1969). In the State of Minas Gerais the roots of this plant are used to treat rheumatism (De Sousa et al., 1987) and in other Brazi- lian regions, both the roots and the leaves are popularly used as stimulants and abortefacients (Da Silva, 1935). Previous work on P. alliacea revealed the occurrence of coumarins, triterpenes and ﬂavonoids (Rocha and Da Silva, 1969; Delle Monache and Suarez, 1992), amino acids and trisulphide (Adegosan, 1974). In continuing our search for biologically active compounds from the Brazilian ﬂora (Carbonezi et al., 1999), a CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1 v/v) extract of the roots of this plant was selected for phytochemical investigation due to its signiﬁcant activity against some mutant yeast strains of Saccharomyces cer- evisiae (Gunatilaka et al., 1994) and inhibition of the growth of Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaer- ospermum (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). This study led to the isolation of ﬁve new polysulphides (2, 3, 5, 6 and 7), together with two known compounds (1, 4). Among the known compounds described in this study, only com- pound 4 had been previously isolated from this plant species (De Sousa et al., 1990). 2. Results and discussion The CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1) extract of roots of P. alliacea L. inhibited strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RS 188N, RS 52YK and RS 321) indicating strong activity of this extract towards the mutant strains of yeast. This extract was also shown to possess potent inhibitory activity against Cladosporium cladosporioides and Clado- sporium sphaerospermum fungi. Solvent–solvent par- titioning of the bioactive crude extract aﬀorded hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc fractions, in which the activities were concentrated. These fractions were individually sub- jected to silica gel column chromatography, using CH2Cl2 or CH2Cl2/MeOH as eluents, to obtain six major bioactive fractions. The puriﬁcation of these fractions was performed on silica gel preparative TLC, reversed-phase Sep Pak cartridge and HPLC aﬀording seven bioactive polysulphide compounds. 0031-9422/01/$ - see front matter # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

E-mail address: bolzaniv@iq.unesp.br (V. da S. Bolzani). The molecular formula of compound 1 was deter- mined as C6H14S2, by 1H, 13C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Three resonances at 2.66 t (J=7.25 Hz), 1.72 dq (J=7.5, 6.5) and 0.99 t (J=7.26 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum were characteristic of a propyl moiety (Table 1). The 13C NMR data also supported the propyl skeleton (Table 2). The proton resonance at 2.66, cor- responding to a methylene group, was attributed to a sulfur-bearing carbon atom, which was conﬁrmed by elemental analysis and interpretation of its mass spec- trum. According to these data the structure of 1 was assigned as dipropyl disulphide, which is reported as a natural derivative in Phytolacaceae for the ﬁrst time. Compounds 2–5 exhibited common features in their MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The presence of a sig- niﬁcant ion peak at m/z 91, which is characteristic of a benzyl fragment was observed in all mass spectra of these compounds. The benzyl portion appeared to bear one, two, three and four sulfur atoms, respectively, based on the elemental analyses. The 1H NMR spectra (Table 1) of 2, 3, 4 and 5 presented the same signal, around 7.30, compatible with a monosubstituted aromatic ring. The major diﬀerences observed in the 1H NMR spectra of each compound was due to the chemical shift of the methylene benzylic hydrogens linked to the sulfur, which in compound 2 appeared at 3.66; 3 at 4.05; 4 at 4.15 (De Souza et al., 1990) and 5 at 4.19, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) of these compounds, interpreted with the aid of DEPT spectra, indicated the presence of one quaternary C and ﬁve CH’s sp2 carbons attributable to an aromatic monosubstituted ring and one sp3 CH2 assigned to a benzylic carbon. The ele- mental analysis and HRMS data of compounds 2–5 ﬁrmly established the number (and amount) of sulfur atoms in these polysulphides and conﬁrmed their iden- tities as dibenzyl sulphide (2), dibenzyl disulphide (3), dibenzyl trisulphide (4) and dibenzyl tetrasulphide (5), respectively. Polysulphide 4 has previously been reported from this species (De Souza et al., 1990). Compound 6, isolated as an oil, gave IR absorption bands at 3335 (OH), 1580, and 1495 cm1 (Ar). The EI MS showed a molecular ion peak [M]+ at m/z 154 that together with 13C NMR and elemental analysis estab- lished a molecular formula of C8H10SO. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) of this compound resem- bled closely those of dibenzyl sulphide (2). Prominent dif- ferences in the 1H and 13C spectroscopic values between 2 and 6 were observed only in the aliphatic region; one extra methylene signal was observed at 5.03 s ( 78.50, CH2). These results allowed us to deduce that compound Fig. 1. Selected HMBC correlations for compounds 6 and 7.

Coelho Benevides et al. / Phytochemistry 57 (2001) 743–747 6 had an hydroxymethyl group linked to the sulfur in place of the second benzylic group as in compound 2. Interpretation of some HMBC data (Fig. 1) aided eluci- dation of this structure. Correlations observed between the methylene protons signal at 5.03 with the benzylic carbon at 44.27 and the methylene protons signal at 3.60 with the carbons at 78.50 and 127.42 established compound 6 as benzylhydroxymethyl monosulphide. Polysulphide 7 is closely comparable with dibenzyl tri- sulphide (4); comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) data with those of 4 showed that the only diﬀerences observed were due to chemical shift of the benzylic hydrogens, which in 7 appeared at 4.20 (C=43.19) and the presence of an additional singlet signal at 5.30, which was attributed to methylene pro- tons by the analysis inferred by COSY, HMQC and DEPT spectral data. Analysis of 13C NMR spectro- scopic data recorded a methylene benzylic carbon at 43.19 and a second one, extremely unshielded at 106.32, whose chemical shift could be explained by the stereo- eletronic eﬀects of several sulfur atoms linked to meth- ylene carbon. In fact, no correlations were observed in the spectra of the 1H–1H COSY and HMBC (Fig. 1) of the corresponding methylene protons with other protons or carbons, respectively in 7. The elemental analysis, together with HRMS analysis established its molecular formula as C15H16S6 and thus conﬁrmed 7 to be di(ben- zyltrithio) methane. Bioautography with the plant pathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was employed to guide fractionation and isolation of the polysulphides 1– 7, these being responsible for the fungicidal activity detected in the crude extract (Table 3). Similar or higher to the reference compound Nystatin, the polysulphides 1–4 showed potent inhibition, while compounds 5–7 showed marginal activity against fungal growth (10.0 >25 and 5.0 mg, respectively), in both phytopathogenic strains tested. Furthermore, their potential anticancer activities were also tested, using a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka et al., 1994). Compounds 1, 3 and 5 had moderate eﬀect on DNA, as deduced by the selective inhibition of the mutant strains RS 321 and RS 52YK, relative to the wild strain RS 188N (Table 3). 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation 1H NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer, using TMS as an int. standard. The 13C NMR (50 or 75 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 and DPX-300 spectro- meter. EI-MS were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/ 5988 A spectrometer and on a VG platform II spectro- meter. Elemental analysis was performed on a Perkin- Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer 2400. IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR 1750 Perkin Elmer and FT-IR 510 Nicolet. UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV/vis Hitachi U-3000. 3.2. Plant material The species Petiveria alliacea L. was collected in Sep- tember and October (1997) in the Instituto Butanta˜ Reserve, in the city of Sa˜ o Paulo. Whole shrubs were collected and separated in their distinct parts: leaves, stems and roots. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆ nica-SMA, under the number SP112.6.84. 3.3.

TLC bioautography assay: Cladosporium cladospor- ioides Fresen de Vries SPC 140 and Cladosporium sphaerospermum Penzig SPC 491 were maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆ nica-SMA. Ten microliters of the solutions of crude extracts, fractions and pure com- pounds were prepared, in diﬀerent concentrations: cor- responding to 20, 10, 1, 0.1 mg for pure compounds and 100, 50, 30 and 20 mg for the crude extracts or fractions, respectively. The samples were applied to TLC plates, these being eluted with the appropriate solvent system followed by complete removal of the solvent. The chro- matographic plates were sprayed with spores suspension of C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides in a nutri- tive medium and incubated for 48 h at 37C. After incubation, clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background chromatogram. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents Roots, stems, and leaves of P. alliacea L. were dried at room temperature, powdered and extracted three times with CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1, v/v), for two days, at room temperature. The resulting extracts were ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to yield 7.0, 8.0 and 15 g of root, stem and leaf extracts, respectively. Due to the higher bioactivity noted, half of the root extract was sus- pended in MeOH:H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. After liquid/liquid partition, the resulting residue was concentrated in vacuo and extracted with H2O. Bioactiv- ity-guided fractionation of the hexane, CHCl3, and EtOAc solubles, using silica gel column chromatography and hexane, CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2:EtOAc and CH2Cl2:MeOH (with increasing polarity) as eluants, aﬀorded several fractions, whose bioactivities were detected only in six of them. The ﬁrst hexane fraction was applied to a Si gel column eluting with a hexane:CH2Cl2 gradient to aﬀord compound 1 (22 mg). The fractions eluted with CH2Cl2:EtOAc were further subjected to silica gel col- umn chromatography using a MeOH:H2O gradient. The intermediary fractions of this column, puriﬁed by HPLC using a C-18 Econosil column, 5 mm, 2504 mm i.d., with an elution gradient of MeOH:H2O (70:30) 7 min; MeOH:H2O (90:10) 15 min. and MeOH (100%) 20 min with ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min yielded the compounds 2 (7.8 mg), 3 (4.5 mg), 4 (15.0 mg) and 5 (3.6 mg). The EtOAc soluble fraction, was subjected to Si gel column chromatography using CH2Cl2:EtOAc with increasing polarity. The fractions obtained with CH2Cl2: EtOAc (7:3) aﬀorded 6 (3.8 mg). Compound 7 (2.0 mg) was isolated from the hexane fraction, by further puriﬁca- tion over column chromatography on Si gel eluted with CH2Cl2:EtOAc (8:2). 3.4.1.

The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of their spectroscopic data. Iridoid 1 and saponin 2 exhibited moderate inhibitory activities against Candida albicans and C. krusei in a dilution assay. Introduction. – Alibertia edulis (Rich.) A. Rich. ex DC, commonly known as @marmelada-bolaA, is widely spread in the Brazilian @CerradoA. The Alibertia genus is known for the occurrence of iridoids, triterpenoids and phenolic derivatives [2 – 6]. Recent phytochemical investigations of stems of A. macrophylla led to the isolation of a diterpene, 2b,3a,16a-trihydroxy ent-kaurane [5]. Previous studies of the leaves of A. edulis resulted in the isolation of ten triterpenes [7]. In our continuing chemical and biological investigations of the Brazilian Rubiaceae plant species, we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new iridoid, 6b-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester (1), and a new saponin 3b-O-[a-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyrano- syl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl]-28-O-b-d-glucopyranoside pomolate (2), from A. edulis stems together with known iridoids: shanzhiside methyl ester (3) and ixoside (4), and phenolic derivative 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 1-O-b-d-apiofuranosyl-(1 ! 6)-O-b-d- glucopyranoside (5). We also report strong antifungal activity against pathogenic Candida-species yeast and Cryptococcus neoformans of the AcOEt extract of this species and, the moderate antifungal activity of compounds 1 and 2. Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1355 D 2008 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, ZHrich 1) Part of the results have been presented with a poster at the 1st Brazilian Conference of Natural Products on November 4th – 7th, 2007 [1]. Results and Discussion. – The EtOH extract prepared from dried and powdered stems of A. edulis was submitted to partition in hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH. The preliminary biological screening indicated that the AcOEt extract showed antifungal activity (cf. Table 4). Fractionation and purification over silica RP-18 led to the isolation of compounds 1 – 5. The known compounds 3 – 5 were identified by comparing their spectroscopic data to those reported in literature [8 – 10]. Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of 1 showed a peak at m/z 403.1289 ([M H]), determining the molecular formula as being C17H24O11, and a peak at m/z 241.0738 ([M H 162]), corresponding to the loss of a hexose moiety. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic data were consistent with a b-glucopyranosyl unit and an iridoid aglycone. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals at d(H) 7.34 (d, J ¼ 1.0, HC(3)) and 5.61 (d, J ¼ 2.0, HC(1)) corresponding to an iridoid dihydropyran ring. The signal at d(H) 3.64 (s, 3 H) corresponded to a MeO group, and the signal at d(H) 5.21 (d, J ¼ 2.5, 2 H) corresponded to an exocyclic ¼CH2 group. An anomeric H-atom signal at d(H) 4.41 (d, J ¼ 8.5) confirmed the presence of a sugar residue with b-configuration. The 13C-NMR spectrum of 1 showed 17 signals. The C-atom signals at d(C) 35.5 (C), 41.8 (C), 95.0 (CH), 107.9 (C) and 152.2 (CH) were attributed to C-atoms C(5), C(9), C(1), C(4), and C(3), respectively of the dihydropyran ring of the iridoid aglycone. The remaining C-atoms signals, d(C) 73.7 (CH) and 73.5 (CH) were assigned to C(6) and C(7), respectively, and the signals at d(C) 110.0 (CH2(10)) and 150.4 (C(8)) were attributed to an exo-methylene function present in the structure. The gHMBC spectrum confirmed the assignment of C(6) and Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1356 C(7) due to the 3J-correlation observed between HC(10) (d(H) 5.21) and C(7) (d(C) 73.5). The attachment of the b-d-glucopyranosyl moiety in 1 was established as in C(1) position in the aglycone, on the basis of the cross-peak correlations, in gHMBC, between HC(1’) (d(H) 4.41) and C(1) (d(C) 95.0) (Table 1). The a-orientation of HC(1) and b-orientation of HC(5) and HC(9) is in accordance with the biosynthetic origin of the iridoids [11]. The coupling constant between HC(5) and HC(6) (J < 1.0 Hz), together with the upfield shift of C(1) (d(C) 95.0), and the calculation of the shift difference between C(3) and C(4) (Dd ¼ 44.3) indicated that the orientation of the OH group at C(6) was b [12]. The appearance of HC(6) as a broad singlet (d(H) 4.08) provided a small coupling constant between HC(6) and HC(7) (J < 1.0 Hz), corresponding to a dihedral angle close to 908, necessitating a trans-relationship between these H-atoms, which suggested the a- orientation of the OH group at C(7) [13]. This configuration was confirmed on basis of NOESY interactions between HC(5) (d(H) 2.81) and HC(9) (d(H) 3.12 – 3.15, b- oriented), and no interactions between HC(6) or HC(7). Thus, the structure of compound 1 was elucidated as 6b-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester. Compound 2 was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of 2 showed a peak at m/z 1127.5641 ([M þ Na]þ), corresponding to the molecular formula C54H88O23. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals of seven Me groups at d(H) 0.81, 0.90, 0.99, 1.14, 1.23, 1.36 (s, each 3 H), and 0.96 (d, J ¼ 6.7, 3 H), and an olefinic H-atom at d(H) 5.33 (br. s). The 13C-NMR data confirmed the presence of seven Me C-atom signals at d(C) 15.8, 16.4, 16.7, 17.5, 24.6, 27.0, and 28.6, and a pair of olefinic C-atoms at d(C) 129.6 and 139.5, suggesting that the aglycone possesses an urs-12-ene skeleton. In the gHSQC spectrum, the long-range correlations observed for Me groups at d(H) 1.23 Table 1. 1H- and 13C-NMR Data of 1, together with gHMBC (H ! C) Correlations.

The presence of four sugar moieties was established from the signals of four anomeric H-atoms at d(H) 4.44 (d, J ¼ 7.7), 4.91 (d, J ¼ 7.6), 5.22 (br. s), and 5.36 (d, J ¼ 8.1), attached to the C-atoms at d(C) 105.5, 101.8, 101.9, and 95.6, respectively, in the gHSQC spectrum. The C-atom signals observed at d(C) 92.1 (C(3)) and 178.5 (C(28)) in the aglycone are consistent with a bidesmoside saponin moiety. Glyco- sylation of the alcoholic function at C(3) and esterification of the C(28)OOH group were indicated by the downfield shift (þ13.9 ppm) and upfield shift (2.1 ppm) observed, respectively, for the resonance of these C-atoms in 2, relative to the corresponding signals in pomolic acid [14]. To confirm our assumption regarding the glycosidic composition of this compound, an ESI-IT-MSn experiment was performed.

An adduct at m/z 1139 was observed, and it was tentatively assigned to [M H þ 2 H2O], which could result from the use of H2O to dissolve the sample [15]. The second order fragmentation of the adduct m/z 1139 led to a base peak at m/z 941 ([M 162 H]), indicating the loss of a hexose moiety. The MS3 fragmentation from this ion (m/z 941) gave a product ion at m/z 795 ([M 162 146 H]), corresponding to the loss of a deoxyhexose moiety. MS4 fragmentation from the ion m/z 795 yielded a peak at m/z 633 ([M (2 162) 146 H]), due to the loss of a second hexose moiety, and the MS5 fragmentation of this precursor ion produced a product ion at m/z 471 ([M (3 162) 146 H]), corresponding to the loss of a third hexose moiety and is in agreement with the molecular weight of the aglycone pomolic acid. The structures of the sugar moieties were deduced by 1D-TOCSY and 2D-NMR experiments (Table 3). The 1D-TOCSY method [16] allowed the subspectrum of a single monosaccharide unit to be extracted from the crowded overlapped region. Selected 1D-TOCSY data obtained by irradiation of each anomeric H-atom signal yielded the subspectrum of each sugar residue. Thus, the shifts of the sugar resonances were attributable to an a-l-rhamnopyranosyl (d(H) 5.22 (HC(1Rha)) and three b-d- glucopyranosyl (d(H) 4.44 (HC(1GlcI)), d(H) 4.91 (HC(1GlcII)), and d(H) 5.36 (HC(1GlcIII))) units. The b-orientation of all three anomeric centers of the glucopyranosyl moieties was supported by the relatively large coupling constant values observed for the HC(1GlcI) (d, J ¼ 7.7), HC(1GlcII) (d, J ¼ 7.6), and HC(1GlcIII) (d, J ¼ 8.1). And the a-orientation of the anomeric H-atom of the rhamnopyranosyl moiety was based on the multiplicity of the HC(1Rha) signal (br. s). The absolute configuration of the sugar residues has been tentatively determined by biogenetic considerations. The positions of the sugar moieties were unambiguously defined by the gHMBC experiment. A cross-peak due to long-range correlations between HC(1GlcI) (d(H) 4.44) and C(3) (d(C) 92.1) of the aglycone indicated that this sugar unit was linked at C(3) of the aglycone. Yet, a long-range connectivity between HC(1GlcIII) (d(H) 5.36) and C(28) (d(C) 178.5) indicated this sugar to be involved in an ester linkage with the C(28)OOH group. Similarly, cross-peaks were observed between HC(1GlcII) (d(H) 4.91) and C(2GlcI) (d(C) 78.1), and between HC(1Rha) (d(H) 5.22) and C(2GlcII) (d(C) 79.4). On the basis of these findings, compound 2 was established to be 3b-O-[a-l- rhamnopyranosyl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl]-28-O- b-d-glucopyranoside pomolate. All isolated compounds were evaluated with respect to antifungal activity (Table 4), and all showed moderate antifungal activity against Candida albicans and C. krusei in a dilution assay [17]. On the other hand, none of the compounds showed inhibitory effects against Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans within the concentration range tested (250.0 – 0.4 mg/ml). The stronger activity of the AcOEt extract compared to the isolated compounds may be due to the occurrence of tannins that were detected by FeCl3 and gelatin/NaCl tests [18]. Toxicity of tannins towards microorganisms is well documented [19]. This is the first report of the isolation of a saponin from the Alibertia genus. Among the isolated compounds, only 3 had already been reported in this genus [5]. Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1359 The species of the Rubiaceae family contains a great diversity of secondary metabolites: iridoids, indole alkaloids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, phenolic derivatives, diterpenes, triterpenes, and other types of alkaloids. The Alibertia genus is known for the occurrence of iridoids, triterpenoids and phenolic derivatives [2 – 6].

A voucher specimen (SP 370.913) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo – SP, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered stems (600.0 g) of A. edulis were extracted with EtOH (2 l, r.t., 3 d each time) to give a crude material (43.2 g), which was solubilized with MeOH/H2O (80 :20, v/v) and partitioned between hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH (3 800 ml each one).

The test organisms included Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), and Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012). The microorganisms were originally obtained from the Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1361 Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis at Sa˜o Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 h at r.t. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. The antifungal activity tests were performed using the broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications. The medium used was RPMI 1640, with l-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165m morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. The test samples were dissolved in DMSO. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline soln. with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted to 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be 1 · 105 to 5 · 105 CFU/ml. This suspension was inoculated onto a microdilution plate previously prepared with the test samples diluted to concentrations from 250 mg/ml to 0.4 mg/ml. The plates were incubated under agitation at 378 for 24 h for the Candida species, and 48 h for Cryptococcus neoformans. Fungal growth was evaluated visually and spectrophotometrically. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which the optical density (OD) was reduced to 90% of the OD of the growth control well. Amphotericin B (3 mg/ml) was used as positive control and DMSO as a negative control. MIC values were determined from three independent experiments. REFERENCES [1] V. C. da Silva, V. Carbone, S.

Nesse trabalho foi avaliada a atividade inibitória sobre a enzima glicossomal gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de T. cruzi (gGAPDH) de extratos vegetais oriundos de plantas das famílias Meliaceae e Rutaceae, na concentração de 100 mg/mL. Foram testados 46 extratos, dos quais 15 apresentaram atividade inibitória significativa (% AI ≥ 50). A maioria dos extratos de plantas da família Meliaceae (Cedrela fissilis, Cipadessa fruticosa e Trichilia ramalhoi) apresentou grande potencial em inibir a atividade enzimática. O fracionamento do extrato hexânico dos galhos de C. fruticosa permitiu o isolamento de três flavonóides: flavona, 7-metoxiflavona e 3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentametoxiflavona. Os dois últimos foram ativos na inibição da atividade de gGAPDH. Desta forma, as três espécies de Meliaceae testadas podem ser consideradas promissoras na busca de compostos protótipos para o controle da doença de Chagas.

ABSTRACT: The inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from Trypanosoma cruzi was evaluated at 100 mg/mL. Forty-six extracts were tested and fifteen of them showed significant inhibitory activity (IA % ≥ 50). The majority of the assayed extracts of Meliaceae plants (Cedrela fissilis, Cipadessa fruticosa and Trichilia ramalhoi) showed high ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity. The fractionation of the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa led to the isolation of three flavonoids: flavone, 7-methoxyflavone and 3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone. The two last compounds showed high ability to inhibit the gGAPDH activity. Therefore, the assayed Meliaceae species could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against Chagas’ disease. Keywords: Rutaceae, Meliaceae, flavonoids, gGAPDH, Trypanosoma cruzi, inhibitors. INTRODUCTION Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affects some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25 % of the total population are at risk of contamination (WHO, 2007). Control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and as consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are the major causes for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). Its treatment is still a challenge, since the only drug commercially available (benznidazole) has strong side effects (De Castro, 1993). The bloodstream form of parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae possesses a microbody-like Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 19(1A): Jan./Mar. 2009 2 Ana C. Leite, Alessandra R. P. Ambrozin, Marcelo S. Castilho, et al. organelle, where glycolysis takes place, the glycosome (Opperdoes & Borst, 1977). The bloodstream form of the parasite T. cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production. This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design (Souza et al., 1998). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) is a glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BGP). The three dimensional structure of T. cruzi gGAPDH previously determined shows differences, when compared to the homologous human enzyme that could be exploited for selective inhibition (Souza et al., 1998). The need for the development of more efficient drugs against Chagas’ disease has stimulated us to initiate a project aiming at the discovery of lead compounds from several plants of Rutales order. In this way, we have proposed the utilization of the glycolytic enzyme gGAPDH as a target for the search of new natural trypanocides (Tomazela et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Pavão et al., 2002; Moraes et al., 2003). In this paper, we report the gGAPDH inhibition activity of 46 crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants, along with three flavones isolated from an active fraction. Material and methods Plant material The fruits, branches, stems, roots, and leaves of Cedrela fissilis Vell. were collected in 01/06/01 in São Carlos (São Paulo, Brazil) and identified by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, where a voucher specimen (6701) was deposited. The fruits, branches and leaves of Cipadessa fruticosa Bl. were collected in 01/20/01 in Viçosa (Minas Gerais, Brazil) and identified by Dr. José R. Pirani from the Department of Botany, Universidade de São Paulo and deposited at the herbarium from this department with a voucher number 110.664. The branches of Almeidea coerulea A. St.-Hil., stems, and leaves of A. rubra A. St.-Hil., Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani, Galipea carinata Pirani (sp. nov.) and Trichilia ramalhoi Rizzini were collected in Southeastern Brazil, and identified by Dr. José R. Pirani from the Department of Botany, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. The specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of that Department. The voucher numbers and the dates of collection were described in Ambrozin et al. (2004). Preparation of crude extracts The powdered air-dried plant material (branches, fruits, leaves, roots, and/or stems) was extracted by maceration three times with hexane, at room temperature for 72 h. This process was repeated with dichloromethane and methanol for C. fissilis and C. fruticosa, and only with methanol for the other species. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed on T. cruzi gGAPDH enzyme. Isolation of compounds The hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (12.2 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-dichloromethane-ethyl acetate-methanol gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with a hexane-dichloromethane-acetone gradient to give 9 fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane-dichloromethane-acetone (6:3:1), affording 9 fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 1 (16.7 mg) and 2 (8.2 mg). Fraction 6 was twice submitted to column chromatography with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (6:3:1) giving compound 3 (30.6 mg). Compounds 1-3 were characterized by comparison of 13C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975; Passador et al., 1997) and submitted to the enzymatic assay. Preparation and purification of recombinant T. cruzi gGAPDH TcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as reported by Souza et al. (1998). It is maintained in the Crystallography Laboratory of the Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activity gGAPDH activity was determined according to a previously reported procedure (Barbosa & Nakano, 1987; Vieira et al., 2001). Reduced NADH was spectrophotometrically measured at 340 nm during 30 s. The reaction medium contains 50 mmol L-1 Tris-HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 b-mercapto- ethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD+, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 0.15 mg protein, in a total volume of 500 mL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate. The extracts were tested at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. Results In this work, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of 46 extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on T. cruzi gGAPDH enzyme (Table 1). Fifteen of them showed high ability in inhibit the enzyme (IA % > 50) at 100 mg/mL. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 19(1A): Jan./Mar. 2009 3 Screening of Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitors The hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFGH) and the methanol extracts from Meliaceae plants were the most active ones, whereas the extracts from Rutaceae did not present significant results. The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction (inhibitory activity = 81.9 % at 100 mg/ mL) from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFGH) led to the isolation of three flavonoids: flavone (1), 7-methoxyflavone (2) and 3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (3). The flavones 1 and 2 were assayed (Table 2) and the results showed that only 2 presented high inhibitory activity against gGAPDH enzyme. Discussion The results indicated that, among the assayed species, C. fissilis, C. fruticosa and Trichilia ramalhoi are promising sources of lead compounds for the rational design of new trypanocidal drugs. The inhibitory activity of the flavones 1 and 2 against gGAPDH has been reported for the first time. Recently, Ambrozin et al. (2004) published their activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi and Tadesmir et al. (2006) described the trypanocidal activity of some flavones. A previous study showed that compound 3 completely inhibited the gGAPDH activity at 268.8 mmol/L (Tomazela et al., 2000). Thus, the activity of the studied extract (CFGH) (Table 1) is probably related to the presence of the active flavones 2 and 3. However, their enzymatic activity were considered weak, particularly in comparison with chalepin, a coumarin isolated from Pilocarpus spicatus (Rutaceae), which reduced the gGAPDH activity by 75 % at 93 mmol/L (IC50 = 64 mmol/L) (Vieira et al., 2001; Pavão et al., 2002; Menezes et al., 2003; Moraes et al., 2003; Leitão et al., 2004). Similar studies involving the enzyme gGAPDH have been reported by our group. Vieira et al. (2001) showed the enzymatic activity of several plants of Rutaceae and Meliaceae families and thirteen coumarins isolated from different species, which are considered as one of the most promising class of substances with gGAPDH inhibitory activity. Moreover, the gGAPDH activity of several flavonoids isolated from Meliaceae, Rutaceae and Leguminosae plants, including pyrano chalcones, flavones, flavanones, flavonols and isoflavones, have also been reported (Tomazela et al., 2000; Moraes et al., 2003). Recently, Januário et al. (2005) described the activity of 7-hydroxy-4’,6-dimethoxyisoflavone on gGAPDH. All these data support the hypothesis that highly oxygenated flavones possess the structural requirements to inhibit gGAPDH. The family Meliaceae is characterized by the frequent occurrence of limonoids (da Silva et al., 1984). This class of compounds has been attracted considerable interest because of their biological properties and diversity of structures (Champagne et al., 1992). Previous studies of C. fissilis showed the isolation of limonoids and triterpenes (Taylor, 1984; Zelnik, 1966, 1970; Leite et al., 2005a; Ambrozin et al., 2006) and C. fruticosa has been reported to contain ent-clerodanes and labdanes diterpenoids (Rojatkar and Nagasampagi, 1994; Rojatkar et al., 1994), limonoids, steroids, sesquiterpenoids, heneicosene derivatives and one coumarin (Luo et al., 2000, 2001; Leite et al., 2005a,b). There are no phytochemical studies about T. ramalhoi, but several compounds have been isolated from the Trichilia genus, such as, limonoids (Cortez et al., 1992; Garcez et al., 1997; Garcez, et al., 2000; Cortez et al., 2000), lignan glycosides (Cortez et al., 1998), w-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids (Pupo et al., 1996), terpenoids, steroids (Pupo et al., 2002; Pupo et al., 1996) and g-lactones (Pupo et al., 1998). Phytochemical studies with other active extracts from these plants are in progress and shall reveal molecules that can be used as potential lead compounds in the search for potent and selective T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitors. In conclusion, most of the active extracts belong to the family Meliaceae. New investigations with these extracts are undertaken in order to find inhibitors that could act as potential lead molecules on the described assay. Moreover, the isolated flavonoids bring about the enzymatic inhibition, showing that these compounds are potential lead molecules for the development of new drugs against Chagas’ disease.

(Rutaceae) permitiu o isolamento de duas substâncias inéditas: 4-metoxi-6-[2-(metilamino)fenil]- 2H-piran-2-ona e acetato de rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hidroxi-3-metil-1-butenil]-4,8-dimetoxi-5,6,7,8- tetraidrofuro[2,3-b]quinolin-7-ila; e dos alcalóides arborinina, N-metil-1-hidroxi-3-metoxiacridona, esquimianina, cocusagina, isodutaduprina, isoesquimianina e isococusagina. Através da análise dos dados espectroscópicos foram estabelecidas as estruturas químicas das substâncias isoladas sendo que para os alcalóides inéditos tais dados são descritos pela primeira vez. Além disso, os ensaios bilógicos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do Trypanosoma cruzi das substâncias isoladas mostraram que elas possuem atividade tripanocida moderada. The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract from leaves of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) afforded two new compounds 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H- pyran-2-one and rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8- tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b]quinoline-7-yl acetate, along with the known compounds arborinine, N-methyl- 1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone, skimmianine, kokusagine, isodutaduprine, isoskimmianine, and isokokusagine. Their structures were established based on their spectral data, and for the new compounds these data are described herein. Additionally, these compounds were assayed on the tripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi showing moderate trypanocidal activity. Keywords: Almeidea rubra, Rutaceae, alkaloids, trypanocidal activity Introduction The genus Almeidea belongs to Rutaceae family and is widely distributed in Brazil. Data about the secondary metabolites of this genus are available. From Almeidea guyanensis was isolated C-arabinosyl flavones, 2- and 4- quinolones, and flavone C-glycosides.1 We have previously reported the isolation of triterpenoids, acridone, 2-quinolone, and furoquinoline alkaloids, and a new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid from A. coeruela and A. rubra2 besides steroids, one sesquiterpene, one cromone, and one flavone.3 Chagas’ disease (American Trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affecting more than 18 million people in Latin America.4 Its treatment is still a challenge and new less toxic and more effective drugs are necessary. As a part of our search for new trypanocidal compounds and our studies on the chemistry of Rutaceae, a new specimen of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. was investigated. Thus, here we report the isolation, identification and characterization of two new substances (1 and 2a) and seven known compounds (3-9) from methanol extract of leaves of this plant, in addition to their trypanocidal activities. Results and Discussion The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of 435 New Pyrone and Quinoline Alkaloid from Almeidea rubra and their Trypanocidal Activity Vol. 16, No. 3A, 2005 methanol extract from leaves of A. rubra afforded two new compounds (1 and 2a) and known compounds (Figure 1) arborinine (3), N-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone (4),5 skimmianine (5),6 kokusagine (6),7 isodutaduprine (7),8 isoskimmianine (8), and isokokusagine (9), which were identified through comparison of their NMR spectral data with the literature. Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow powder and its structure was determined by analysis of NMR and LRMS. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed aromatic protons at δ 7.33 (2H, m), and 6.70 (2H, m), assigned to H-4’, H-6’, and H-3’, H5’, respectively. Two olefinic protons (H-3 and H-5) appeared at δ 5.49, and 6.23 (d, J 2.2 Hz) assigned to an 2- pyrone by comparison with a styryl-2-pyrone described by Pizzolatti et al.,9 besides broad N-H and N-CH3 signals at δ 5.36, and 2.87. Furthermore, a singlet at δ 3.85 (3H) revealed the presence of the methoxyl group in the molecule. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 13 carbons, distinguished as 5 quaternaries (δ 171.7, 164.0, 162.8, 147.6, 116.0), 4 aromatics (δ 132.3, 129.2, 116.4, 111.2), 2 ofelinics (δ 100.1, 87.3), 1 methoxyl (δ 55.9), and 1 N- methyl carbon (δ 30.4). The analysis of 13C NMR and HSQC spectrum allowed us to attribute undoubtedly all chemical shifts to methyl, vinyl, and aromatic carbons/ hydrogens of 1 (Table 1). The assignments of quaternary carbons were possible from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-2’ was deduced from 3J correlation between N-CH3 hydrogens (δ 2.87) and one carbon at δ 147.6. C-4 (δ 171.7) was assigned through 3J correlation between the lowerfield carbon and methoxyl hydrogens (δ 3.85). Furthermore, C-6 (δ 162.8) and C-1’ (δ 116.0) were determined through 2J-3J correlation to H-5 (δ 6.23). Finally, through the 2J correlation between H-3 (δ 5.49) and a carbonyl carbon at δ 164.0 was attributed C-2. All these results allowed us to propose the structure 4- methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one for compound 1, which is described for the first time in the literature and represents a new class of compounds formed by the reaction of anthranilic acid and two acetyl/malonyl- CoA units. Single crystal X-ray diffraction established undoubtedly the structure of 1 as a derivative of anthranilic acid (Figure 2). The crystal structure of compound 1 shows the presence of two independent molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure 2). The main conformational difference between both independent molecules is centered in the dihedral angle between the least square planes that pass through the aromatic rings in each molecule. The value of this angle in molecule 1 is 33.58(8)° and in molecule 2 is 34.79(8)°. The crystal structure also shows the presence of one intramolecular interaction in each molecule. These interactions are slightly different due to the conformation Figure 1. Compounds isolated from Almeidea rubra. Table 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. changes. The analyses of the crystal packing show the presence of four intermolecular interactions of the type C- H…O that give rise to the formation of chains along the (101) direction. These chains are connected with the chain just above and below it through three intermolecular interactions of the N-H…O type. The quinoline and acridine alkaloids, which are widely distributed in Rutaceae, arise from combination of anthranilic acid and acetate/malonate.10 In these cases, the ciclization takes place by nucleophilic attack of nitrogen atom to the carboxyl carbon. However, compound 1 should be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom to the carboxyl carbon, giving rise an α-pyrone. We have previously reported the isolation of the new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid 2b (Figure 1) from A. coerulea.2 Reinvestigation of A. rubra afforded an alkaloid 2a whose spectral data seem to be very similar to those of 2b. This alkaloid was isolated as a white powder and identified by NMR and LRMS. The molecular formula C20H25NO6 of 2a was defined by elemental analysis. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2a were observed a pair of doublets (J 2.6 Hz) at δ 7.58 and 6.97, and a singlet at δ 4.30, which indicate that 2a was a tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid. The signals at δ 2.78, 2.20, and 2.01, assigned to H-5, and H-6, respectively, confirmed that 2a had a reduced furoquinoline ring. 1H NMR spectrum of 2a also showed two singlets at δ 3.14, and 2.03, and a group of signals at δ 6.06 (d, J 16.1 Hz), 5.69 (d, J 16.1 Hz), 1.34 (s), and 1.31 (s), which indicated the presence of the 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent. Through the spectral data comparison, it was established that 2a distinguished from 2b by the presence of 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent instead of γ,γ-dimethylallyl moiety. Analysis of HSQC correlations and literature data2 allowed us to attribute undoubtedly chemical shifts to methyl, methylene, vinyl, furanyl hydrogen/carbon of 2a (Table 2). The assignments of quaternary carbons of 2a were made from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-4 was deduced from 3J correlation between methoxyl hydrogens at C-4 (δ 4.30) and one carbon at δ 158.2. The correlation of the other methoxyl hydrogens (δ 3.14) and one carbon at δ 79.7 determined Figure 2. ORTEP-3 diagram of compound 1. Table 2.

C-4a was assigned through correlation between the carbon at δ 117.6 and H-5, and H-6 (δ 2.78, and 2.01). H-5 also correlated to C-8a (δ 150.0). Furthermore, methyl hydrogens at δ 1.34, and 1.31, correlated with an oxygenated carbon at δ 70.8, establishing C-3”. Finally, the correlation between furanyl hydrogens (δ 7.58, and 6.97) and quaternary carbons at δ 162.7, and 105.2 determined C-2, and C-3, respectively. The close similarity between the chemical shifts observed for carbons of reduced furoquinoline ring when compared with the model compound 7-O-acetylha- plophyllidine (2b)2 led us to suggest a trans relationship between the 7-acetoxy and 8-methoxy groups. Alkaloid 2a, rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]- 4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro [2,3-b]quinoline-7- yl acetate, is described for the first time in the literature, and the occurrence of tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid such as 2a and 2b seems to be restricted to the genera Almeidea and Haplophyllum of Rutaceae family.2,11 In order to improve the therapy of Chagas disease, we have been studying species of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, Burseraceae, and Cneoraceae) aiming to isolate hit compounds that could be used in the development of new antichagasic drugs. Compounds described in this paper were isolated from an active fraction of A. rubra (62.9% lysis – percent reduction of the parasite number) on the tripomastigote forms of T. cruzi.12 Their in vitro trypanocidal actions are shown on Table 3. Three of them (7-9) could not be assayed due to their instability. The results showed that all of compounds had moderate trypanocidal actions and kokusagine (6) was the most active one. Probably, they are responsible by the activity of the A. rubra fraction.12 However, they could not be considered good prototype for the development of new antichagasic drugs, mainly when their activities are compared with crystal violet and some lignans also isolated from other Rutaceae.13 Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using either Bruker DRX-200 and ARX- 400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Low resolution EIMS were recorded on GC-17A, GCMS-QP5000 Shimadzu. Plant material The leaves of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. were collected in May 2000 in Espírito Santo State, southeast of Brazil. The plant material was identified by Dr. José Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani et al. 4746) was deposited at the Herbarium of that Department. Extraction and isolation Dried leaves (313.5 g) were extracted first with hexane and then with MeOH at room temp. Part of the methanol extract (15.9 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel 60 (70- 230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield the corresponding fractions (ALFMH, ALFMD, ALFMA, ALFMM). The fraction ALFMA (3.3208 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 410 x 43 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give eleven fractions. The second fraction (ALFMA2; 0.6302 g) was chromatographed on silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 358 x 31 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:AcOEt 8:2→MeOH) to afford ten fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) from the fraction five (ALFMA2,5; 103.6 mg) was obtained four fractions. Then, the second fraction (ALFMA2,5,2; 68.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2→MeOH gradient) to give four fractions. The third fraction (ALFMA2,5,2,3; 36.0 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (1:1) to afford six fractions. Through column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2→MeOH gradient) of the fraction five (ALFMA2,5,2,3,5; 14.3 mg) was isolated the alkaloid 2a (2.6 mg). Fraction four (ALFMA4; 178.1 mg) was chroma- tographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) Table 3.

Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) of the third fraction (ALFMA4,3; 59.9 mg) was obtained the alkaloid 5 (ALFMA4,3,7; 2.5 mg) and eight fractions. Then, the fourth fraction (ALFMA4,3,4; 2.3 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (332 x 25 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) to give three fractions. Further purification of the fraction two (ALFMA4,3,4,2; 2.0 mg) on preparative planar silica plate with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) afforded alkaloid 6 (1.6 mg). Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH) of the fraction five (ALFMA4,3,5; 21.5 mg) was isolated the compound 1 (14.7 mg). The alkaloids arborinine (3) (43.2 mg), isodutaduprine (7) (25.6 mg), and isoskimmianine (8) (28.8 mg) were crystallized in MeOH from fraction six (ALFMA6; 104.5 mg), seven (ALFMA7; 317.3 mg) and nine (ALFMA9; 120.5 mg), respectively. The other alkaloid isokokusagine (9) (32.1 mg) was purified on sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH) from fraction eight (ALFMA8; 90.3 mg), and the alkaloid 4 (3.2 mg) was obtained from fraction three (148.8 mg). 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one (1) Yellow powder; elemental analysis (Found: C, 68.0432; H, 5.565904; N, 6.11885.

Single crystal X-ray analysis Low temperature X-ray diffraction data collection was performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 50° in 2θ, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;14 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.15 No absorption corrections were applied. The structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.16 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.17 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. The programs SHELXL-97,17 and ORTEP-318 were used within WinGX19 to prepare materials for publication. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles, and thermal parameters have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. The supplementary crystallographic data have been sent in electronic format to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, as CIF file No. CCDC 242119.

Trypanocidal activity in vitro As described by Ambrozin et al.,12 the bioassays were carried out using blood of infected Swiss albino mice, which was collected by cardiac puncture at the peak of parasitemic infection (7th day of infection for Y strain of T. cruzi). The infected blood was diluted with healthy mice blood to achieve a concentration of 2.106 forms/mL. Solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The activities of substances were evaluated at 500, 250, and 100 µg/mL. The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) which contained 400 µL mixture/ well. The plates were incubated at 4 oC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h, following the method described by Brener.20 Infected blood with the same volume of DMSO was used as control, and gentian violet to a concentration of 250 µg/mL was used as positive control. The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 values were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

As frações foram monitoradas via RMN 1H e ESI-EM/EM e foram analisadas somente aquelas cujos espectros apresentavam características de alcalóides do ácido antranílico e flavonóides não isolados anteriormente. Foram isolados do caule os alcalóides flindersina, skimmianina, 8-metoxiflindersina e dictamnina; das folhas os flavonóides 3',4',7,8-tetrametoxi-5,6- (2\",2\"-dimetilpirano)-flavona, 3',4',5,7,8-pentametoxiflavona, 5-hidroxi-3',4',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona, 3',4'-metilenodioxi-5,6,7-trimetoxiflavona e 5-hidroxi-3',4'-metilenodioxi-6,7-dimetoxiflavona,. Os alcalóides do ácido antranílico não foram encontrados em dez anos. Vários flavonóides isolados de N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, enxerto de Citrus sinensis (Rutaceae) e Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) foram testados frente a gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de Trypanosoma cruzi, visando verificar seus potenciais em inibir a atividade da enzima. Os flavonóides polimetoxilados e um isoflavonóide foram os mais ativos. Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated an investigation of N. paraensis searching for alkaloids. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR and ESI-MS/MS and only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. Stems afforded the alkaloids flindersine, skimmianine, 8-methoxyflindersine and dictamnine; leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethoxy-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone, 3',4',5,7,8- pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethoxyflavone, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. A number of flavonoids isolated from N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, Citrus sinensis graft (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma cruzi. Highly oxygenated flavones and isoflavone were the most actives. Keywords: Rutaceae, Leguminosae, Neoraputia, Murraya, Citrus, Lonchocarpus, Trypanosoma cruzi, alkaloid, flavonoids, chemosystematic Introduction Neoraputia species were originally described by Engler as species of Raputia Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus Neoraputia Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them from Raputia and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae.1 Previous investigations of Neoraputia reported the presence of eleven polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-flavones, one 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)- flavone and one flavanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich;2,3 five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'- hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6'-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-polymethoxylated chalcones from N. 381 Enzymatic Inhibition Studies of Selected Flavonoids Vol. 14, No. 3, 2003 magnifica var. magnifica (Engler) Emmerich;4,5 ten polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-flavones and one 6-(3”-hydroxy,3”-methyl- trans-but-1”-enyl)-flavone from N. paraensis.6,7 All phytochemical studies on Neoraputia genus have been undertaken in our laboratory and by Arruda et al.6,7, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. If Emmerich’proposal is correct, that Neoraputia is a Cusparieae member, then this genus can be regarded as a potential source of anthranilate alkaloids. Thus, it would be not surprising if anthranilate alkaloids had remained undiscovered in the Neoraputia because of their low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove Neoraputia to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated flavones.4,8 Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of Neoraputia species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. In order to establish this we have now undertaken a further investigation of N. paraensis. Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organisation). Control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side effects.9 The bloodstream form of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production.9 This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined.9 Glyceraldehyde- 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with significant differences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested.9 Highly oxygenated flavones from Neoraputia magnifica have shown to be the most actives as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor.5 These data stimulated an investigation of other flavonoids. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, flavonoids isolated from Neoraputia paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limon (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. Results and Discussion Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated an investigation of the extracts from stems and leaves of N. paraensis searching for alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on TLC plates. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations. The dichloromethane extract from stems afforded only the alkaloid flindersine (1).10 The HSQC and HMBC experiments on flindersine, permitted minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments.10 Table 1 shows that the signals for C-3 and C-10 to C-12 were reassigned. The observed correlations between the methine hydrogen signal at δ 6.77 and the 13C signals at δ 162.5, 157.3 and 79.1 led to their assignments as C-2, C-4, C-13, respectively. The upfield methine hydrogen signal at δ 5.56 showed correlation with the 13C signals at δ 105.8, 79.1 and 26.3 permitting the assignment of these signals to C-3, C-13 and C-14/15, respectively. The signals at δ 6.77 and 5.56 were then assigned to H-11 and H-12, respectively. The methanolic extract from stems afforded skimmianine,11 8-methoxyflindersine (2)12 and dictamnine.13,14 As no carbon shifts of 2 could be found in the literature, these data are listed in Table 1. Complete and unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for 2 were made using the HSQC and HMBC techniques and using 1 and haplophytin A (3)15 as a models. The methine hydrogen signal at δ 6.71 showed correlation with the 13C signals at δ 157.1 permitting the assignment of these signals to H-11 and C-4. Thus, in compound 1 and 2, H-11 is more deshielded than H-12. However, in model 3 the presence of the methoxyl at C-5 caused downfield shift of the usual range for 4,O-3-chromene quinolines, resulting in the H-12 being more deshielded than H-11. The methoxyl at C-5 also induces effects on C-10 and C-3, exhibiting upfield displacement for C-10 and downfield displacement for C-3. These data were also confirmed by HMBC experiments.15 The n-hexane extract of the leaves yielded 3',4',7,8- tetramethoxy-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone3 (4) which has not been recorded from N. paraensis. The dichloromethane extract from leaves gave four flavonoids, 382 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone16 (5), 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7- tetramethoxyflavone17 (6), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone5 (7) and 8, which are reported for the first time from N. paraensis, while the latter appears to be new. The flavone 8 exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3',4'-substitution (δ 7.33, d, J 1.8 Hz, H-2'; δ 6.93, d, J 8.2 Hz, H-5'; δ 7.46, dd, J 8.2 and 1.8 Hz, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for two methoxy groups (δ 3.97, s; 3.92, s), one methylenedioxy group (δ 6.08, s, 2H), one hydroxyl group at δ 12.73 (1H, s, OH-5) and two singlets at δ 6.54 (H-8) and 6.55 (H-3) indicating the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted and a flavone nucleus. The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)17 fragments in ESI-MS/MS of this flavone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B- rings. Thus, a combination of 1H NMR data and the fragment ions at m/z 146 (30%) and 181 (RDA-Me, 100%) fully supported the presence of 3',4'-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy or 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-OH-7,8- and 5-OH- 6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-OH-3,7,8- and 5-OH-3,6,7- trimethoxyflavonol indicated that C-6 methine (ca. δ 96) resonates at lowerfield than C-8 methine (ca. δ 91).18 Thus, Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts for alkaloids 1, 2 and model 3 1 a 2 a 3 a Atom δC δH m HMBC δC δH m HMBC δC δH m J 1H → 13C J 1H → 13C J 2 162.5 160.5 162.4 3 105.8 106.2 115.7 4 157.3 157.1 156.0 5 122.6 7.89 d 157.3 114.6 7.46 dd 110.3 155.0 (7.5) 137.2 (8.0, 1.0) 127.9 130.8 6 122.2 7.19 t 115.4 121.7 7.10 t 115.7 103.5 (7.5) (8.0) 145.5 7 130.8 7.48 t 137.2 110.3 6.94 dd 114.6 120.5 (7.5) 122.6 (8.0, 1.0) 127.9 8 115.9 7.33 d 122.2 145.5 117.4 (7.5) 115.4 9 137.2 127.9 132.9 10 115.4 115.7 106.5 11 117.2 6.77 d 79.1 117.3 6.71 d 79.1 126.2 5.54 d (9.9) 157.3 (9.9) 157.1 (9.9) 162.5 12 126.2 5.56 d 26.3 126.2 5.52 d 79.1 117.5 6.76 d (9.9) 79.1 (9.9) 106.2 (9.9) 105.8 13 79.1 79.1 79.0 14/15 26.3 1.54 s 28.1 1.52 s 28.0 N-H - 11.5 s - 8.87 s OMe - - 56.0 3.95 s 55.7 a (in CDCl3).

From these data 8 was characterised as 5-hydroxy-3',4'- methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy- flavone (9)18 and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxy- flavone (10).5 Preliminary work was firstly undertaken on specimens collected in Paragominas, state of Pará, north of Brazil, in February 1991.6,7 The present results obtained from specimens originating from Uruçuca, Bahia (February 1993), showed that there was no difference in the flavonoids between the two collections. However, alkaloids were obtained only from plants of northeast region (Bahia), which is characterized by drought summer, compared to rainy summer in the northern (Pará). In contrast, Neoraputia alba and N. magnifica collected in Espirito Santo, near northeast of Brazil, had only high concentration of flavonoids. Thus, geographic-variation do not seem to be an important environmental factor. The low concentration of anthranilate alkaloids is likely to be responsible for the alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. All alkaloids were obtained in very small amounts (1-3 mg), only flindersine (1) was present in substantial amounts (10 mg). In a previous paper concerning the chemical systematics of Cusparieae, which Neoraputia has been assigned,8 the importance of coumarins and anthranilate alkaloids was highlighted. This study brings into focus polyoxygenated flavonoids as another taxonomically useful chemical marker in this group. Many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds presents in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far. A number of flavonoids isolated from Neoraputia paraensis, N. magnifica,4,5 Murraya paniculata,19 Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limon20 (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus21 (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. The positive results are summarized at Table 3 and the occurrence of flavonoids evaluated at Table 4. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 65% when 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethoxy-5',6'-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)chalcone (11) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1, suggesting that chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The flavones 3',4',5',5,7- pentamethoxyflavone (12), 3',4',5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone (13), 4',5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (14) and flavonol 3’,4’,5’,3,5,6,7-heptamethoxyflavonol (15) completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 99-100%) at 100 µg mL-1. The activity does not appear to be affected by the introduction of the 3-OMe substituent into the flavone Table 3.

However, the activity of 3’,4’,5’,3,5,7,8- heptamethoxyflavonol (16) was comparable to that of 15 but, reducing the enzymatic activity by 88% at 100 µg mL-1. This finding shows that the activity varies with the position of methoxyl group. The higher activity of 12, 13, 14 and 15 could possibly be attributed to a greater symmetry of electron density of the molecules. Flavones 3',4'-methylenedioxy- 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (10) and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone (7) do not display significant GAPDH activity (26% and 36%, respectively) showing that 3',4'- methylenedioxy reduce drastically inhibitory activity. Differences between polyoxygenated flavones and isoflavone afrormosine (17) inhibitory activities are not significant, indicating that the presence of many methoxy groups in isoflavones are not a requirement for activity. However, isoflavone possess 3-phenylchromone skeleton and it may be incorrect to compare it with the other flavones tested. GAPDH activity was also inhibited by 96% when auronol derriobtusone A (18) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1. 385 Enzymatic Inhibition Studies of Selected Flavonoids Vol. 14, No. 3, 2003 Thus, clearly isoflavonoids and auronoids deserve more attention as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase- inhibitors. Highly oxygenated flavones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal GAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavonoids and the enzyme GAPDH.

Plant material Neoraputia paraensis was collected in Uruçuca, Bahia, Brazil, and a voucher (SPF 81-316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociências, USP, São Paulo. Isolation of compounds Ground stems (2700 g) and leaves (409 g) of Neoraputia paraensis were extracted with n-hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. Only the concentrated extracts containing alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on thin- layer chromatography plates, were worked. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations. The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from stem was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel. Elution with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1:0.2) afforded 16 fractions. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 1 (10 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The concentrated CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography over silanized silica elution with MeOH-H2O (1:1) afforded 10 fractions. Fraction 8 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient affording 2 fractions. Fraction 1 was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH (5:0.4:0.4) and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH (4.6: 0.6:0.4) affording skimmianine (3 mg). Fraction 2 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 Å pore diameter; eluant: CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1); flow rate: 4.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, λ 254 nm) to give 2 (second peak, 1.2 mg) and dictamnine (first peak, 1.0 mg), after four cycles of 80 min. The concentrated n-hexane extract of the leaves was four times flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc- MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc gradient, and finally with silica gel and Florisil (1:1) eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 (20 mg). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shodex Asahipack GS- 310P; eluant: MeOH; flow rate: 5.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, λ 240 nm) to give 8 (second peak, 2.7 mg), after three cycles of 60 min. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 also were purified by R-HPLC (as above; flow rate: 6.0 mL min-1) to give 5 (second peak, 5.0 mg), 6 (second peak, 4.0 mg) and 7 (second peak, 3.0 mg) after three cycles of 60 min, respectively. 5-Hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone (8).

T. cruzi GAPDH-activity TcGAPDH activity was determined according to a 386 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. modification of a previously reported procedure.23 Reduced NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 30s interval. The reaction medium was 50 mmol L-1 Tris- HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 β- mercapto-ethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD+, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 4-9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 µL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The specific activity (unit = U) of the enzyme was calculated as: (U mg-1) = {(∆ absorbance/∆ t) x volume of cell}/6.22 x volume of enzyme x [ enzyme] where ∆t = 0.5 min; volume of cell = 1.00 mL; εNADH = 6.22 (mmol L-1)-1 cm-1; volume of enzyme = 0.005 mL; [enzyme] concentration of enzyme in mg mL-1. T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity The inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 µL. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30s interval. Flavonoids were tested at 50 and 100 µg mL-1 in 10% DMSO using 5 µL of GAPDH at 0.90 mg mL-1. In each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO in the reaction medium and was used as the positive control. The specific activity of TcGAPDH was not significantly affected by the presence of 10% DMSO. Data were means of 3 repetitions and values as percent of control were used as follows: % inhibitory activity = {(U mg-1 control – U mg-1 compound)/U mg-1 control} x 100 Enzymatic inhibition studies have been carried out in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. Some of the potentially active substances, as flavones 6 and 8, can not be assayed with the standard procedure described here, due to problems of solubility in the reaction buffer and absorption of light close to the wavelength used to observe the reaction course (340 nm). To overcome these limitations an alternative technique is being developed, based on calorimetric measurements, similar to procedures adopted with other enzymes.24 Acknowledgements The authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvol- vimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES).

VIEIRA* and ISAO KUBO Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natural Resources, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. (Received in revised form 12 August 1989) Key Word Index--G&pea bracteata; Rutaceae; stems; quinoline alkaloids; plant growth inhibitor; molluscicidal activity. Abstract-Four quinoline alkaloids were isolated from stems of Gnlipea bracteata. In addition to one new compound, 2-(3’,4’-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)-quinoline, three were identified as the known compounds 2+propylquinoline, 2- n-pentylquinoline and 2-(l’-pentenyl)-quinoline. However, this is the first report of their isolation from a natural source. All alkaloids showed an inhibitory effect on shoot and root growth of lettuce (Lactuca satiua). Three of them also showed molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis. INTRODUCTION The Rutaceae is represented by a great number of species in tropical areas. Many of these species have never been the target of a phytochemical investigation. In our con- tinuing effort to find biologically active compounds we have investigated G&pea bracteata. In this paper we report the isolation and identification of one new alkaloid and three known ones from G. bracteata collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The growth inhibitory effect against lettuce of the alkaloids, as well as, their molluscicidal activity are also described. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The dichloromethane extract of the stems of G. bracteata afforded four alkaloids 14. The combination of various routine ‘H, 13C NMR and mass spectrometric analyses allowed us to attribute the formulas C,,H,,N. C,,H,,N. C,,H,,N and C,,H,,NO, to compounds 14, respect- ively. ‘H NMR (Table 1) showed signals of six aromatic protons for all compounds at 67.24 f0.04, d, J= 8.5 Hz, H-3; 68.02kO.02 d, J=8.5 Hz, H-4; 67.74kO.02, dd, .I =7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-5; 67.47+0.04, td, J=7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-6; S7.66kO.04, td, J=7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-7 and 68.01 +O.Ol, d, .I = 7.8, H-8. An exception was the signal corresponding to H-3 of compound 3 at 67.51. The similarities of the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the four compounds suggest that a 2-substituted quinoline system is the structural basis for all compounds, and that the difference between them is the type of substituent attached to C-2. Compound 1 possesses a n-propyl moiety characterized by the signals in the ‘HNMR at 62.91 (t), 61.81 (sext, J * Permanent address: Departamento de Quimica, Universi- dade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, CEP 13560, Brazil. = 7.4 Hz), 60.91 (t), integrating 2: 2: 3, respectively. Con- firmation of this unit can be taken from the 13CNMR signals at 641.30,23.25 and 13.99, which can be attributed to C-l’, C-2’ and C-3’, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are very closely related to each other and to compound 1. The mass spectra showed the parent peak at m/z 199 and 197 for 2 and 3 respectively, indicating that the difference between 2 and 3 is two hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the ‘H NMR of both com- pounds showed that 2 has two more signals in the olefinic region C66.80 (td) and 66.70 (d)] than 3 and revealed the presence of a trans-substituted double bond in 3. The signal of four aliphatic protons at 61.30 (m) for 2 was observed, which corresponds to two methylene carbons. The 13CNMR for compounds 2 and 3 showed 14 signals. For 2 there were five signals at high field indi- cating a n-pentyl moiety. However, for 3 there were only three signals in this region. These data indicate that 2 has a n-pentyl chain attached to C-2 and that 3 has the corresponding pentenyl chain. Compound 4 is related to the three compounds de- scribed above. Analysis of its ‘H and 13CNMR spectra reveals that, in addition to the quinoline ring, there is another aromatic ring present in the molecule. The tri- substituted nature of this ring is confirmed by the signals 66.72 (d, 5=1.2 Hz), 66.69 (d, J=7.8 Hz), 66.65 (dd, J 1 R=\\;f\\ 3 813 814 P. C. WEIRA and I.

The presence of a piperonyl moiety is once more confirmed by the mass spectrum which show- ed a peak at m/z 135. The parent peak of m/z 217 requires a methylenedioxyphenylethyl as the substituent of this quinoline. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. The compounds 2- methyl (5) and 2-aminoquinoline (6) were used as models c121. The alkaloids isolated showed inhibitory effects on the growth of lettuce seedlings and molluscicidal activity as determined according to the methods described pre- viously [3,4]. All compounds at concentrations larger than 500ppm inhibited both shoot and root growth in the lettuce test. At lower concentrations their activities were diminished. When the concentration was decreased to 100 ppm, only compounds 3 and 4 showed activity but at this concentration. 1 and 2 had no activity. Molluscicidal activity was exhibited by compounds 2-4. Compound 1 was not molluscicidal even at 100 ppm. Compound 4 had the most powerful molluscicidal activ- ity killing snails at a concentration of only 5 ppm. Com- pounds 2 and 3 possessed activities at 20 and 10 ppm, respectively. Our results suggest that the presence of a second aromatic ring at C-2 increases the activity of the com- pounds, and that the activity of 2-alkylquinolines de- pends on the length of the alkyl chain. It is important to note that very few examples of naturally occurring alka- loids have been found to exhibit molluscicidal activity [S]. although recently, some potent molluscicidal alka- loids were isolated from members of the Meliaceae [S]. It is also important to mention that few species of the genus Gu/ipeu have been studied. However, in a unique example presented by Mester [7], the alkaloids isolated were 7- substituted quinolines. We suspect that there should be a tendency for this genus to produce this class of com- pound. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of constituents. Galipea hracteata was collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil; a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Institute de Biociencias. USP, Sao Paulo. Dried stems (920 g) were extd with CH,CI, at room temp. for 4 days. The ext was evapd to dryness yielding (5.567 g) ofcrude extract. A portion of this ext (1.463 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (50 g) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH,CI,, EtOAc and MeOH). Alkaloids were found in frs 16.-35. They were then sepd by low pressure chromatography on silica gel (Lichroprep) using hexane-EtOAc (49: l), affording I (31 mg), 2 (IOmg). 3 (15 mg) and 4 (I 13 mg).

São espécies típicas do Cer- rado, sendo encontradas preferencialmente no Cerrado stricto sen- so, mas também ocorrem em florestas com clima quente e úmido, como a Floresta Amazônica2. Todos os representantes de Tocoyena são árvores de pequeno porte ou arbustos. Este gênero pertence à subfamília Ixoroideae, tribo Gardenieae-Gardeniineae, sendo os iridóides considerados seu principal marcador quimiotaxonômico3. Investigações fitoquímicas previamente realizadas por nosso gru- po sobre Rubiaceae, em particular T. formosa, conduziu ao isola- mento de iridóides glicosilados e não glicosilados, uma saponina triterpênica derivada do ácido quinóvico e um flavanol glicosilado4,5. Além de iridóides, a subfamília é conhecida por metabolizar flavonóides, triterpenos, derivados fenólicos e alcalóides do tipo emetínicos, quinolínicos e poliindolenínicos1. Tocoyena brasiliensis Mart., conhecida popularmente como genipapinho6, não apresenta registro de trabalhos sobre sua compo- sição química. Ensaios preliminares, objetivando a detecção de subs- tâncias com atividade antifúngica, indicaram para o extrato cloro- fórmico das folhas desta espécie atividade fraca contra o fungo filamentoso Cladosporium cladosporioides. O presente trabalho des- creve o isolamento e identificação de duas misturas binárias de saponinas triterpênicas e um flavonóide glicosilado. As misturas das saponinas 1+2 e 3+4 apresentaram atividade moderada contra o fun- go C. cladosporioides. As estruturas das substâncias foram estabe- lecidas com base na análise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo fitoquímico das folhas de T. brasiliensis resultou na separação de duas misturas binárias de saponinas triterpênicas, a primeira contendo o ácido 3-O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-quinóvico7 (1) e o ácido-3-O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-cinchólico (2) e a se- gunda, o ácido 3-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo-quinóvico8 (3) e o ácido 28-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo quinóvico9 (4). A saponina identificada como o ácido 3-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo-quinóvico8 (3) e o flavonóide ramanzina-3-O-rutinosídeo10 (5) também foram isola- dos como substâncias puras neste estudo. As estruturas dos compostos isolados foram caracterizadas a partir da análise dos dados espectroscópicos (RMN de 1H e 13C, DEPT 135, COSY 1H-1H, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY 1D) e por comparação com os dados disponíveis na literatura. As quatro saponinas triterpênicas isoladas apresentaram como padrão comum os C-27 e C-28 oxidados como grupo carboxílico. A ocorrência do grupo carboxila no C-27 foi evidenciada princi- palmente pela diferença ∆δ no C-14 de aproximadamente + 13,0 ppm, quando comparado com a α-amirina (C-14 ≈ δ 42,0)11. A diferença de deslocamento químico deste carbono é decorrente do efeito α da carboxila (C-27) em C-14. Assim, os esqueletos triterpênicos das saponinas isoladas foram identificados como de- rivados do ácido quinóvico12 ou do ácido cinchólico12, bastante dis- cutidos e analisados na literatura. A ocorrência da mistura binária das saponinas 1+2 foi eviden- ciada no espectro de RMN de 1H pelos sinais em δ 5,49 (m) e 602 Quim. Nova Hamerski et al. 5,45 (m) atribuídos aos átomos de hidrogênio olefínicos (H-12). O espectro de RMN de 13C mostrou sinais para dois esqueletos triterpênicos, sendo estes sinais análogos aos observados para áci- do quinóvico12 e ácido cinchólico12. No espectro de RMN de 13C foram observados os sinais em δ 128,1 (C-12), 132,8 (C-13), 55,5 (C-14), 53,8 (C-18), 38,6 (C-19), 36,2 (C-20), 176,9 (C-27), 178,8 (C-28), 18,2 (C-29) e 21,2 (C-30), que caracterizaram o esqueleto triterpênico do ácido quinóvico. Para o ácido cinchólico foram observados no espectro de RMN de 13C os sinais em δ 125,1 (C-12), 136,8 (C-13), 55,4 (C-14), 43,2 (C-18), 43,0 (C-19), 30,5 (C-20), 176,4 (C-27), 178,6 (C-28), 33,2 (C-29) e 23,5 (C-30) (Ta- bela 1). No espectro de RMN de 1H pode-se identificar a presença de dois monossacarídeos por meio de seus átomos de hidrogênio anoméricos em δ 4,13 (d, J = 7,5) e 4,12 (d, J = 7,9), que foram correlacionados no mapa de contorno gHMQC aos átomos de car- bono anoméricos em δ 105,2 e 105,3, respectivamente. A presença de metila em δ 1,10 (d, J = 6,0) no espectro de RMN de 1H e δ 18,1 no espectro de RMN de 13C sugeriu a presença de uma unidade de raminose, porém os valores dos deslocamentos químicos para os átomos de carbono não eram compatíveis aos observados para esse açúcar. No espectro de experimento COSY 1H-1H foram observa- das as correlações entre os hidrogênios carbinólicos, que foram atribuídas inequivocamente aos seus respectivos carbonos pelo es- pectro de experimento gHMQC. As constantes de acoplamento observadas para os H-1’ (J = 7,5), H-2’ (J = 9,0), H-3’ (J = 9,0) e H-4’ (J = 9,0) para ambas as unidades do açúcar indicaram a dispo- sição diaxial dos átomos de hidrogênio do carboidrato (Tabela 2). Adicionalmente, o espectro de gHMBC apresentou correlações entre o H-6’ (δ 1,10 d, J = 6,0) com os C-5’ (δ 75,5) e C-4’ (δ 71,3); o H- 2’ (δ 2,94 m) com o C-1’(δ 105,2). A associação destes dados ali- ados aos obtidos da literatura permitiram identificar a unidade de açúcar como a β-D-quinovose. A posição da unidade do açúcar no C-3 foi determinada pela correlação a longa distância, observada no mapa de contorno gHMBC entre o H-1’ e o C-3 (δ 88,1). Após análise dos espectros de RMN e comparação com os dados da lite- ratura foi possível identificar a substância 1 como ácido 3-O-β-D- quinovopiranosídeo-quinóvico7 e a substância 2 como o ácido-3- O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-cinchólico, inédita na literatura. O espectro de RMN de 13C da substância 3 apresentou sinais que revelaram a presença de uma saponina. Foram observados no espectro de RMN de 13C os sinais em δ 128,0, 132,5, 55,3, 176,3, 178,6 atribuidos aos C-12, C-13, C-14, C-27 e C-28, respectiva- mente, do esqueleto triterpênico. Além do sinal de carbono anomérico em δ 105,6 (C-1’), outros sinais referentes a uma uni- dade glicosídica foram observados. Os deslocamentos químicos destes e dos demais carbonos, com suas respectivas multiplicidades, apresentaram valores concordantes com os da literatura para o áci- do 3-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo-quinóvico8 (3) (Tabela 1). O espectro de RMN de 13C da mistura 3 + 4 apresentou sinais que indicaram se tratar de uma mistura binária de saponinas triterpênicas. Após identificação dos sinais atribuídos para a subs- tância 3 no espectro de RMN de 13C, observaram-se os sinais para um segundo ácido quinóvico12, caracterizado principalmente pelos sinais duplicados em δ 55,3 e 56,2; 53,7 e 53,8 atribuídos aos C-14 (3), C-14 (4), C-18 (3) e C-18 (4), respectivamente. A diferença entre as duas substâncias foi evidenciada pelos valores dos deslo- camentos químicos dos átomos de carbono das unidades de açúca- res. O valor do deslocamento químico do C-1’ (substância 4) em δ 94,0 é observado quando a glicose está ligada ao C-28, conseqüên- cia do efeito de blindagem da carboxila (Tabela 1). O espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D obtido pela irradiação no H-1’ (δ 4,13, d, J = 7,5) da glicose exibiu correlações com os sinais em δ 2,93, 3,02, 3,05 e 3,10 atribuídos respectivamente aos H-2’, H-4’, H-5’ e H-3’ da unidade glicosídica ligada ao C-3, da substância 3. A irra- diação no H-1’ (δ 5,21, d, J = 7,9) gerou um espectro de experi- mento TOCSY 1D onde foram observadas as correlações com os sinais em δ 2,89, 2,99 e 3,12, atribuídos aos H-4’, H-2’ e H-3’, respectivamente, pertencentes à glicose ligada ao C-28 da substân- cia 4. Os dados obtidos com o espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D aliados aos espectros de gHMQC e gHMBC auxiliaram na atribui- ção inequívoca das unidades de glicose. A análise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D e comparação com os descritos na literatura permi- tiram identificar a substância 4 como ácido 28-O-β-D-glucopira- nosídeo quinóvico9. O flavonóide ramanzina-3-O-rutinosídeo (5) foi identificado pela comparação de seus dados espectroscópicos de RMN de 1H e 13C com os registrados na literatura10. A posição da unidade de β- D-glicose no C-3 foi confirmada pela correlação observada no es- pectro de gHMBC entre o H-1” (δ 5,38, d, J = 8,0) e o C-3 (δ 133,5). A posição da metoxila no C-3’ do anel B do flavonóide foi confirmada pela correlação observada entre os átomos de hidrogê- nio da metoxila (δ 3,83, s) e o C-3’ (δ 147,0). A atividade antifúngica detectada na fase clorofórmica das fo- lhas de T. brasiliensis contra o fungo fitopatogênico C. cladosporioides pode ser atribuída à presença de saponinas Tabela 1.

(Rubiaceae) Vol. 28, No. 4 triterpênicas. As substâncias isoladas e identificadas foram submeti- das a novos ensaios antifúngicos, utilizando a técnica da bioauto- grafia13, para se determinar os limites de detecção (quantidade míni- ma da amostra, em µg, necessária para inibir o crescimento do fun- go), sendo utilizados os fungos filamentosos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum (Tabela 3). As misturas (1 + 2) e (3 + 4) apresenta- ram atividade moderada (5 µg/mL) contra C. cladosporioides em comparação com o padrão nistatina (0,5 µg/mL) e não inibiram o crescimento de C. sphaerospermum. Não foi observada atividade antifúngica para a substância 3, este resultado é um indício de que a atividade antifúngica observada para a mistura das saponinas 3 + 4 pode ser atribuída para a saponina 4. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em DMSO-d6, no espectrômetro Bruker AC-200 F e Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrão de referência. Os experimentos TOCSY, COSY, gHMBC e gHMQC foram realizados em espectrômetro Varian Inova 500 e DEPT 135o em espectrômetro Bruker AC-200 F. Os espec- tros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa resolução FISION Modelo VG Platfform II, no modo Eletrospray. Os espectros no IR foram registrados em espectrofo- tômetro Perkin-Elmer 1600 (Series FTIR), em células de KBr. Os espectros no UV foram registrados em espectrofotômetro Perkin- Elmer Lambda 14P UV/VIS. Nas análises por CCDC e CCDP fo- ram utilizadas placas de sílica gel 60 G F254. As placas foram observadas sob luz UV 254-366 nm (Chromatovus) e reveladas com vapores de iodo ressublimado e solução de anisaldeído, segui- da de aquecimento. Nas cromatografias em coluna foram utiliza- das como fase estacionária sílica gel (230-400 mesh), sílica quimi- camente modificada com grupos octadecila (ODS) (Merk) e Sephadex LH-20. Material vegetal As folhas de T. brasiliensis foram coletadas na Estação Ecoló- gica de Itirapina, Itirapina – SP em janeiro de 2000. Uma exsicata encontra-se depositada no Herbário do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente de São Paulo. Extração e isolamento dos constituintes As folhas de T. brasiliensis (2.400 g) foram secas, moídas e submetidas à extração através de maceração com EtOH/H2O (8:2). O extrato EtOH/H2O foi concentrado sobre pressão reduzida ob- tendo-se 210,0 g de extrato bruto, sendo 130,0 g submetidos à par- tição utilizando n-BuOH/H2O (1:1). A fase n-BuOH foi concentra- da à pressão reduzida, novamente solubilizada em MeOH/H2O (9:1) e, em seguida, submetida à partição com hexano (48,3 g), clorofór- mio (11,2 g) e acetato de etila (11,2 g). Uma fração da fase CHCl3 (4,9 g) das folhas foi submetida à cromatografia líquida a vácuo utilizando sílica gel como fase esta- cionária, eluída em gradiente de polaridade [Hex; Hex/CH2Cl2 (8:2) → (4:6); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (95:5) → (6:4); MeOH], da qual foram coletadas 18 frações (70 mL cada). A fração 11 (1,09 g) foi fracionada em coluna de sílica gel eluída com CH2Cl2 /MeOH (9:1), obtendo-se a mistura das saponinas 1+2 (32,4 mg) e a substância 3 (27,0 mg). A subfração 11-B (176,6 mg), oriunda da fração 11, foi submetida a fracionamento em coluna de sílica gel, eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH (8:2), obtendo a mistura das saponinas 3+4 (20,8 mg). O extrato etanólico das folhas (10,0 g) foi solubilizado em EtOH/H2O (6:4) e submetido à cromatografia líquida a vácuo utili- zando sílica de fase modificada (C-18) como fase estacionária e eluída em gradiente de polaridade [MeOH/H2O (2:8) → (6:4), MeOH, CH2Cl2] sendo obtidas 8 frações (100 mL cada). A fração 6 foi submetida a fracionamento em Sephadex LH-20, eluída com MeOH, obtendo-se o flavonóide glicosilado 5 (32,5 mg). Ácido 3-O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-quinóvico (1) Sólido amorfo branco.

Their cytotoxic activities against Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay at several concentrations for 24 h. Activities could be observed for egonol against C6 (IC50 ¼ 3.2 mg/mL) and Hep-2 (IC50 ¼ 3.6 mg/mL) cell lines, and for homoegonol against C6 (IC50 ¼ 4.9 mg/mL) and HeLa (IC50 ¼ 5.3 mg/mL) cells. Keywords: Styrax camporum; Styracaceae; Cytotoxic lignans; MTT assay 1. Introduction Styrax camporum Pohl (Styracaceae), known in Brazil as ‘‘estoraque do campo’’ or ‘‘cuia de brejo’’, grows in the States of Sa˜ o Paulo and Minas Gerais and is popularly used in gastrointestinal diseases [1]. Its reported uses have led to a study of the composition and antiulcer activity of the crude extract of the bark and the trunk [2]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the bark of S. camporum has resulted in the isolation of homoegonol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, sitosterol, vanillin and esters of cinnamic and ferulic acids [3]. The present article deals with the isolation from stems of S. camporum, and the identification and cytotoxicity evaluation of two benzofuran lignans, egonol (1) and homoegonol (2), and one furofuran lignan, ()syringaresinol (3), *Corresponding author.

Lignans are known to possess several biological activities [7–11], including antitumor, e.g., some podophyllotoxin derivatives, currently in clinical use, and cytotoxic, e.g., the benzofuran lignan licarin A which is active against KB cells. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compounds 1–3 against C6, Hep-2 and HeLa human carcinoma cells, the MTT spectrophotometric assay was used. 2. Experimental 2.1. Plant material The stems of S. camporum Pohl were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guac¸ u, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen (Young 07 – SP) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil. 2.2. General experimental procedures Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. 1H, 13C-NMR, DEPT and COSY spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-D6 using TMS as internal standard on a Bruker AC 200 or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS, on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. CC was performed over silica gel 60, 70–230 or 230–400 mesh or Sephadex LH-20 (Merck). TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates with detection pro- vided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and/or by spraying with 2% anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating. 2.3. Extraction and isolation The dried and powdered stems of S. camporum (470.0 g) were extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue (57.2 g) was taken up in aqueous MeOH (MeOH–H2O 80 : 20; 200 mL) and subsequently extracted with hexane. Sufficient water was added to the aqueous methanol fraction to make it up to 60% aqueous MeOH, which was extracted with CHCl3 followed by EtOAc. The CHCl3 fraction (3.8 g) was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane–EtOAc 1 : 1 v/v (A), CHCl3 (B), EtOAc (C), CHCl3–CH3OH 1 : 1 v/v (D), MeOH (E) and H2O (F) (300 mL each). After evaporation, fraction A (370 mg) was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl3–MeOH (98 : 2) and 62 fractions (15 mL each) were collected. Combined fraction 6–15 afforded 1 (34.3 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.26) and the combined fraction 17–18 afforded 2 (11.7 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.50). Fraction C (630 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 19 fractions (10 mL each) were collected. Combined fractions 2–7 (363 mg) were rechromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 52 fractions (3 mL each) were collected. Purification of the combined fractions 31–41 (98 mg) by prep. TLC (eluent CHCl3–MeOH 92 : 8) yielded 3 (5.1 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 320 H.L. Teles et al. Downloaded by [University of California Santa Cruz] at 17:19 28 November 2014 85 : 15, Rf 0.61). All known compounds were identified with the help of UV, IR, MS and NMR, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. 2.4. Cytotoxicity assay Cellular viability in the presence and absence of test compounds was determined using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, Dorset, U.K.) microculture assay [12]. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase reduces MTT to a blue formazan product with an absorbance at 560 nm in DMSO. Cells harvested in the log phase of the growth were counted and seeded (5 104 cells/well in 1 mL) in 48-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37C under 4.3% CO2 to allow cell attachment, cultures of the Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were treated with several test compound concentrations. Three replicate wells were set up for each experimental condition. After another 24 h incubation period, MTT (100 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution) was added, the plate was incubated for 3 h and unreduced MTT was removed. Acid isopropanol (HCl 0.3%; 100 mL) was added to dissolve the blue formazan. The absorbance at 560 nm was read by using a Pharmacia LKB-Ultrospec III spectrophotometer. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of test compound O HO OR2 OR1 OMe 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1' 6' 1'' 2'' 3'' 1 2 -CH2- Me Me R1 R2 O O OMe OMe HO OH OMe MeO 3 1 4 7 9 1' 4' 7' 9' Cytotoxic lignans from the stems of S. camporum 321 Downloaded by [University of California Santa Cruz] at 17:19 28 November 2014 resulting in a 50% reduction of absorbance compared to untreated cells in the MTT assay. Absorbances taken from cells grown in the absence of drugs were taken as 100% cell survival (control). For each compound the percent viability was plotted against concentration and the IC50 (concentration required to reduce viability by 50%) values were calculated for the three cell lines. This experiment was also performed with a positive control anticancer agent: streptonigrin. 3. Results and discussion The isolated lignans: egonol, homoegonol and () syringaresinol were evaluated for their cytotoxicities by the MTT method in the three cell lines: Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma). Each compound was tested at five different concentrations. The concentration–response curves thus generated were used to calculate the IC50 (table 1). The cytotoxic activity was expressed in terms of relative absorbance of drug-treated cells, in comparison to control cells. The results show a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect relationship for all the lignans and all the cell lines evaluated. Significant activities (IC50<10 mg/mL) could be observed for egonol against C6 and Hep-2 cell lines and for homoegonol against C6 and HeLa cells, when compared to the positive control streptonigrin activity (table 1). The activity of egonol against HeLa cells, homoegonol against Hep-2 cells as well as the activity of syringaresinol, the only furofuran neolignan under investigation in this study towards the three cell lines were moderate. It is interesting to note the significant differences of activity related to the lignan structure.

Their structures were determined by spectroscopic/spectrometric data interpretation of 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR and MS experiments. The relative configuration was established by NOESY analysis, while the conformation adopted by these molecules was evaluated through molecular modeling studies and coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. Furthermore, the anxiolytic effects of the E. mulungu aqueous alcoholic crude extract and of the purified alkaloids were evaluated using the elevated T-maze test. There are about 115 known species of Erythrina Mart. (Legu- minoseae, Papilionaceae) in the tropics and subtropics, as well as in some temperate regions of the world,1 and approximately half of them have been studied.2 Phytochemical analyses have demon- strated that these plants accumulate erythrinian alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenes.3-5 Erythrina plant species are widely used in folk medicine to treat different health problems such as agitation, insomnia, and inflammatory processes.2 Previous studies have demonstrated the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the crude extracts of E. senegalensis,6 E. Velutina, and E. mulungu.7 It has been demonstrated that alkaloids isolated from E. americana have anticonvulsant, hypotensive, hypnotic, and analgesic effects.8 The tranquilizer effects of crude alkaloid fractions from E. americana were investigated in a model that provokes aggressive- ness in rats by visual isolation.9 It was observed that crude alkaloids diminished the aggressive behavior, and their effects were similar to the benzodiazepine compound diazepam.9 E. mulungu, popularly known as mulungu, is a medium well- branched tree native to Southern Brazil, where it is appreciated for its beautiful reddish flowers. Since its flowers have the same color of corals, sometimes this species is also called coral tree.10 In popular medicine, a tincture prepared from the leaf or bark decoction from E. mulungu is used to calm agitation and other disorders of the nervous system, i.e., insomnia and depression.11 It has been demonstrated that acute and chronic treatments with aqueous alcoholic extracts from E. mulungu produce anxiolytic-like effects on a specific subset of defensive behavior in rats exposed in the elevated T-maze (ETM) and in the light-dark transition model (LDTM).12,13 These antianxiety effects were similar to that provoked by the well-known anxiolytic compound diazepam.12,13 As part of our research project focusing on phytochemical investigation of medicinal plants with central nervous system activity, we now report the isolation of a new (1) as well as two known (2, 3) erythrinian alkaloids and their anxiolytic properties. Results and Discussion (+)-11R-Hydroxyerythravine (1) was obtained as an amorphous powder and showed a molecular ion [M + H]+ at m/z 316.3681 in its HRESIMS-MS, consistent with the molecular formula C18H21- NO4. The UV spectrum of 1 suggested that it contained a typical aromatic chromophore with maximum absorption at 283.6, 234.7, and 204.7 nm. IR absorption bands at 1615 and 3260 cm-1 indicated the presence of a conjugated system and a hydroxyl group, respectively. The aromatic part of the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited two singlets at δ 6.91 and 6.77, which in conjuction with two O-methyl groups at δ 3.90 and 3.71 indicated similarity to that of (+)-11â-hydroxyerysotrine,3,14 except for the exchange of an O-methyl for a hydroxyl group in 1. Additionally, the spectrum of 1 showed signals for one trisubstituted double bond at δ 5.66 br s and for one disubstituted double bond at δ 6.96 dd and 5.96 dd, evidencing the erythrinian skeleton for 1 (Table 1). Two oxymethine protons, H-3 at δ 4.37 (m) and H-11 at δ 4.74 (dd; J ) 3.60, 4.64 Hz), were identified by HMQC spectrum, and using these protons as a starting point, the COSY spectrum permitted the assignment of the H-4 and H-10 methylenes, respectively. The relative configuration of C-11 was determined by the coupling constant of H-11 (δ 4.74 dd; 3.60, 4.64), which is in good agreement with an R-oriented 11-OH, as was also observed for compound 3. Taking into account that most 1H NMR data published for several 11-hydroxyerythrinian derivatives were recorded at 360 MHz, 100 MHz, or under, the relative configuration of the stereogenic center at C-11 was analyzed by NMR experiments and also by molecular modeling studies. The 1H NMR data recorded in pyridine-d6 clearly * Corresponding authors. Phone: 55 16 3301-6983. Fax: 55 16 3301- 6980.

The 13C NMR (Table 1) data also were comparable with those of the alkaloid 3, which possesses C-11 with the same configuration. When we analyzed the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 3, the signal due to C-11 in both was observed at higher fields, ∆δ ≈10 ppm, when comparable to the same carbon of (+)-11â-hydroxyerysotrine (also named (+)-erythrartine), which is a C-11 epimer.3,14 The total assignment of 1 was done by examination of the COSY, HMQC, NOESY, and HMBC (Figure 1) data of this compound. To confirm the relative configuration of C-3 and C-11 and to establish the conformation of 1, the structure of (+)-R-hydroxyerysotrine (3) was used as a model for a conformational analyses approach with the introduction of dihedral angle constraints obtained from the coupling constants between H11-H10 and H3-H4. On the basis of 1H NMR data, the structure of compound 3 was build with an R-OH at C-11 (similar to compound 1) and submitted to confor- mational analysis using the semiempirical methods AM1 and PM5 in the gas phase, with CHCl3 and pyridine solvents, as previously described.15,16 The semiempirical methods were applied to com- pound 3 since it was previously identified as the 11R-epimer,14 and our studies demonstrated that 3 has an 11R-hydroxyl, similar to that of the new derivative 1. Four conformers were evaluated for this compound, obtained through inversion of ring B (two half- chairs) and of ring C (two envelopes). One of the half-chairs of ring B was not stable and changed to a twist-boat-like conformation (Figure 2C). This twist-boat, together with the conformational restraining induced by ring D, avoided the inversion of the envelope in ring C, allowing us to obtain only three minimum energy conformations for compound 3, named 3a, 3b, and 3c (Figure 2). The Haasnot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation18 estimates the 3JH,H coupling constants from the electronegativity of the substituents and from the H-C-C-H dihedral angle geometry. The obtained theoretical coupling constants for confor- mations 3a, 3b, and 3c are presented in Table 1, and their energies are shown in Table 2. The comparison between theoretical and experimental coupling constants allowed characterization of the conformation of the erythrinian alkaloids as represented by conformation 3c in Table 1 and Figure 2. As already described by us,16 this Hamiltonian presents better agreement with experimental data when compared to AM1. Compound 3 was reported as the 11R-epimer in E. lysistemon.14 However, the authors presented for epimeric compounds the same coupling constants, for the 11R- and 11â-epimers. In the previous and related studies, we did not find detailed 1H NMR information that could confirm the relative configuration of each epimer, and thus an intensive 1H NMR and molecular modeling analyses were performed in this paper. Alkaloid 2 was identified as (+)-erythravine (2).17 To investigate the anxiolytic effects of the alkaloids, behavioral tests were conducted using the ETM. As shown in Figure 3 at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg crude extract (CE) impaired inhibitory avoidance acquisition was observed, similar to that observed with diazepam (DZP, 2 mg/kg; ip), a classical anxiolytic drug. Two- way ANOVA showed a significant effect of treatment (F(5,49) ) 5.4; P < 0.0001) and trials (F(4,196) ) 27.37; P < 0.0001), but not of treatment versus trial interaction (F(20,196) ) 0.87, P ) 0.626). Post hoc comparisons revealed that both CE (100-400 mg/ kg) and DZP reduced significantly the latency to leave the enclosed arm when compared with the control group (P < 0.05, Duncan’s test). Additionally, one-way ANOVA (followed by Duncan’s test) revealed that the latency to leave the open arm was significantly lower for CE (400 mg/kg) treated animals when compared with the control group (F(5,49) ) 3.47, P ) 0.009). Figure 3B illustrates the effects of compound 1 on inhibitory avoidance and escape latencies. Two-way ANOVA showed sig- nificant effect of treatment (F(3,33) ) 8.30; P < 0.001), trials (F(4,- 132 ) 14.75; P < 0.0001), and treatment versus trials interaction Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Data for Alkaloids 1 in Pyridine-d5 and 3 in CD3Cl 1 3 theoretical JHH (Hz)a position δC δH (mult.)

Individual comparisons revealed that latencies to leave the enclosed arm were decreased with both 1 (10 mg/kg) and DZP treatments. Different from CE, one-way ANOVA did not reveal any effect of 1 or DZP on the latency to leave the open arms (F(3,33) ) 0.71; P ) 0.54). The effects of 2 in the ETM measurements are shown in Figure 3 C. Two-way ANOVA showed significant effect of treatment (F(3,55) ) 13.40, P < 0.0001), trials (F(4,220) ) 44.23; P < 0.0001), and treatment versus trials interaction (F(12,220) ) 6.33; P < 0.0001) in the inhibitory avoidance measurements. Duncan’s post hoc test revealed that animals treated with 2 (3 and 10 mg/kg) or DZP exhibited lower latencies to leave the enclosed arm of the ETM when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Neither 2 nor DZP significantly changed escape latencies (one-way ANOVA: F(3,55) ) 0.61, P < 0.60). Figure 3D shows the effects of 3 on the inhibitory avoidance and escape latencies in the ETM test. Two-way ANOVA showed effects of treatment (F(3,31) ) 7.65; P < 0.0001), trials (F(4,124) ) 18.38; P < 0.0001), and treatment versus trials interaction (F(12,- 124) ) 2.14; P < 0.001) on inhibitory avoidance acquisition. Duncan’s post hoc test revealed that the doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg of 3 significantly impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, an effect also shown with DZP (P < 0.05). One-way ANOVA showed that neither 3 nor DZP produced significant effects on latency to leave the open arm (F(3,31) ) 0.24; P ) 0.86). Additionally, one-way ANOVA revealed no treatment effects of CE, 1, 2, 3, or DZP on the number of rearing and crossings (locomotor activity) in the arena test (see Table 3). The present study demonstrated that acute po treatment with CE attenuated anxiety-related responses in mice submitted to an animal model of anxiety, i.e., the ETM. These results corroborate a previous study,12 in which the aqueous alcoholic extract of E. mulungu, at a dose of 200 mg/kg, produced anxiolytic-like effects in the inhibitory avoidance in the ETM in rats. These authors also reported an antianxiety effect with a lower dose of CE (100 mg/kg) in the light-dark transition model. In that study CE increased both the number of transitions between light and dark compartments and the time spent in the illuminated area, measures considered as anxiety indices.12 Similar effects have been reported with chronic treatment with an equivalent range of doses (50-200 mg/kg) of CE on inhibitory avoidance in the ETM as well as on the number of transitions between compartments, and in the time spent in the illuminated compartment in the light-dark transition model.13 This study demonstrated that the erythrinian alkaloids isolated from E. mulungu provoked anxiolytic-like effects in the ETM. The new erythrinian alkaloid 1 and the two known alkaloids 2 and 3 impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, and these effects were similar to that produced by DZP, a classical anxiolytic drug. The underlying mechanisms involved in the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids were not in the scope of the present study and remain to be determined. However, it has been demonstrated that the dihydro-â-erythroidine, an erythrinian alka- loid, antagonizes the excitatory effects of serotonin (5-HT) at the 5-HT3 receptor.24 Thus, it is likely that the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids from E. mulungu involve antagonism at 5-HT3 receptors, as shown for dihydro-â-erythroidine.24 Although attrac- tive, this hypothesis remains to be empirically tested. It was demonstrated that the crude extract of E. Vespertilio inhibited platelet 5-HT release.23 Platelets have been used as a useful model for studying Ca2+-dependent 5-HT release,23 the main action of serotonin at 5-HT3 receptors. It is interesting to note that the highest dose (400 mg/kg) of the crude extract decreased escape latency (i.e., the latency to leave the open arm) in the ETM. Similar effects obtained with other classes of drugs have been previously interpreted as anxiolytic, instead of anxiogenic.19 It has been suggested that drugs that diminish risk-assessment behavior, such as buspirone and the serotonin releaser fenfluramine, also decrease escape latencies in the ETM.19 Curiously, the pure alkaloids did not alter escape latencies. It is likely that synergistic interactions with other compounds of the crude extract are important to provoke the anxiolytic effects observed in the escape task. Taken together, these results suggests that the new erythrinian alkaloid (+)-11R-hydroxy-erythravine (1) and the known (+)- erythravine (2) and (+)-R-hydroxyerysotrine (3) are, in part, responsible for the anxiolytic effects observed with the crude extract of E. mulungu. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were mea- sured on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz curvette (length 1 cm). UV spectra were recorded on a HPLC system Varian PRO STAR 240, UV-diodo-array 330 detector. The IR spectrum was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 or Nicolet EMACT-40 FTIR spectrophotometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and 125 for 13C nuclei, respectively. Solvent peaks were used as a reference standard. For chromatographic procedures, silica gel PF 254 and silica gel (230- Figure 2.

Molecular modeling calculations were performed using the BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2 (BioMedCAChe, 2001). Plant Material. Influorescences of E. mulungu were collected in September 2002, at Rifania, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen is deposited in the herbarium of the Departament of Vegetal Biotechnol- ogy, at the University of Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil, under the reference number HPM-0032. Extraction and Isolation. Fresh influorescences (3 kg) were macerated with EtOH/H2O (70:30) at 30-50 °C over a period of 10 days. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a humid crude extract (CE) (120 g) that was acidified with a 10% HOAc solution. This solution was extracted with CHCl3 and was then made alkaline (pH 9-10) with NH4OH and re-extracted with CHCl3 to afford a mixture of crude alkaloids (670 mg). The alkaloidal fraction was separated by flash chromatography on Si gel, eluting with CHCl3/CH3OH (100:0 f 70:30), to yield 60 fractions of 20 mL each, grouped into five (1-2 ) A; 3-5 ) B; 6-20 ) C; 21-30 ) D; 31-60 ) E). Additional preparative TLC on Si gel of the fractions B, D, and E using Et2O/acetone/EtOH/NH4OH (50: 43:4:3) afforded (+)-11-R-hydroxyerythravine (1) (48 mg), (+)- erythravine (2) (95 mg), and (+)-11-R-hydroxyerysotrine (3) (36 mg).

The system composed by rings A-D was constructed and submitted to conformational analysis. Each of the obtained conformations was further submitted to full geometry opti- mization using AM1 and PM5 semiempirical methods in both gas and solvent phases. For representation of CDCl3 and pyridine solvents the COSMO solvation model was used. The relative permittivity value for CDCl3 was adjusted to ϵ ) 4.9 and for pyridine to ϵ ) 12.5, while the effective VDW radius of the solvent molecules was adjusted to 2.81 Å for CDCl3 and to 2.9 Å for pyridine. Hessian matrix analyses were employed to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. All calculations were performed using BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2.25 In order to obtain theoretical 3JH,H coupling constants for the minimum energy conforma- tions produced in conformational analysis, we applied the Haasnot- Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation18 to the endocyclic angle geometries. Behavioral Studies. Animals. Male Swiss mice (Sa˜o Paulo State University/UNESP, SP, Brazil), weighing 25-35 g, were housed in groups of 10 per cage (41 cm × 34 cm × 16 cm) and maintained under a normal 12 h light cycle (lights on 07:00 h) in a temperature/ humidity controlled environment (23 ( 1 °C/55 ( 5%). Food and water were freely available. All mice were experimentally naive. Experimental procedures were in compliance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Local Ethical Committee (no. 35/2004). Compound Administration. CE and alkaloids were suspended in saline (NaCl 0.9%) and diazepam (DZP) in saline + 2% Tween 80. Animals were orally treated with CE (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) and with a range of doses (3-10 mg/kg) of each isolated alkaloid, or vehicle (saline), and intraperitoneally with DZP (2 mg/kg). All compounds were administered 30 min before the experimental session. Apparatus. Elevated T-Maze (ETM). The ETM was positioned 38.5 cm above the floor with three arms of equal dimensions (30 cm × 5 cm). One arm was enclosed by transparent glass walls (15 cm) and stood perpendicular to two open arms. To avoid falls, the open arms were surrounded by a Plexiglas rim 0.25 cm high. Locomotor Activity Test (LAT). To assess locomotor activity, animals were exposed to a plastic rectangular box (40 cm × 48 cm × 30 cm) with its floor divided into 30 squares (8 cm2). A standard procedure was used for both tests.19 Statistics. All results were initially submitted to Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance. Where this test yielded significance, results were log transformed and again submitted to Levene’s test, before being submitted to ANOVA. The inhibitory avoidance measures obtained in the ETM were submitted to two-way ANOVA with treatment as the independent factor and trial as the dependent factor. Where significant main effects or interactions were obtained, data were further analyzed by Duncan’s post hoc test. The escape latency in the ETM and LAT results were submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed by Duncan’s post hoc test when significant. In all cases a P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
