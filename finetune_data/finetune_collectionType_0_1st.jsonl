Harborne Abstract Three seco-iridoids 7-methoxydiderroside, 60-O-acetyldiderroside and 8-O-tigloyldiderroside, were isolated from the wood bark of Calycophyllum spruceanum together with the known iridoids loganetin, loganin and the seco-iridoids secoxyloganin, kingiside and diderroside. Their structures were elucidated by means of NMR and MS spectral data analysis. Using NOE correlations and coupling constants, the relative stereochemistry of the new derivatives was established. 7-Methoxydiderroside, 60-O-acetyldiderro- side and the known secoxyloganin and diderroside showed in vitro activity against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, with IC50 values of 59.0, 90.2, 74,2 and 84.9 mg/mL, respectively and were compared to the standard gentian violet (IC50 7.5 mg/ml). # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

(Rubiaceae), a huge endemic tree from the Amazon, has been traditionally used for the treatment of numerous human ailments including mycoses, inﬂuenza, diverse infections, cancer and skin diseases throughout ‘‘legal Amazonia,’’ which includes Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia (Correa, 1974; Rizzini, 1978; Garcia, 1975). In Peruvian Ama- zon, a decoction of the bark is used against ‘‘sarna negra’’, a subcutaneous infection caused by an arachnid (Schultes and Raﬀauf, 1990). In Brazilian Amazon, this species is known to treat stomach diseases, skin inﬂam- mation and uterus tumors (Garcia, 1975). As part of our continuing eﬀorts to study Brazilian Rubiaceae, mainly those with medicinal uses (Carbonezi et al., 1998), C. spruceanum DC was collected near Manaus, Amazon State, and submitted to a detailed chemical study. Three new seco-iridoids were obtained from the ethanolic extract of C. spruceanum wood bark: 7- methoxydiderroside (1), 60-acetyl-b-D-glucopyr- anosyldiderroside (2) and 8-O-tigloyldiderroside (3), and the known compounds loganetin (Houghton and Ming, 1985), loganin (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Garcia and Chulia, 1986), kingiside (Inouye et al., 1974), secoxyloganin (Calis and Sticher, 1984) and diderroside (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). Several natural products and synthetic compounds, e.g. sesquiterpenelactones from Asteraceae species (Chiari et al., 1991), lignans from Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae) (Lopes et al., 1998) and quinoline derivatives (Nakayama et al., 2001) have been evaluated for antitrypanosomal activity against T. cruzi, the parasite of Chagas disease, which aﬀects ca. 18 million people in Latin America and ca. 100,000 people in the United States. Besides prophy- laxis, i.e. the elimination of vector insect, speciﬁc ther- apeutic agents are needed in order to replace gentian violet, currently in use, owing to the mutagenic and 0031-9422/03/$ - see front matter # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the isolation and structure elucidation of the new seco-iridoids 1–3 along with the known compounds are presented. Additionally, the biological evaluation of all isolates against the try- pomastigote forms (Y form) of T. cruzi was undertaken. The taxonomic signiﬁcance of these seco-iridoids in C. spruceanum, is also discussed. 2. Results and discussion The ethanolic extract of dried and powdered wood bark of C. spruceanum was successively fractionated over a silica gel column and ﬁnally puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC (see Experimental), aﬀording the new seco-iridoids 1–3. seco-Iridoid 1 was isolated as an amorphous powder that gave a [M+H]+ ion at m/z 479.4539 in the high-resolution TOF-ESMS compatible with the molecular formula C20H30O13. The UV max- imum at 230 nm and IR absorptions at 3450, 1695, 1635 and 1280 cm1 suggested that 1 had a conjugated dou- ble bond and an enol ether, which is characteristic of the chromophore –OCO–C=CH–O– of iridoids. This assumption was supported by the NMR signal observed at 7.44 (1H, s) characteristic of H-3 from iridoids. Besides this signal, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed three doublets at 5.66 (1H, J=4.5 Hz), 4.54 (1H, J=7.5 Hz) and 1.26 (3H, J=6.5 Hz), one double quadruplet at 4.97 (1H, J=4.0; 6.5 Hz) and several signals compatible with a glucosyl unit. In addition, the signals at 1.92 (3H, s), 3.54 (3H, s) and 3.58 (3H, s) analyzed with 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 2), revealed the presence of an acetyl and two methoxyl groups. The 13C NMR spectroscopic spectrum exhibited twenty signals (4CH3, 2CH2, 10CH, and 4C) whose chemical shift values and multiplicities obtained from the DEPT-135 experiment strongly support the seco- iridoid skeleton for 1, especially the signals of C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9 and C-10 at 28.6, 34.7, 172.0, 68.6 and 42.2 respectively. The structure of 1 was conﬁrmed by 2D-NMR spectral analysis including 1H–1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments. In the HMBC experiment, long-range correlations were observed between the following protons and carbons (H-1 and C- 3, 5, 8, 10; H-3 and C-5, 11; H-5 and C-3, 7, 1; H-8 and C-1, 5, 10, carbonyl of acetate) as shown in Fig. 1. The relative conﬁguration of the stereogenic centers C-1, C- 5, C- 8 and C-9 was established by analyzing coupling constant values, NOESY experiments and comparison with literature data (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). The above evidence indicated 1 as the new derivative 7- methoxydiderroside (1).

Zuleta et al. / Phytochemistry 64 (2003) 549–553 The 1H and 13C NMR spectral signals (Tables 1 and 2) for compound 2 were found to be similar to those observed for 1, except for the lack of one methoxyl group and one additional acetyl group. The change from one methoxyl to one acetyl group was also observed by HRTOF-ESMS, which showed a molecular ion peak at m/z [M+H]+ 507.4725. In fact, when the 13C NMR spectral data of compound 2 were compared with those of diderroside, the only diﬀerence observed was the presence of one addi- tional acetyl group inferred by the chemical shift values at 20.6 (correlating with the singlet at 2.00, in the HMQC spectrum), and 170.3. It was also observed that the sig- nals attributed to the hydroxymethylene carbon and hydrogens in the glucosyl unit are deshielded [ 63.4; 4.26 (dd, J=3.2, 12.0 Hz) and 4.06 (dd, J=6.5, 12.0 Hz)], when compared with the values observed in a typical glucose moiety present in iridoids (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Boros and Stermitz, 1990; Boros and Stermitz, 1991). From the HMBC spectrum of 2 (Fig. 1), the diagnostic long-range correlations were observed, including those from H-8 to the carbonyl at 169.3; from H-10 to C-8 and C-9; and from H-6 to the car- bonyl at 173.0. In addition, the correlation of H-60 to C-40 and C-50 as well as to the carbonyl at 170.3, established the position of the acetyl group at C-60. The cross peak observed for the methyl at 2.00 to the car- bonyl at 170.3, was deﬁnitive to indicate that this ace- tyl was linked to hydroxymethylene C-60 of the glucosyl moiety and establish the structure of 2 as being 60-ace- tyl-b-d-glucopyranosyldiderroside. Compound 3 was obtained as a brown amorphous solid. The molecular formula, C22H32O13 was estab- lished by HRTOF-ESMS (m/z 527.4797 [M+Na]+). This compound also presented a sulphuric vanillin col- oration identical to those of 1 and 2 suggesting that it was an iridoid. Its UV spectrum (lMeOH max 230, 297 nm), as well as its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data indicated that Fig. 1. Some selected HMBC correlations for seco-iridoids 1–3.

The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed one signal for hydrogen H-3 at 7.42 (1H, s), which suggested the presence of an iri- doid skeleton, a doublet at 4.59 (1H, J=8.0) and several signals ranging from 2.99 to 3.70 attributed to the anomeric, methine and methylene hydrogens of the glu- cosyl moiety. The signals at 5.09 (1H, dq, J=3.5, 6.5 Hz), and 1.30 (3H, d, J=6.5 Hz) were compatible with those from diderroside skeleton type for this compound, as in 1 and 2. However, additional NMR spectral sig- nals at 6.79, 1.76 and 1.74, and the signals at 137.4, 14.1 and 11.8, indicated that this compound exhibited signiﬁcant diﬀerences from the signals observed in diderrosides 1 and 2. The 1H–1H COSY spectrum from 3 showed a cross peak between the signal at 6.79 (1H, dq, J=1.5, 6.5) and the signal at 1.76 (3H, d, J=1.5). In the HMQC experiments the signals at 1.74 (3H, br s), 1.76 (3H, d, J=1.5) attributed to H-500 and H-400 respec- tively and 6.79 (1H, dq, J=1.5, 6.5), correlated with the carbons at 11.8 (C-500), 14.1 (C-400) and 137.4 (C-300), respectively. The combined analysis from these data and the presence of a sp2 carbon at 128.1 suggested the exis- tence of a tigloyl unit in this molecule, which was further determined to be linked at C-8 ( 68.6). The HMBC correlations between the signal for H-8 at 5.09 with car- bons C-100 ( 166.3), C-10 ( 18.8) and C-1 ( 94.1); H-3 at 7.42 with carbons C-11 ( 166.2), C-4 ( 109.1); methoxyl hydrogens with C-11; H-300 at 6.79 with C-400 ( 14.1), C- 200 ( 128.1) and C-100 ( 166.3) corroborated the proposed structure for 3 as 8-O-tigloyldiderroside. This is the ﬁrst report on the chemical composition of C. spruceanum, a species included in Cinchonoideae, which revealed the presence of iridoid and seco-iridoids, a che- mical proﬁle quite diﬀerent from those previously descri- bed (Bolzani et al., 1984). This sub-family is characterized by indole alkaloids, which are considered as their chemical markers (Young et al., 1996). A comparison of the chemi- cal composition of Calycophyllum with two species mor- phologically related such as Chimarrhis (accumulates indole alkaloids) and Bathysa (accumulates triterpenes and phenolics), revealed deep diﬀerences on the main isolated secondary metabolites. These species are often misplaced in their genera (Delprete, 1996), so further chemical studies on Calycophyllum and allies will be useful to establish the boundaries of each genera, and will con- tribute to the taxonomic classiﬁcation of Rubiaceae, which is considered a very complex taxon (Robbrecht, 1993). All compounds were assayed in vitro against the try- pomastigote forms (Y form) of T. cruzi. The new com- pounds 1, 2 and the known secoxyloganin and diderroside displayed activity with IC50 values of 59.0, 90.2, 74.2 and 84.9 mg/ml, respectively, when compared with the standard gentian violet (IC50 7.5 mg/ml). Although these compounds have showed weak activ- ities, to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report of the antitrypanosomal activity by seco-iridoids. 3. Experimental 3.1. General Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 C. UV spectra were recorded on Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectro- photometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on VARIAN DRX-500 spectro- meter, using TMS as internal standard. ES-MS was conducted on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRTOF-ESMS was performed using a Q-Tof (Micro- mass) (40 eV). CC was carried out on silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Sephadex LH 20 (Pharmacia), respectively. TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde- H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Prep HPLC was performed on Waters Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C-18 (250 mm 21.20 mm, Phenom- enex) columns. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated C. spruceanum plant material was col- lected in Manaus, Brazil, in July and August 1998. A voucher specimen was identiﬁed by Dr. J. A. da S. Cabral and deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazoˆ nia (INPA), Manaus (Voucher No 1998-182.249). 3.3. Bioassay screening In vitro assay using trypomastigote forms (Y strain) from T. cruzi was performed according to the protocol described in the literature (Bastos et al., 1999). 3.4. Extraction and isolation Pulverized dried wood bark from C. spruceanum (1.7 kg) was extensively extracted using MeOH at room temp. The combined extracts were concentrated in vacuo to give a dark solid (230 g), which was partitioned between n-BuOH and H2O aﬀording an n-BuOH (64 g) and an aqueous (107 g) soluble fraction. The n-BuOH fraction was suspended in aqueous MeOH 80% and suc- cessively partitioned with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction (20.8 g) was subjected to XAD-2 chro- matograph using H2O with increasing proportions of MeOH (20–100%). Fractions I and II, obtained from this procedure, were further submitted to CC using Sephadex LH 20 as stationary phase and MeOH as isocratic mobile phase, yielding 21 fractions (F1–F21). 552 L.M.C. Zuleta et al. / Phytochemistry 64 (2003) 549–553 F-5 was further puriﬁed by means of HPLC coupled to a prep reversed phase column using MeOH/H2O/HOAC (23:76.6:0.5) as mobile phase, UV detection set at 280 nm and a ﬂow rate of 10 mL.min1, gave pure loganin (11.6 mg), diderroside (5.3 mg) and the new derivative 3 (11.6 mg). F-11 was puriﬁed with a similar chromatographic procedure, only varying the mobile phase MeOH/H2O (27.5:72.5), giving diderroside (12.3 mg). Fraction F-18 was also subjected to HPLC puriﬁcation using MeOH/ H2O/HOAc (27:72.5:0.5) as mobile phase, ﬂow rate set at 8 mL.min1 to aﬀord secoxiloganin (5.7 mg), loganetin (2.0 mg), diderroside (2.1 mg) and the new compounds 1 (11 mg), 2 (13.6 mg) and 3 (1.2 mg). 3.4.1.

The fungus led to the formation of a different product through an unusual epoxidation reaction between C4 and C5, formation of a C3,C10 ether bridge, and a methoxylation of the C1 of tagitinin C. The chemical structure of the product, namely 1b-methoxy-3a-hydroxy- 3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobutyroyloxygermacr-11(13)-en- 6a,12-olide, is the same as that of a derivative that was recently isolated from the ﬂowers of a Brazilian population of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia), which is the source of the substrate tagitinin C. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the substrate and the biotransformed product were evaluated in HL-60 cells using an MTT assay, and both compounds were found to be cytotoxic. We show that soil fungi may be useful in the biotransformation of ses- quiterpene lactones, thereby leading to unusual changes in their chemical structures that may preserve or alter their biological activities, and may also mimic plant biosynthetic pathways for production of secondary metabolites.

They are considered chemical markers within the family and have ecological as well as economic value [10, 37]. Moreover, STLs exhibit an array of interesting biological activities such as antimicrobial [5], cytostatic [25], and antifeedant activities [30]. They are the main active con- stituents of many medicinal plants of Asteraceae world- wide [32]. Tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) is an important STL occurring in the glandular trichomes of the leaves and inﬂorescences of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia Hemsl. A. Gray, Asteraceae) [2]. It shows cytotoxic [19], anti-inﬂammatory [33], and antifeedant activities [2], and thus is a promising compound for further research into its mechanisms of action in different targets. T. diversifolia, the source of 1, is used in folk medicine in many countries [8, 14] and has B. A. Rocha M. T. Pupo S. Said F. B.

How- ever, there remains concern regarding the ingestion of STLs because of their toxicity [35]. An interesting approach is to obtain STL derivatives that may have lower toxic effects or improved pharmacological activities, or both. Obtaining STL analogues, however, based on classic synthetic methods is not always a straightforward proce- dure, so the biotransformation of biologically active STLs is an attractive alternative providing new derivatives whose effects should be investigated [20]. The biotransformation of organic compounds by microorganisms is considered an economically and eco- logically viable technology. In addition, it is a useful tool for the structural modiﬁcation of bioactive natural products and the study of natural product metabolism [15, 16]. Moreover, some microorganisms can transform drugs in a similar way to mammals, and the utilization of microbial systems as models which mimic the metabolism of drugs in humans has received considerable attention [7, 16]. Fungal biotransformations of naturally occurring STLs have been carried out to obtain modiﬁcations that enhance activity and/or decrease toxicity [21, 24], develop structure– activity relationships [1, 4], and establish in vitro models to predict mammalian metabolites [3, 39]. A considerable number of biotransformations of STLs have been described using fungi [29]. Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16888), for example, transformed costunolide into four main products, 1b-hydroxyarbusculin, colartin, 11,13-dihydrosantamarine, and 11,13-dihydroreynosin [20]. In the same study, A. och- raceous (CECT 2069) transformed deoxyvulgarin into two products, vulgarin and dihydrodouglanin [20]. The microbial transformation of sclareolide by A. niger (ATCC 10549) yielded four oxidized metabolites identiﬁed as 1b-hydrox- ysclareolide, 3b-hydroxysclareolide, 1a,3b-dihydroxyscla- reolide, and 1b,3b-dihydroxysclareolide [31]. The STL artemisitene was metabolized by A. niger (NRRL 599) to yield 11-epi-artemisinin, 9b-hydroxydeoxy-11-epi-arte- misinin, and 9b-hydroxy-11-epi-artemisinin [27]. Microbial transformation of the germacranolide parthenolide using A. niger (NRRL 599) and A. ochraceous (NRRL 2295) yiel- ded 11bH-dihydroparthenolide [11]. A. terreus (IFO6123) transformed dehydrocostuslactone into two derivatives, 11a,13-dihydrodehydrocostuslactone and 16-(1-methyl-1- propenyl)eremantholide [13]. Cultures of two strains of A. niger (AS 3.1858 and VKM F-1119) transformed one of the most important STLs, artemisinin,into four hydroxylated products, 3b-hydrodeoxyartemisinin, 1a-hydroxyartemisi- nin, 5b-hydroxyartemisinin, and 7b-hydroxyartemisinin [28, 39]. According to the literature, the main enzymatic reactions of STLs that are able to be catalyzed by Aspergillus Fig. 1 Proposal of biotransformation of 1 into 2 by A. terreus MT 5.3 (adapted from Spring et al. [38]) 1720 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 species are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation. Thus, with the aims of obtaining new, potentially bio- active compounds, and giving insights into the new meta- bolic reactions of STLs, we carried out the biotransformation of tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) by the fungus Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3. Materials and methods Isolation of tagitinin C (1) Leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (400 g) were collected by B. A. Rocha, in May 2007, in Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil. The material was identiﬁed by F. B. Da Costa, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the SPFR Herbarium, Depart- ment of Biology, Ribeira˜o Preto, SP, University of Sa˜o Paulo, under the number FBC #126. Air-dried entire leaves were rinsed for a few seconds with dichloromethane, for dissolution of the glandular trichomes [2], thereby yielding 5 g of a yellow crude extract after ﬁltration with common ﬁlter paper and solvent evaporation under reduced pres- sure. The dry residue was re-suspended in MeOH/H2O (7:3, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane followed by dichloromethane. After solvent evaporation, the dichloro- methane layer was fractionated over silica gel 60H (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7736) by vacuum liquid chromatography [9] using increasing amounts of ethyl acetate in n-hexane, thereby yielding nine fractions of 250 ml each. The tagi- tinin C-rich fractions (3 and 4) (1.5 g, conﬁrmed by infrared spectroscopy, TLC, and reversed-phase HPLC analysis, as well as comparison with an authentic sample [2]) were puriﬁed by centrifugal chromatography (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7749; 4 mm thickness; n-hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 6:3:1 v/v as eluent; ﬂow rate 2 ml/min; UV lamp 254 nm). For ﬁnal puriﬁcation, preparative TLC was used (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730; 1 mm thickness; n-hexane/ethyl acetate/ chloroform 5:3:2 v/v, and 2 % acetic acid as eluent). The isolated compound (1, 200 mg) was analyzed by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to check its purity before the biotransformation procedure. The 1H NMR spectral data of compounds (1 and 2) were in accordance with those reported [2]. Biotransformation procedure and analysis Screening was performed on a small scale (30 ml of fer- mentation medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) to select efﬁcient conditions for the biotransformation of 1. The trials for screening procedures were performed as previ- ously described by Krishna-Kumari et al. [17]. A. terreus MT 5.3 was cultivated in malt extract medium and incu- bated at 30 C for 7 days to obtain spores. After that, the spores were harvested using a 2 % Tween 80 aqueous solution and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. The pre-fermentative medium was inoculated with 1 9 107 spores/ml and incubated with agitation (150 rpm) at 30 C for 48 h. The resulting mycelium was harvested, rinsed with sterilized H2O, and transferred to fresh Czapek med- ium (initial pH 6.0). The culture was then incubated under the same conditions for 10 days. After 24 h, 0.1 mg/ml of 1, which had been previously dissolved in dimethyl sulf- oxide (3 mg dissolved in 300 ll), was added to the culture medium. Control ﬂasks contained culture medium with the fungus but without 1, culture medium with the fungus and dimethyl sulfoxide and without 1, culture medium with 1 and without the fungus, or only the culture medium. A time course study was carried out as follows. One Erlenmeyer ﬂask was taken every 24 h; the product was extracted with dichloromethane, and then analyzed by TLC to check the degree of transformation of compound 1. TLC was carried out on silica gel GF254 (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730) plates (0.25 mm thickness, 20 9 20 cm), and the spots were visualized after spraying the plates with vanillin/sulfuric acid (1 % H2SO4 in ethanol). Thirty milligrams of 1 was used for the preparative- scale incubation with A. terreus MT 5.3 for 120 h, at 150 rpm, and 30 C. The culture broth was ﬁltered using ﬁlter paper and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting residue (45 mg) was subjected to separation by HPLC in a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp liquid chromatograph with an SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector (Japan) using a C-18 column (Shimadzu, Japan, ODS Shim-pack 5 lm, 4.6 9 250 mm; ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min; DAD detection). The main metabolite (2, 4 mg) was puriﬁed after repe- ated injections according to the following gradient: 0.1 min 20 % MeCN, 35 min 60 % MeCN, 38 min 100 % MeCN, 43 min 100 % MeCN, 48 min 20 % MeCN, and 53 min 20 % MeCN. Compounds 1 and 2 were observed at retention times of 24 and 29 min, respectively (UV detection set at 210 nm). Comparison of the HPLC proﬁles of the controls with those bio- transformed ensured that 1 had been converted to 2 through microbial catalysis. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by HR-ESIMS, 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques, and com- parison of the spectroscopic data with an authentic sample and published data [2]. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker (Germany) DPX 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H). Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Aldrich (USA). High-resolution mass J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 1721 123 spectra were recorded on a UltrOTOFq-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Microorganism Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3 was isolated from soil in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and identiﬁed by C. M. S. Motta from ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas–Micoteca URM–Depart- amento de Micologia/CCB-UFP’’, Av. Prof. Nelson Chaves s/no., Cidade Universita´ria, 50670-420, Recife, Brazil. The fungus was maintained by periodic transfers on PDA at 8 C. The microorganism A. terreus MT 5.3 was deposited in the collection ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas Tropicais’’ (Tropical Culture Collection) of Andre´ Tosello Foundation (www. fat.org.br), under accession number CCT-7640. Cytotoxicity assay Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, as described by Mossman [23]. The MTT (Sigma, USA) solution at a ﬁnal concentration of 500 lg/ml was added to the culture medium 4 h before the end of the treatment, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide to the cell culture. For cell treatment we used compounds 1 and 2, at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 lg/ml. Non- treated culture cells were used as a negative control, and cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. Statis- tical analysis was performed by Student’s t test; and Dunnett’s test was used for multiple comparisons. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁ- cant. Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Results and discussion The transformation of 1 by A. terreus MT 5.3 yielded the unusual STL 2 as the main compound. This was identiﬁed as 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobuty- royloxygermacr-11(13)-en-6a,12-olide. The 1H NMR spectral data of 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1. Although several researchers worldwide have chemically investi- gated T. diversifolia, compound 2 was isolated only from a Brazilian population [2]. As already mentioned, it should be emphasized that the main enzymatic reactions that Aspergillus promotes in STLs are hydrogenation, hydrox- ylation, reduction, and acetylation [6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 39, 40]. Interestingly, we have uncovered an unu- sual epoxidation between C4 and C5; a methoxy group was added at C1, and a C1,C10 ether bridge was formed in the 10-membered ring of 1. Nevertheless, the exocyclic double bond at C11–C13 was preserved. Compound 2 was recently isolated from a rinse extract of the inﬂorescences of Brazilian T. diversifolia [2]. Although its chemical structure is already known, this is the ﬁrst time that 2 has been obtained as a microbial biotransformation product. An interesting observation is that the Aspergillus strain used in our work was able to catalyze chemical reactions that mimicked those which occur inside the glandular trichomes from the inﬂorescences of T. diversifolia. Glandular tric- homes of Asteraceae species are the places where the biosynthesis of STLs usually occurs, and possibly where 1 is converted to 2. Thus, this fungus can be used as an alternative means of gaining 2 from 1, therefore conﬁrming the potential of biotransformation of natural compounds by microorganisms, as well as their ability to mimic plant biosynthetic pathways [34]. Spring et al. [38] reported the isolation of a closely related analogue of 1 from Viguiera quinqueremis (Aster- aceae), and proposed its conversion to the hemiketal form, such as 1b depicted in Fig. 1. The structural differences between the previously reported analogue and 1 are the nature of the C8 side-chain ester (methylbutyrate instead of isobutyrate) and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C15. The authors also discussed a spontaneous methoxylation of the 1a analogue at C1 in the presence of MeOH, thereby leading to the formation of an analogue of 1b (Fig. 1) [38]. Thus, it could be argued in our work that 2 is a compound produced by A. terreus starting from 1b, an artifact that had Table 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1 and 2 (500 MHz, CDCl3, J in Hz) H 1 2 1 6.93 d (16.9) 3.99 dd (6.7, 10.4) 2a 6.26 d (16.9) 2.57 dd (6.7, 12.5) 2b – 1,93 dd (10.7, 12.6) 5 5.88 d (9.0) 3.33 s 6 5.41 d (9.0) 5.13 dd (4.65) 7 3.55 m 4.33 dddd 8 5.33 ddd (3.2, 6.0, 10.0) 5.53 ddd (4.2; 7.1, 11.0) 9a 2.40 dd (6.0, 13.8) 1.74 dd (11.1, 14.7) 9b 2.00 dd (10.0, 13.8) 1.66 dd (4.8, 14.7) 13a 6.36 d (1.7) 6.29 dd (2.8) 13b 5.81 d (1.8) 5.62 dd (2.3) 14 1.53 s 1.50 s 15 1.95 s 1.44 s 20 2.44 sept 2.41 sept 30 1.06 d (7.1) 1.05 d (7.0) 40 1.03 d (7.1) 1.04 d (7.0) –OMe – 3.35 s 1722 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 originated from 1 in the presence of MeOH. Nevertheless, a spontaneous interconversion where 1 was converted to 1b would never occur in methods such as ours, because MeOH was not used in any step of the experimental procedure, either for isolation, analysis, or structure elucidation of 1. Compound 2 is therefore a natural product obtained by biotransformation of 1. In addition, the crude extract from the leaves of T. diversifolia used in this work had been screened for the presence of 2 by HPLC–DAD analysis, and it was not detected even as a trace. According to Barrero et al. [6], epoxidation and hydro- genation reactions of the exocyclic double bond at C11– C13 seem to be the most common processes in the microbial transformation of STLs by ﬁlamentous fungi. In order to explain the formation of the epoxide group between C4 and C5 in the biotransformed molecule 2 as well as the methoxylation of C1, we followed the proposal of Onken and Berger [26]. The authors state that terpenoids are preferentially dissolved in the cell membranes of fungi, thereby inducing changes in properties of the membrane and causing toxicity. Fungi react against these effects and co-metabolize compounds to others that are more water soluble, thus showing that the enzyme systems involved in this process of detoxiﬁcation are comparable to those of other eukaryotic cells. In the ﬁrst step, monooxygenases of cytochrome P450 catalyze the oxyfunctionalization of the molecules [12, 22]. Then, in the second step, more water- soluble products are formed by the action of hydrolases or conjugation by glutathione S-transferases [6, 12]. Thus, the biotransformation of 1 leading to 2 might be part of a detoxiﬁcation process created by the fungus. The cytotoxicity bioassay was designed to observe whether 1 and 2 could elicit cell death at the selected concentrations. Both compounds showed cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells lines comparable to that of the positive control, which was statistically signiﬁcant when compared with the negative control (p \\ 0.05). The results indicated that 1 and 2 have cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells at the lowest tested doses. Similar results were found while using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where 1 and 2 also presented cytotoxic effects, thus indicating non- selective toxicity. It has previously been shown that 1 has cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells [19], but its activity has not yet been compared with that of the derivative 2. In the same work, compound 1b was isolated from T. diver- sifolia as a natural compound and was found to be approximately 10 times more active than 1. In our work, compound 2, a C4–C5 epoxy derivative of 1b, had a sta- tistically similar activity to 1. Kupchan et al. [18] demonstrated that the in vitro cytotoxicity of STLs against human carcinoma was dependent on the presence of the a-methylene-c-lactone moiety. Moreover, evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of further derivatives indicated which functional groups con- tributed to the activity. So-called active functional groups have therefore been proposed for several STLs. It has been veriﬁed, for example, that an extra a,b-unsaturated moiety contributed to enhancing the activity of STLs with the a-methylene-c-lactone group, whereas the compounds containing only this additional unsaturation did not present signiﬁcant activity [18]. In another study, it was conﬁrmed that among other structural and electronic factors, the a,b- unsaturated carbonyl structure elements (cyclopentenone and a-methylene-c-lactone) are correlated with cytotoxicity [36]. In our work, compound 1, containing three a,b- unsaturated moieties, had statistically similar activity to 2, with only one a,b-unsaturated moiety. This suggested therefore that its extra unsaturations were not important to the effect observed in HL-60 cells. In summary, we have observed that in the presence of compound 1, enzymes from A. terreus MT 5.3 were able to generate 2 in the same way as the enzymes located in the glandular trichomes of T. diversifolia. This fungus can thus be used as an alternative source of 2 because it mimics plant biosynthetic processes. The absence of two a,b- unsaturations in 2 did not improve or decrease its cytotoxic activity in the HL-60 cells when compared with 1. Finally, we suggest that the mammalian metabolism of 1 after oral consumption of preparations containing T. diversifolia leaves should be researched in future, because this STL may form toxic compounds when metabolized.

In the present work, we determined the cytotoxic effect of casearin L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (−)- hardwickiic acid isolated from Casearia sylvestris leaves, and investigated the underlying mechanisms involved in in vitro cell death induced by Cas X in HL-60 leukemia cells (0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M). Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that Cas X was the most active compound studied, showing greater cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 lines (IC50 of 0.4 M) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, IC50 of 1.2 M). After 24 h exposure, Cas X caused a decrease in 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorpo- ration (36.6 and 24.5% labeling at 0.7 and 1.5 M, respectively), reduction in viability, and increase in apoptotic and necrotic leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner evidenced by the trypan blue and AO/EB (acridine orange/ethidium bromide) assays. Moreover, Cas X-treated cells exhibited nuclear frag- mentation and cytoplasmic vacuolization depending on the concentration tested. These characteristics of apoptosis or secondary necrosis were conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry which revealed DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, activation of the effector caspases 3/7 and mitochondrial depolar- ization. We then found evidence that Cas X causes cell death via apoptotic pathways, corroborating the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction Cancer is a pathological consequence with multifactorial causes such as mutations in speciﬁc genes (proto-oncogenes/tumor sup- pressors) or post-translational modiﬁcations of proteins, where key events can increase cancer risk and lead to uncontrolled prolifera- tion [1]. Chemotherapy remains the most important line of defense for patients with hematological malignancies and aggressive forms of solid tumors. However, drug toxicity and efﬁcacy vary widely among these patients [2]. Many drugs normally kill cancer cells by inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, two forms of cell death with distinct morphological and biochemical features [3–5]. In this sce- nario, plant compounds have made valuable contributions to the discovery of new naturally occurring anticancer agents, especially those from tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world [6]. ∗Corresponding author.

Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae), a medicinal tree that grows practically throughout the entire Brazilian territory from Amazonas State (Tapajós River region) to Rio Grande do Sul State [7,8], is popularly known as “guac¸ atonga,” “cafezinho-do-mato,” “café-Silvestre” and “erva-de-bugre.” Its leaves are used for treat- ing traumas, for skin and oral wound healing and as a topical anesthetic and antiseptic [7,9]. In vitro and pre-clinical stud- ies have highlighted its anti-inﬂammatory [10–12], antimicrobial [13–15], antiplasmodial [16], and anti-ulcer [11,17,18] proper- ties. Phytochemical investigations of C. sylvestris leaf extracts have led to the discovery of bioactive clerodanes, the casearins and casearvestrins, which are oxygenated tricyclic diterpenes with excellent cytotoxic and antitumor potential [14,19,20–22]. Despite their well-known antiproliferative actions, there are no studies showing how these diterpenes cause cell death, although Huang et al. [23] have suggested that clerodane diterpenes isolated from Casearia membranacea induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells (human prostate tumor line). 0009-2797/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ferreira et al. / Chemico-Biological Interactions 188 (2010) 497–504 In this work, we determined the cytotoxic activity of clerodane diterpenes [casearins L (Cas L), O (Cas O) and X (Cas X) and (−)- hardwickiic acid isolated from C. sylvestris leaves and investigated the cytotoxic effects of Cas X on HL-60 leukemia cells and the under- lying mechanisms involved in its in vitro cytotoxic action. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Plant material and structure determination Leaves of C. sylvestris were collected at the Parque Estadual Car- los Botelho (São Miguel Arcanjo, São Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium ‘Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann’ (Instituto Botânico do Estado de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identiﬁed by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto Botânico do Estado de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of C. sylvestris were extracted with ethanol in a stainless steel extractor with solvent reﬂux for ca. 24 h at 40 ◦C. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) and dried in desiccators over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield a dry residue. The structure of the compounds casearins L, O, X and (−)- hardwickiic acid was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in Santos et al. [21] and Santos et al. [22]. 2.2. Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines The cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes [(Cas L, Cas O, Cas X and (−)-hardwickiic acid)] was evaluated by the MTT assay [24] against 3 human leukemia cell lines: HL-60, K-562 and CEM, all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supple- mented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin, at 37 ◦C with 5% CO2. By an indirect way, tumor cell proliferation was quantiﬁed through the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2- thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product [24]. Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 96-well plates and diterpenes (0.01–10 M) were added to wells. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium con- taining MTT 10%. Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dissolved in 150 L DMSO and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX 880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin (Dox, Sigma Aldrich) was used as a positive control (0.02–8.6 M). To avoid false proliferation data, the experiments were per- formed in triplicate and the proliferation rate was always compared to negative controls. In all replicates, similar inhibition rates and cell proliferation in negative control wells were higher than in the treated wells. 2.3. Alamar Blue assay In order to investigate the selectivity of Cas X for normal prolif- erating cells, the Alamar BlueTM assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug expo- sure. All studies were performed in accordance with Brazilian research guidelines (Law 196/96, National Council of Health). Heparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug for at least 15 days prior to sampling, aged between 18 and 30 years old) was collected, and PBMC were iso- lated by a standard method of density-gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concen- tration of 3 × 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin at 37 ◦C with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (4%) was added at the beginning of culture, according to Caval- canti et al. [25] with some modiﬁcations. PBMC were then plated in 96-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well in 100 L of medium). After 24 h, the test compound (0.01–10 M) dissolved in 1% DMSO was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for another 72 h. Dox (0.02–8.6 M) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incubation, 10 L of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma Aldrich Co) were added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter®), and the drug effect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of control absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of medium only is also measured at the higher and lower wavelengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is sub- tracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOLW. A correction factor R0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOLW, where R0 = AOLW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced is then expressed as follows: % Reduced = ALW −(AHW × R0) × 100. 2.4. Evaluation of mechanism involved in leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity The following experiments were performed in order to investi- gate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect of Cas X. The doses were chosen based on IC50 values of Cas X in HL-60 cells after 24-h exposure. Cas X dissolved in sterile DMSO was added to HL- 60 cell cultures (0.3 × 106 cells/mL) to obtain ﬁnal concentrations of 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M (IC50/2, IC50 and 2 × IC50, respectively). Dox, 0.6 M, was used as a positive control. 2.4.1. Trypan blue exclusion Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay [26]. Aliquots from each well were removed from cultures after 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber. 2.4.2. Inhibition of DNA synthesis HL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with Cas X. Before the end of drug expo- sure, 20 L of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) were added to each well and the cells incubated for another 3 h at 37 ◦C. To determine the amount of BrdU incorporated into DNA, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature [27]. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and coverslipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was performed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per slide to deter- mine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. 2.4.3. Staining with hematoxylin-eosin Untreated or Cas X-treated HL-60 cells were examined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metrimpex Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar Lab®). To evaluate morphol- ogy, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, ﬁxed with methanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E, Sigma Aldrich Co. – St. Louis, MO/USA). P.M.P. Ferreira et al. / Chemico-Biological Interactions 188 (2010) 497–504 499 2.4.4. Morphological analysis using ﬂuorescence microscopy Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining of HL-60 cells was performed to determine the cell death pattern induced by increasing concentrations of Cas X. Although AO and EB are DNA intercalating molecules, the ﬁrst is able to cross intact membranes and confers green appearance to the nucleus of viable cells. On the other hand, EB is incorporated mainly by non-viable cells or in the presence of membrane instability, staining nucleus in red [28]. So, after 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted, and each sample was mixed with 1 L of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 g/mL of AO in PBS; 100 g/mL EB in PBS) just prior to ﬂuorescence microscopy analysis and quantiﬁcation (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hun- dred cells were counted per sample and scored as follows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells [29]. 2.4.5. Flow cytometry analysis All ﬂow cytometry analyses were performed in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cell debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.4.5.1. Cell membrane integrity. Cell membrane integrity was eval- uated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 g/mL, Sigma Aldrich Co. – St. Louis, MO/USA). Brieﬂy, 100 L of treated and untreated cells were incubated with propidium iodide (50 g/mL). The cells were then incubated for 5 min. Fluorescence was mea- sured and cell morphology, granularity and membrane integrity were determined [30]. 2.4.5.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was evaluated by the incorporation of pro- pidium iodide (50 g/mL). Brieﬂy, HL-60 cells were treated and then incubated at 25 ◦C for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 g/mL propidium iodide. Fluorescence was measured and DNA fragmentation was analyzed [31]. 2.4.5.3. Measurement of mitocondrial transmembrane potential. Mitochondrial depolarization was evaluated by incorporation of rhodamine 123 (Sigma Aldrich Co. – St. Louis, MO/USA). Rhodamine 123 is a cell-permeable, cationic, ﬂuorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria without inducing cytotoxic effects. Brieﬂy, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 L of 1 g/mL rhodamine 123 for 15 min in the dark. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 L in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Fluorescence was measured and percentage mitochondrial depolarization was determined [29]. 2.4.5.4. Phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. PS externalization was demonstrated by ﬂow cytometry after PS staining with annexin V according to the method described by Vermes et al. [32]. Brieﬂy, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in 135 L of PBS with 5 L of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and 10 L of annexin V-PE (Guava Nexin Assay Kit). The cells were gently vortexed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (20–25 ◦C) in the dark. Afterward, the cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (EasyCyte from Guava Technologies). Annexin V is a phospholipid-binding protein that has a high afﬁnity for PS. 7- AAD, a cell impermeant dye, is used as an indicator of membrane structural integrity. Fluorescence of annexin V-PE was measured at 583 nm (yellow ﬂuorescence) and 7-AAD at 680 nm (red ﬂu- orescence). The percentages of early and late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells were then calculated. 2.4.5.5. Detection of caspases 3 and 7. Caspase 3/7 activity was esti- mated by ﬂow cytometry, using the Guava EasyCyte Caspase Kit, after 24 h of incubation. HL-60 cells (3 × 105 cells/mL) were incu- bated with Fluorescent Labeled Inhibitor of Caspases (FLICA) and maintained for 1 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2. After incubation, 80 L of washing buffer were added and cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 L of wash- ing buffer and centrifuged again. The cells were then resuspended in the working solution (propidium iodide 1:200 in 1× washing buffer) and analyzed immediately by ﬂow cytometry. 2.5. Statistical analysis For cytotoxicity studies, the IC50 values and their 95% conﬁdence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Graph- pad program (Intuitive Software for Science,San Diego, CA).Inorder to determine differences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman–Keuls test (p < 0.01). 3. Results 3.1. Cytotoxicity against tumor and normal cells Cytotoxicity analyses by MTT after 72 h of incubation displayed that Cas X was the most active clerodane diterpene (Table 1), showing higher cytotoxic effects against CEM and HL-60 cells with IC50 values of 0.4 M for both cell lines. Interestingly, K-562 cells were more resistant to Cas X, displaying an IC50 of 9 M. On the other hand, casearins L and O were moderately cytotoxic while (−)-hardwickiic acid was ineffective in inhibiting cell prolifera- tion. PBMC assay showed IC50 values of 1.2 (1.0–1.4) M and 1.5 (1.1–2.0) M for Cas X and Dox, respectively. All following experiments were performed with HL-60 cells to investigate the mechanism of action of Cas X. 3.2. Cell viability, DNA synthesis and morphological changes HL-60 cells treated with Cas X had signiﬁcantly reduced cell via- bility and increased number of non-viable cells (p < 0.01), showing a dose-dependent effect after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1A). Aiming to understand the antiproliferative effect of Cas X, BrdU incorporation into the DNA was measured. All experiments were performed in three concentrations (0.7, 1.5 and 3 M), but the highest one did not allow a conﬁdent cell analysis after treatment, Table 1 Cytotoxicity activity of clerodane diterpenes on human leukemia cell lines after 72 h of exposure evaluated by MTT assay.

Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of measurement (S.E.M) from three independent experiments. ap < 0.01 compared to control by ANOVA followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test. probably because the concentration of 3uM is too higher, leading to destabilization of the plasma membrane and severe cell destruc- tion, interfering in the morphological examination required by the method [33]. As seen in Fig. 1B, Cas X led to decreasing BrdU incor- poration, with 36.6 and 24.5% labeling in relation to control at 0.7 and 1.5 M, respectively (p < 0.01), while Dox (0.6 M) led to 26.5% BrdU labeling. To establish whether the growth inhibition displayed by Cas X was related to the induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/EB staining by ﬂuorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment, there was a reduction in the number of viable cells in a dose-dependent manner, while apop- totic and necrotic cells increased (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was observed at the lower doses of 0.7 and 1.5 M (82 and 88.1%, respec- tively), while at the highest dose, 3.0 M, necrosis was the main cell death pattern (77.7%). Treated and untreated cells were examined under light microscopy following H/E staining. Control cells exhibited a typ- ical non-adherent, round morphology with vacuolization (Fig. 2A), while Cas X-treated cells displayed a gradual chromatin conden- sation and fragmentation, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, cell shrinking and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C–E), especially at 1.5 M (Fig. 2E). Dox (0.6 M) induced a reduction in cell volume, along wtih nuclear disintegration and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). 3.3. Mechanism of action underlying Cas X cytotoxicity – ﬂow cytometry analysis 3.3.1. Membrane disruption Cas X induced plasma membrane disruption in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01, Fig. 3A), whereas at 1.5 M (5.8%) and 3.0 M, 24.6% of the cells showed membrane lysis when compared to untreated cells (1.4%). Doxorubicin, positive control, also caused membrane disruption (7.4%). 3.3.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation results are presented in Fig. 3B. Results were obtained by DNA size, and sub-diploid pat- tern was considered fragmented. DNA fragmentation (p < 0.01) was observed in all concentrations tested in a dose-dependent manner, with 14. 5, 61.9 and 80.5% for cells treated with Cas X at 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M, respectively, when compared to control (1.4%). 3.3.3. Mitochondrial depolarization Mitochondrial depolarization is a feature of apoptosis. HL-60 treated cells (Fig. 3C) showed mitochondrial depolarization at all concentrations tested: 23.2, 68.8 and 21.8%, for 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0 M, respectively. It is important to note that at the highest concentra- tion (3.0 M) a false mitochondrial repolarization occurred, which can be explained by severe cell destruction [33]. 3.3.4. Caspase 3/7 activation Caspase 3/7 activation was found with all concentrations tested (Fig. 3D). Early apoptotic cells were observed with 3.0 M Cas X (17.3%). Meanwhile, an increase in late apoptosis (13.3, 27.7 and 10.8%) and necrosis (6.4, 6.9 and 6.1%) was observed in cells treated with 1.5 M and 3.0 M Cas X and Dox, respectively (p < 0.01). No differences were observed at the lowest concentration of Cas X (0.7 M). 3.3.5. Phosphatidylserine externalization Phosphatidylserine (PS) detection is a hallmark of apoptosis; PS resides on the surface of the plasma membrane, where cell damage leads to its externalization [32]. Cells treated with Cas X at all concentrations displayed PS externalization (p < 0.01, Fig. 4). The number of early apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner [10.1, 18.4 and 38.4% for cells treated with Cas X at 0.7 (Fig. 4C), 1.5 (Fig. 4D) and 3.0 M (Fig. 4E), respectively]. Mean- while, late apoptosis was more frequent at 1.5 and 3.0 M (17.8 and 39.6%, respectively). 4. Discussion Drug discovery from medicinal plants has played an impor- tant role in cancer chemotherapy. Of all the available anticancer drugs between 1940 and 2002, 40% were natural products per se or natural product-derived [34,35]. Nevertheless, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, either because of undesired side effects or multi-drug resistance [2]. Therefore, it is very important to ﬁnd new compounds with antineoplastic activity with more speciﬁcity against cancer cells and thus fewer side effects. In this way, Casearia species have a wide range of biological activities [11,24,36,37] that make it a probable source of new active compounds with anticancer properties. In the present work, the cytotoxic effect of the clerodane diterpenes (−)-hardwickiic acid and casearins L, O and X isolated P.M.P.

Magniﬁcation, ×400. from C. sylvestris leaves was determined in three leukemia lines (CEM, HL-60 and K-562). Also, the cytotoxicity of Cas X was investi- gated in normal PBM proliferating cells. The underlying mechanism of action of Cas X was further evaluated using the HL-60 cell line as a model [33,38]. MTT assays showed that all compounds tested were active against at least one cell line, where Cas X was the most active against HL-60 and CEM cell lines. PBMC were also sensitive to Cas X but 3-fold less than the leukemia cells. Only (−)-hardwickiic acid showed no cytotoxicity against the leukemia cell lines. Several authors have demonstrated that clerodane diterpenes, secondary metabolites present in Casearia species, are cytotoxic to differ- ent tumor cell lines, such as colon (HCT-116), leukemia (HL-60), ovarian (A2780), prostate (PC-3), and normal ﬁbroblasts (L-929, V-79) [14,22,37,39–41]. More recently, we demonstrated the cyto- toxic capacity of the Cas X against leukemia (MOLT-4, IC50 value of 0.22 M), melanoma (MDA/MB-435, 0.35 M), nervous system (SF-295, 0. 43 M), and colon (HCT-8, 0.97 M) cancer cells [22]. Concerning chemotherapeutic potential, it is important to deter- mine if the compound shows harmful effects in normal dividing cells such as proliferating leukocytes [42]. Herein, the data insinu- ate a narrow selectivity of Cas X towards cancer cells, though we previously showed that Cas X was up to 12-fold more selective against adherent cancer lines when compared to normal ﬁbroblasts [22]. Structural comparison of known casearins revealed that the main differences in activity involve substitutions at C-2, C-6, C- 7, C-18 and C-19. Replacement of the acyl group at C-6 markedly decreases activity of the derivatives, indicating that the bulkiness at that site is important for biological activity [20]. Cytotoxic effects of casearin L, O and X seem to depend on the ring structure formed by carbons C-18 and C-19, since acid hydrolysis and opening of this ring leads to molecular instability and loss of bioactivity [37] as seen with (−)-hardwickiic acid, which does not inhibit cell pro- liferation (Fig. 5). Moreover, (−)-hardwickiic acid was one of the ﬁrst diterpenes reported in C. sylvestris without the typical highly oxygenated backbone [21]. Many of the clerodanes that are highly oxygenated exhibit effective insect antifeedant, antibacterial, cyto- toxic and antifungal properties [14,41,43]. The antiproliferative effects of Cas X in leukemia cells were con- ﬁrmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, BrdU incorporation and ﬂow cytometry. Furthermore, morphological analysis using HE and AO/BE staining after 24 h of incubation revealed that treated cells displayed typical apoptotic and necrotic features, including signs 502 P.M.P.

In fact, Cas X-treated cells displayed apoptotic features concentrations as low as 0.7 M with an increase in necrotic cells at 3.0 M, probably as a result of a later apoptosis stage. Generally, apoptotic cells simultaneously show membrane integrity and high rates of DNA fragmentation [5].

Structure of casearins L (1), O (2) and X (3) and (−)-hardwickiic acid (4) isolated from leaves of Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae). used to measure plasma membrane integrity and to discriminate between primary and secondary necrosis. Also, a critical stage of apoptosis involves the acquisition of surface changes by dying cells, which trigger their speciﬁc recognition and removal by phagocytes, where the latter could eventually prevent potential tissue injury resulting from cell lysis in situ [44]. This cell engulfment is signaled by externalization of PS, a phospholipid predominantly observed on the inner surface facing the cytosol [32]. If apoptosis is acti- vated, PS on the external leaﬂet of the lipid bilayer can be detected using annexin V, a 35-kDa Ca2+-binding protein, with high afﬁn- ity for PS. The lower dose effects observed after Cas X treatment were membrane integrity, mitochondrial depolarization, DNA frag- mentation and PS externalization, all features of apoptosis. As a nuclear feature of apoptosis, the internucleosomal fragmentation of double-stranded DNA is attributed to caspases, cysteine aspartate- speciﬁc proteases synthesized as zymogens that cleave different proteins, such as caspase-3, the major effector caspase that pre- dominantly disintegrates laminin and nuclear mitotic apparatus proteins [45]. With increasing concentration of Cas X, necrosis fea- tures such as loss of membrane integrity, loss of mitochondrial depolarization, and caspase 3/7 highly activated were observed after Cas X treatment. These data conﬁrm those obtained with mor- phological approaches (trypan blue exclusion and AO/EB and H&E staining) in which dose-dependent effects were observed, sugges- tive of secondary necrosis or late apoptosis. Secondary necrosis occurs when apoptotic cells cannot maintain ATP production or control oxidative stress [46]. Dose-dependent regulation of cellular processes is one of the most important characteristics of signaling molecules naturally occurring in cells. Therefore, depending on the concentration used, many different processes may be inﬂuenced and/or altered [47]. The data pre- sented here are at odds with a previous work by Carvalho et al. [13] who demonstrated that casearins G, S and T displayed DNA damage via acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants. Our ﬁndings are also in agreement with those of Huang et al. [23] who discovered that caseamembrins A-F, clerodane diterpenes isolated from C. membranacea leaves, are able to activate caspase-8 and -9 in PC-3 cells. In conclusion, the data presented in this work demonstrate that casearins L, O and X have a strong cytotoxic effect on leukemia cell lines, while (−)-hardwickiic acid does not, which is probably related to the highly oxygenated backbone present in the casearins and absent in (−)-hardwickiic acid. Also, we provide strong evidence that Cas X exerts its cytotoxic effect through induction of apop- tosis, which emphasizes the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties and as interesting lead molecules for the design of new anticancer drugs.

The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artiﬁcial diet at 1 mg g−1 and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superﬁcial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g−1. Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic S. densiﬂora extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from V. polygama were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, ﬂavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition. 2006 Society of Chemical Industry Keywords: Tarum˜a; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; Vitex polygama; Siphoneugena densiﬂora; Spodoptera frugiperda; botanical insecticide; pest control 1 INTRODUCTION With a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efﬁcacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3 Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noc- tuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important ﬁeld crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by con- suming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4 Of the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, Vitex polygama Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5–9 This plant is commonly called ‘Maria-Preta’, ‘Tarum˜a’, ‘Congonha-cinco-folhas’ and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, Siphoneugena densiﬂora Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in S˜ao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named ‘Uvatinga’,13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack. ∗Correspondence to: Margareth BC Gallo, Departamento de Qu´ımica, Universidade Federal de S ˜ao Carlos (UFSCar), CP 676, 13565-905, S ˜ao Carlos-SP, Brazil E-mail: marejor@uol.com.br †This paper was given in part at the XX Brazilian Congress of Entomology, Gramado-RS-Brazil, 5-10 September 2004, Abstract EN-335, p. 341.

Pest Manag Sci 1526–498X/2006/$30.00 Natural products active against S. frugiperda Even though the selected plant species have not been ordinarily employed in pest control, their families comprise several species with injurious properties to insects reported in the literature.15–21 The present paper speciﬁcally deals with the effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from V. polygama and S. densiﬂora against fall armyworm (S. frugiperda). Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 General Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, J 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethanol) from Aldrich Chemi- cal Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck- Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei M¨unchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low- resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple- quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectropho- tometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pel- lets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Aus- tralia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 × 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70–230 or 230–400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), SephadexLH-20 (25–100 µm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7(Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled. 2.2 Plants Vitex polygama and Siphoneugena densiﬂora were collected in July 2000, in the city of Po¸cos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, Brazil, respectively. 2.3 Extraction and isolation The powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after ﬁltration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 ◦C. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 × 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting ﬁltrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1. Compounds 1 to 43 were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (1, 9, 14 to 18, 25, 26 and 43; see Fig. 1) are described below. Some of them, like compounds 15 and 16, were isolated from more than one different extract of the same plant. 2.3.1 Isolation of compounds 13 to 19 from Siphoneugena densiﬂora (SD-EMR layer) A quantity of 9 g of SD-EMR (Table 1) was subjected to CC using silica gel (38.0 × 5.0 cm) with dichloromethane + ethyl acetate (7 + 3 by volume) as eluent and gradient elution.

Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with methanol. A total of 23 fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven fractions (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase methanol, ﬂowrate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield compound 1 (ﬁrst peak, 5.5 mg) and substances 7 and 8, identiﬁed as a mixture, (second peak, 3.1 mg), after three cycles of 54 min. 2.3.5 Isolation of compounds 9 to 11 from Vitex polygama (VP-EMT layer) A quantity of 1.9 g and 900 mg of VP-EMT layer (Table 1) were submitted to column chromatogra- phy (3.0 × 46.0 cm) using SephadexLH-20 and methanol as eluent. A total of 23 fractions of 50 mL were collected. Similar fractions were combined, yield- ing seven fractions (EMT1 to EMT7). Fraction 3 (EMT3, 551.0 mg) was rechromatographed over sil- ica gel (230–400 mesh) using gradient elution from ethyl acetate + dichloromethane (9 + 1 by volume) to methanol; 60 fractions of 50 mL were obtained and combined into 17 fractions (EMT3a to EMT3r). Frac- tion 5 (EMT3e, 140.5 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative TLC on silica gel 60 F254 with double development, using dichloromethane + acetone (1 + 1 by volume) as mobile phase and UV detection, yielding com- pounds 9 (77.7 mg), 10 (11.0 mg) and 11 (14.3 mg) respectively. 2.4 Insect rearing Larvae of S. frugipereda used in the experiments were obtained from cultures at the Departamento de Entomologia, Fitopatologia e Zoologia Agr´ıcola of the Escola Superior de Agronomia Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo (ESALQ/USP), and maintained in environmental chambers at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod. The artiﬁcial diet used for the bioassay and previously described22 contained cooked ‘carioca’ bean 37.5 g, 1076 Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) DOI: 10.1002/ps Natural products active against S. frugiperda wheat germ 30.0 g, soy meal 15.0 g, casein 15.0 g, yeast extract 18.75 g, tetracycline 56.5 mg, agar 11.5 g, Vanderzant vitamin mixture for insects 4.5 mL, ascorbic acid 1.8 g, sorbic acid 0.9 g, methyl p- hydroxybenzoate 1.5 g, formaldehyde (40% v/v) 1.8 mL and distilled water 600 mL, in a total volume of 720 mL. 2.5 Toxicity bioassays by ingestion against Spodoptera frugiperda 2.5.1 Crude extracts and layers A quantity of 100 mg of crude extracts or fractions was diluted in a small volume of acetone (e.g. 2 mL) along with ascorbic acid (ingredient of the artiﬁcial diet). The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg g−1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 × 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 ◦C), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot’s formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 × 6.0 cm) containing ﬁlter paper at the bottom (4.0 × 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10–20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence. The control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls. 2.5.2 Isolated compounds Four well plates (24 × 1.5 mL wells) were ﬁlled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar ﬂow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 µL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artiﬁcial congealed diet. The ﬁnal concentration was about 0.1 mg g−1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar S. frugiperda larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbott’s formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound. 2.6 Statistical analysis Data consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA).

S. densiﬂora polar extracts (SD-ML, SD-HAL, SD- MS, SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, SD- HAR) were responsible for the highest mortalities (100%), followed by VP-HAL (60%), VP-HF (90%) and VP-HAF (100%) extracts from Vitex polygama, taking into account the treatment period (Table 2). They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid–liquid partition. Partition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD- AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2). The VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of Vitex madiensis caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in S. frugiperda.30 Ecdysteroids 9 to 12 (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract. Flavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufﬁcient amounts to be bioassayed. The ﬂavonoids quercetin (25) and quercitrin (26) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (25) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450- dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione S-transferases from S. frugiperda.35 In addition, quercitrin (26), a ﬂavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not signiﬁcantly different (P < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound 17, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity. 3.3 Developmental effects In general, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP- HL and VP-HF, which showed signiﬁcantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage. Compound 9, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statis- tically signiﬁcant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (P < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmen- tal stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result. Although the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds 14 and 43 (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins 15 and 17 were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea- Bulla et al.,38 gallic acid (13), the compound isolated from several extracts of S. densiﬂora and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound 14, signiﬁcantly reduces larval growth of S. frugiperda at 1 mg g−1. 4 CONCLUSIONS Polar extracts from S. densiﬂora and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efﬁcient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of S. frugiperda. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin 14 along with the insecticidal effects of ﬂavonoids 25 and 26 might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound 14 might be acting synergistically with 43, and in concert with daucosterol (19), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid 13 and other Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) 1079 DOI: 10.1002/ps MBC Gallo et al. compound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.

DIC leaf extracts of T. pallida yielded six compounds, the triterpenes 24-methylenecycloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1), 24-methylenecycloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2) and cycloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3), the sterols 24-methylene-3,22-dihydroxycholesterol (EST-1), 24-methylenecholesterol (EST-2) and 24-methylene-3E,4E,22-trihydroxycholesterol (EST-3), while the fruit extract yielded the limonoid gedunine (LIM). These molecules were dissolved in acetone and sprayed at 0.1% on tomato leaﬂ ets infested with newly-hatched larvae. Larval mortality at day 5 and 9 after infestation, larval and pupal developmental time and survival, pupal weight and adult malformation were evaluated. TRIT-1, EST-1 and LIM were the most effective against T. absoluta due to larval development arrestment and reduced larval survivorship. KEY WORDS: Lycopersicon esculentum, botanical insecticide, natural product, control, tomato leafminer RESUMO - A partir do extrato em diclorometano (DIC) de folhas e frutos de Trichilia pallida Swartz, objetivou-se fazer o isolamento e identiﬁ cação de substâncias com atividade inseticida sobre a traça- do-tomateiro, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick). Do extrato em DIC de folhas de T. pallida foram isolados os triterpenos 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1), 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2) e cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3), os esteróides 24-metileno-3,22-diidroxicolesterol (EST-1), 24- metilenocolesterol (EST-2) e 24-metileno-3E,4E,22-triidroxicolesterol (EST-3), além do limonóide gedunina (LIM) obtido de frutos da planta. As substâncias foram dissolvidas em acetona e pulverizadas a 0,1% em folíolos de tomateiro infestados com lagartas recém-eclodidas. Foram avaliadas a mortalidade de lagartas aos quinto e nono dias após a infestação, duração e sobrevivência das fases de larva e pupa, peso de pupas e porcentagem de adultos deformados. TRIT-1, EST-1 e LIM foram as moléculas que apresentaram maior atividade sobre T. absoluta, alongando o desenvolvimento larval e reduzindo a sobrevivência dessa fase. PALAVRAS-CHAVE: Lycopersicon esculentum, inseticida botânico, produto natural, controle, traça-do-tomateiro 710 Cunha et al. - Bioatividade de Moléculas Isoladas de Trichilia pallida Swartz (Meliaceae) sobre Tuta absoluta... (Picanço et al. 1995). Apesar disso, de modo geral, não se tem obtido a eficácia desejada devido à seleção de populações resistentes aos princípios ativos empregados (Siqueira et al. 2000, Lietti et al. 2005) e à eliminação de populações de inimigos naturais da traça (Miranda et al. 2005). Somados a esses problemas, estão os referentes a intoxicações de produtores e de consumidores pelos resíduos dos agrotóxicos utilizados, contaminação do ambiente e alto custo de produção (França & Castelo Branco 1992, Souza & Reis 1992, Guedes et al. 1994, Picanço et al. 1995). Assim, é primordial a disponibilização e adoção de medidas que contribuam de maneira a tornar eﬁ caz, viável econômica e ambientalmente, para o controle da traça T. absoluta. Uma das alternativas do manejo integrado da traça-do- tomateiro é o uso de espécies de plantas da família Meliaceae, fonte de substâncias com atividade inseticida. Inúmeras pesquisas foram desenvolvidas com o intuito de identiﬁ car possíveis efeitos inseticidas dessas plantas, principalmente Azadirachta indica A. Juss, comumente denominada nim, que apresenta, entre outros compostos, o limonóide azadiractina. Além dessa planta, outras, do gênero Trichilia, que contém aproximadamente 230 espécies, distribuídas principalmente na América Tropical, vêm sendo apontadas como promissoras por possuírem substâncias com atividade inseticida comparável à da azadiractina (Mikolajczak & Reed 1987, Xie et al. 1994, Ramírez et al. 2000, Wheeler et al. 2001). No Brasil, em trabalhos visando selecionar espécies de meliáceas com atividade sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), destacou-se Trichilia pallida Swartz, (Rodríguez & Vendramim 1996, 1997, Roel & Vendramim 1999, Roel et al. 2000a, b, Bogorni & Vendramim 2005). Aliado à bioatividade encontrada está o fato de essa espécie vegetal, além de ser nativa do Brasil, estar amplamente distribuída geograﬁ camente (Klein 1984), permitindo prever que tais plantas, partes destas, ou até mesmo substâncias isoladas das mesmas, têm potencial para emprego no controle de pragas. Diversas pesquisas já foram conduzidas para avaliar o efeito de extratos de Meliaceae sobre a traça-do-tomateiro T. absoluta (Thomazini et al. 2000, Trindade et al. 2000, Brunherotto & Vendramim 2001, Vendramim & Thomazini 2001, Gonçalves-Gervásio & Vendramim 2007) sem, no entanto, terem como objetivo isolar e avaliar a atividade inseticida de substâncias de tais plantas. Em pesquisas recentes, Cunha et al. (2005, 2006) identiﬁ caram a partir de extratos de folhas de T. pallida e Trichilia pallens C. DC., respectivamente, frações com maior potencial inseticida sobre T. absoluta. Nesse sentido, objetivou-se neste trabalho avaliar a bioatividade de substâncias isoladas de T. pallida, a partir do que foi desenvolvido por Cunha et al. (2005), sobre T. absoluta. Material e Métodos O processo de isolamento de moléculas bioativas de T. pallida e as características das moléculas isoladas, são apresentados por Rocha (2004). Os bioensaios foram realizados a 25 r 2oC, UR de 60 r 10% e fotofase de 14h. A criação de T. absoluta foi feita de acordo com método adaptado de Pratissoli (1995) em folíolos de tomateiro cv. Santa Clara cultivado em estufa. As várias etapas, que culminaram com a seleção do extrato em diclorometano de folhas de T. pallida como o de maior potencial de apresentar substâncias com atividade sobre T. absoluta, foram detalhadamente descritas por Cunha et al. (2005), diferindo no que se refere ao extrato de frutos em diclorometano. Efeito de substâncias de T. pallida sobre T. absoluta. Os bioensaios foram conduzidos seguindo delineamento inteiramente casualizado com seis repetições e nove tratamentos, testando sete substâncias a 0,1% [24- metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1); 24-metilenocicloarta- 3E-26-diol (TRIT-2); cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3); 24-metileno-3,22-diidroxicolesterol (EST-1); 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2); 24-metileno-3E,4E,22- triidroxicolesterol (EST-3) e gedunina (LIM)], acrescidas dos controles acetona e água. Dada a importância de se avaliar o efeito do limonóide gedunina sobre T. absoluta, embora o mesmo tenha sido obtido sem bio-monitoramento do extrato em diclorometano de frutos, foi incluído nos bioensaios juntamente com as demais substâncias isoladas a partir do extrato em diclorometano de folhas. Incluiu-se a acetona como controle em virtude de ter sido este o solvente utilizado para as referidas moléculas. As substâncias foram aplicadas em folíolos de tomateiro por meio de um miniatomizador de acordo com Cunha et al. (2005, 2006). A ﬁ m de manter a turgescência dos folíolos, seus pecíolos foram envolvidos com algodão hidróﬁ lo, umedecido diariamente. Em cada folíolo, sendo três por repetição, foram liberadas seis lagartas recém-eclodidas, totalizando 108 indivíduos por tratamento. Depois de infestados, os folíolos foram transferidos para placas plásticas (6 cm de diâmetro) onde permaneceram até nove dias após a infestação (DAI). Decorrido esse período, as lagartas remanescentes foram transferidas para folíolos de tomateiro não-tratados, preparados conforme descrito anteriormente, sendo avaliada diariamente a mortalidade de lagartas até a formação de pupas. As pupas eram então retiradas dos folíolos e transferidas, individualmente, para tubos de vidro (2,5 cm de diâmetro e 8,5 cm de altura) para a determinação do sexo após 24h. Foram avaliados os seguintes parâmetros: mortalidade de lagartas (%) ao quinto e nono DAI, duração (dias) e sobrevivência (%) da fase larval, peso de pupas (mg), duração (dias) e sobrevivência (%) da fase de pupa e adultos deformados (%). Análise Estatística. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância (ANOVA), sendo as médias comparadas pelo teste de Duncan (P d 0,05). Quando necessário, os dados foram transformados com base em teste (Hartley) para avaliação da homocedasticidade de variâncias. Resultados e Discussão Moléculas isoladas de T. pallida. A partir do extrato em diclorometano de folhas de T. pallida foram isoladas seis November - December 2008 Neotropical Entomology 37(6) 711 moléculas, sendo três triterpenóides (TRIT) e três esteróides (EST) (Fig. 1). A outra molécula, identiﬁ cada como sendo o limonóide (LIM) gedunina, foi obtida do extrato em diclorometano de frutos (Fig. 1). Efeito das moléculas isoladas sobre T. absoluta. As mortalidades de lagartas de T. absoluta observadas aos 5 DAI para 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1) e gedunina (LIM) (16,8 e 15,4 % respectivamente) superaram aquelas registradas para 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2), 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2), 24-metileno-3E,4E,22- triidroxicolesterol (EST-3) e cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3) (Tabela 1). O esteróide 24-metileno-3,22- diidroxicolesterol (EST-1), embora não tenha ocasionado mortalidade signiﬁ cativa, foi o único tratamento, aos 5 DAI, que não diferiu do triterpenóide TRIT-1 e do limonóide LIM. Aos 9 DAI, à semelhança do observado aos 5 DAI, apenas HO 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2) HO OH OH 24-metileno-3ȕ,4ȕ,22-triidroxicolesterol (EST-3) O OAc O O O O Gedunina (LIM) HO OH OH 24-metileno-3,22-diidroxicolesterol (EST-1) cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3) HO HO 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1) HO OH 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2) Fig. 1. Moléculas isoladas a partir do extrato de T. pallida em diclorometano. 712 Cunha et al. - Bioatividade de Moléculas Isoladas de Trichilia pallida Swartz (Meliaceae) sobre Tuta absoluta... as substâncias LIM (20,9 %) e TRIT-1 (19,6 %) diferiram dos controles acetona (7,2 %) e água (3,9 %), sendo que EST-1, além de não diferir de TRIT-1 e LIM, também ocasionou mortalidade de lagartas superior à do controle água (Tabela 1). Além disso, de 5 DAI para 9 DAI, observou-se um incremento na mortalidade de lagartas de 77,4% para EST-1, enquanto que para TRIT-1 e LIM os incrementos foram de 16,7% e 35,7%, respectivamente. Assim, pode-se inferir que o efeito tóxico causado às lagartas pelo esteróide EST-1 pode ser crônico, levando maior tempo para ocasionar a morte do inseto em relação a TRIT-1 e LIM. TRIT-1, LIM e EST-1, além de terem sido responsáveis pelos maiores valores de mortalidade de lagartas de T. absoluta aos 5 DAI e 9 DAI, também ocasionaram maior duração da fase larval (Tabela 2). A duração dessa fase para os tratamentos com LIM e EST-1 foi de 15,2 e 14,9 dias respectivamente, diferindo dos controles acetona (13,5 dias) e água (12,8 dias), sendo que para TRIT-1 (14,3 dias), houve diferença apenas em relação ao controle com água (Tabela 2). Além disso, LIM e EST-1 ocasionaram sobrevivência larval (67,3% e 65,0% respectivamente) inferior àquelas registradas nos controles acetona (85,6%) e água (92,5%), sendo que TRIT-1 também reduziu a sobrevivência (74,5%); porém, apenas em relação ao controle com água (Tabela 2). Segundo Rodríguez & Vendramim (1996), é interessante que haja prolongamento da fase larval, pois, em condições de campo, o inseto ﬁ caria por mais tempo propenso ao ataque de inimigos naturais, gerando ainda assincronia entre os adultos dessa população em relação aos indivíduos da população normal. Assim, o triterpenóide TRIT-1, o limonóide LIM e o esteróide EST-1, além de apresentarem efeito tóxico sobre lagartas de T. absoluta, caracterizado pelos maiores índices de mortalidade (Tabela 1), possivelmente também tenham exercido efeito fagodeterrente, que teria, por sua vez, prolongado a fase larval e reduzido a sobrevivência dessa fase (Tabela 2). Além desses efeitos, lagartas alimentadas em folíolos tratados com o triterpenóide TRIT-1 apresentaram alterações possivelmente relacionadas ao sistema endócrino, uma vez que algumas lagartas não conseguiram se livrar completamente da exúvia, o que ocasionou o anelamento do abdome do inseto, impedindo-o de se alimentar e de se locomover, ocorrendo então a morte por ocasião da ecdise (Fig. 2), assim como observado para S. frugiperda (Roel et al. 2000b). Os efeitos causados pelo triterpenóide TRIT-1 em T. absoluta e os citados por Roel et al. (2000b) foram igualmente observados em outras espécies de insetos e atribuídos ao tetranortriterpenóide (limonóide) azadiractina, principal substância com atividade inseticida do nim (Martinez & van Emden 2001, Mordue (Luntz) & Blackwell 1993, Mordue (Luntz) & Nisbet 2000). Pode-se, pois, inferir que 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1) tenha atuado de forma semelhante à azadiractina, reduzindo, provavelmente, a concentração de ecdisônio na hemolinfa, levando o inseto à morte pela incapacidade de se livrar da exúvia (Fig. 2). Apesar dos efeitos observados em relação à fase larval, TRIT-1, LIM e EST-1 não afetaram a duração e sobrevivência da fase pupal, bem como o peso de pupas fêmeas e machos em relação aos controles (acetona e água) (Tabela 3). Resultados semelhantes foram observados por Rodríguez & Vendramim (1996), que, ao avaliarem o efeito de extratos aquosos de diferentes estruturas vegetais de 11 espécies de Meliaceae sobre S. frugiperda, constataram que os parâmetros relacionados à fase de larva foram mais afetados que os da fase de pupa. De acordo com Tanzubil & McCaffery (1990), Tabela 1.

No entanto, estas não reduziram o consumo de alimento, o que reﬂ etiu em pupas com pesos equivalentes àquelas dos controles (Tabela 3). Acrescendo-se a isso, o peso de pupas fêmeas (Tabela 3) formadas a partir de lagartas alimentadas em folíolos tratados com TRIT-1, foi superior às do controle (água). Esse resultado, em princípio contraditório, uma vez que a referida substância causou as maiores mortalidades de lagartas aos 5 DAI e 9 DAI (Tabela 1), prolongou a fase de larva e reduziu sua sobrevivência (Tabela 2), pode ser decorrente de uma possível seleção, de maneira que apenas os indivíduos mais vigorosos (com maior peso), e portanto mais aptos a atingir a fase adulta, teriam sobrevivido (Vendramim & Scampini 1997). Outrossim, como se pode observar na Tabela 3, houve maior sobrevivência da fase de pupa para EST-1 em relação a EST-2. Esse resultado também parece contraditório, uma vez que o esteróide EST-1 ocasionou maior mortalidade de lagartas aos 9 DAI comparada aos controles (acetona e água), prolongou a fase larval e reduziu de maneira signiﬁ cativa a sobrevivência dessa fase. No entanto, de maneira similar ao observado com o peso de pupas fêmeas envolvendo TRIT-1 e o controle (água) (Tabela 3), possivelmente também possa ter ocorrido seleção dos indivíduos mais aptos, segundo Vendramim & Scampini (1997).

Para esse parâmetro, como houve grande variabilidade entre as diferentes repetições, caracterizada pelo maior desvio (EP) em relação às médias de tratamentos, o que confere baixa precisão. Ao se avaliarem os resultados, é conveniente se considerar em trabalhos futuros um maior número de indivíduos a ﬁ m de que a variabilidade observada seja minimizada. Similarmente, Bogorni & Vendramim (2005), ao avaliarem o efeito de extratos aquosos de folhas e ramos de várias espécies de Trichilia spp., observaram grande variação para o percentual de adultos de S. frugiperda deformados, sem constatar, no entanto, a ocorrência de diferenças signiﬁ cativas para esse parâmetro. Com base nos resultados encontrados, conclui-se que das substâncias isoladas a partir do extrato em diclorometano de T. pallida (a 0,1 %), o triterpeno 24- metilenocicloarta-3E-ol e o esteróide 24-metileno-3,22- diidroxicolesterol, ambos de folhas, juntamente com o limonóide gedunina de frutos, apresentam maior atividade inseticida sobre lagartas de T. absoluta que as substâncias 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol; 24-metileno-colesterol; 24-metileno-3E,4E,22-triidroxicolesterol e cicloarta-23-eno- 3E,25-diol. Além do mais, o triterpeno 24-metilenocicloarta- 3E-ol, o limonóide gedunina e o esteróide 24-metileno-3,22- diidroxicolesterol prolongam o desenvolvimento larval e reduzem a sobrevivência larval, mas não afetam a duração, a sobrevivência e o peso de pupas de T. absoluta.

(Rubiaceae) have been examined.1-5 Previous phytochemical studies of C. turbinata established the presence of indole alkaloids with weak antic- holinesterase activity2 as well as several phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties.3,5 Herein, the isolation, structural elucidation, and conformational analysis of a new C6.C3 lignan skeleton type (1) are reported. We have previously described the isolation of the two known phenolic compounds 2 and 3.4,6 Herein, their antioxidant proper- ties along with those of compound 1 are reported and compared with those of the commercially available antioxidant BHT. Evaluation of the parameters related to the antioxidant activity was accomplished by measuring the free radical scavenging ability of the compounds toward DPPH.7 The liquid-liquid partitioning of the EtOH extract of air-dried leaves of C. turbinata, followed by a sequence of size exclusion chromatography oftheEtOAc-soluble fractiononSephadex LH-20 and further puriﬁcation using C18 HPLC, eluted with a CH3CN/ H2O (18:88 v/v) isocratic elution using a Phenomenex Luna column (25.0 mm 21.20 mm 5 μm) at a ﬂow rate of 10 mL min-1 and UV detection at 280 nm, aﬀorded compound 1. Compound 1was obtained as an amorphous, pale brownpowder, [R]D 25 -204 (c 0.01, MeOH), which was analyzed for C29H28O12 by a combination of HRESIMS and 13C NMR data. The molecular formula of 1 was determined from the [M - H2O]þ peak at m/z 550.6433 (calcd for C29H26O11 550.1475). The IR spectrum with absorption bands at 3403, 1705, 1657, and 1627 cm-1 suggested the presence of phenolic and carboxylic groups. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) displayed signals for nine aromatic hydrogens, which indicates the presence of three aromatic ring systemswithdiﬀerentsubstitutionpatterns.Thesignalsatδ7.31(d, J = 2.0 Hz), 7.33 (ddbr, J = 2.0; 2.0 Hz), and 7.23 (s) corresponded to the aromatic hydrogens of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted ring. Addition- ally, the signals at δ 6.78 (d, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.69 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.61 (J = 8.0 Hz), 6.67 (dd, J = 8.0; 2.0 Hz), 6.55 (sbr), and 7.32 (d, br, J = 8.0 Hz) were attributed to six aromatic hydrogens from 1,3,4- trisubstituted rings. These 1H NMR data clearly conﬁrm the presence of three distinct aromatic moieties in 1. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed signals for 29 diﬀerent carbons: 11 quaternary (sp2), two of which are carbonyls (δ 176.5, C-9; 173.6, C-7a), one quaternary (sp3); nine sp2 methines; four sp3 methines, three of which are oxymethine; and four methylenes, one of which is a sp3 methines. The signals at δC 146.0, 146.5, 116.8, 115.7, 123.8, 146.7, 146.0, 115.2, 116.5, and 121.7 were ascribed to two 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic systems characteristic of a catechol moiety.8 The signals at δC Special Issue: Special Issue in Honor of Koji Nakanishi Received: October 16, 2010 ABSTRACT: A lignan with a new skeleton named chimarrhinin (1) was isolated from an extract of the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata, a Rubiaceae plant species. 13C NMR spectrometric techniques including 1D and 2D experiments and HRESIMS provided unequivocal structural conﬁrmation of this new C6.C3 skeleton type. The relative conﬁguration of 1 was established by 2D 1H-H analysis and J couplings, while its conformation was evaluated through molecular modeling using the RM1 semiempirical method, with the aid of coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. The antioxidant activity of the new derivative 1 and two known and previously isolated phenolic derivatives (2 and 3) was investigated. An IC50 value of 7.50 ( 0.5 μmol L-1 was obtained for the new derivative 1, while 2 and 3 showed IC50 values of 18.60 ( 0.4 and 18.50 ( 0.6 μmol, respectively. 488 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np1007476 |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 487–491 Journal of Natural Products NOTE 117.7, 151.3, 115.7, 151.3, and 117.7 evidenced the presence of one 1,3,5-substituted aromatic ring.9 The signals at δC 63.3, 70.2, 71.2, and 81.5 were assigned to a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran moiety. The signal at δC 91.7 revealed a peculiar downﬁeld shifted carbon, which, analyzed together with the signals at δC 28.5, 41.3, 43.2, and 173.6, allowed us to attribute one part of the structure of 1 as being a trisubstituted lactone moiety (Table 1). Detailed analysis of the 1H-1H COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra demonstrated that 1 bears a diﬀerent skeleton, with two C6.C3 units similar to those found in lignoids. Correlations between H-7 (2H, δ 3.06, d, J = 13.0; 17.5 Hz), H-8 (δ 4.22, dd, J = 13.0; 9.0 Hz), H-90 (2H, δ 2.70 and 2.75, J = 8.5 Hz), and H-80 (δ 3.33, m) were observed by 1H-1H COSY. The hydrogen at δ 3.06 (H-7) has HMBC correlations with the aromatic carbon at δ 125.6 (C-1) and with a quaternary carbon at δ 176.5 (C-9), as well as a correlation with a methine carbon at δ 43.2 (C-8). Correlations of the methylene hydrogen resonating at δ 3.33 (H-80) with C-10 and C-90 and correlations of H2-90 with C-80 and C-70 are also evident. The hydrogen at δ 4.66 (H-2b) correlates with C-70 and C-3b. From these observations and the analysis of all 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1), it is evident that the two caﬀeic acid units and a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system are connected to the δ-lactone moiety. These data suggest the presence of a δ-lactone moiety linked at C-10 (ring C) and at C-2b (ring B), Figure 2. The anisotropic unshielded signals of the quaternary carbon C-7 (δ 91.7) might be explained by its ligands: oxygen, the aromatic carbon C-10, and C-2b. The correlations between H-2b (δ 4.66, d, J = 8.5 Hz), H-3b (δ 3.68, dd, J = 2.5; 8.5 Hz), H2-4b (δ 3.57, ddd, J = 2.5; 6.0; 6.5 Hz and δ 3.41, dd, J = 6.5; 11.0 Hz), and H2-5b (δ 3.32, m) indicate that ring B consists of a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system, biogenetically derived from a tetrose sugar unit (Figure 2). HMBC correlations from the aromatic hydrogens at δ 7.33 (H-2a) and 7.31 (H-6a) of the third 1,3,5-trisubstituted aromatic ring (A) with C-7a (δ 176.5) showed that the third aromatic system is the 3,5-dihydroxylbenzoic ester moiety at C-3 of the tetrose ring (B) (Figure 2). These observations and the presence of two caﬀeic acid moieties, which could be biogenetically deﬁned as a neolignan, determined a skeleton formed by unusual couplings C-7-C-90 and HOC-9-C80. The spectroscopic evidence and a literature survey of lignan types (neolignans and lignans) indicated that compound 1 has a new neolignan-type skeleton. The relative conﬁguration of the sterocenters at C-2b, C-3b, C4-b, C-70, and C-8 and the conformation of 1 were determined on the basis of coupling constants and conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. For C-2b and C-3b, the coupling constants of H-2b (δ 4.66 d, J = 8.5 Hz) and H-3b (δ 3.68 dd, J = 8.5, 2.5 Hz) indicate a vicinal H-2bax-H- 3bax position, which is in good agreement with the presence of the gallate moiety in the β-position at C-3b. For C-4b, the coupling constants of H-4b (δ 3.56 ddd, J = 6.5, 6.75, 2.5 Hz) also conﬁrm an R-hydroxy group at this position. The 1H NMR data recorded in methanol-d4 clearly show all the coupling constants of H-4b with Hax and Heq-5b (Table 1) and conﬁrmed the tetrose moiety as part of this molecule. The coupling constants of H-8 (δ 4.22 dddbr, J = 9.0, 13.0 Hz) suggest the R-positioned 8-R, which is in accordance with the relative conﬁguration of C-8. The relative conﬁguration is assigned as 2R*, 3R*, 4S*, 70S*, and 8R*. To conﬁrm the relative conﬁguration of C-2b, C-3b, C-4b, and C-8 and in order to establish the conformation of 1, this structure was submitted to conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. The obtained minimum energy conformations enable estimation of 3JHH coupling constants by means of the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation,10 which considers the electronegativity of the substit- uents and the geometry of the H-C-C-H dihedral angle. A comparison between the theoretical and experimental coupling constants permitted the characterization of the conformation of chimarrhinin, represented in Figure 3, with the respective theoretical coupling constants (Table 1), considering the most stable envelope conformation of the tetrahydrofuran ring and half-chair conformation of the tetrahydro-2-pyranone ring. Con- sistent with previous conformational analyses of natural products with diverse skeletons,1,11,12 the employed semiempirical calcu- lations agreed with experimental data more satisfactorily when compared with older Hamiltonians such as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G** calculations. The radical scavenging eﬀects observed for compounds 1-3 assayed with DPPH are summarized in Table 2, the standard antioxidant BHT (IC50 62.50 ( 0.6 μmol L-1), and chlorogenic acid (IC50 20.0 ( 0.2 μmol L-1) used as reference. The results indicate that the free radical scavenging activity of these mole- cules is due to their hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the stabilization of the phenoxy radical after DPPH reduction. Stabilization is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and, in the case of the phenylpropanoids (2, 3), the R,β- unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by their IC50 values. Compound 1 gave the best results, with an IC50 value lower than that of the standard BHT, a well-known food antioxidant. This result may be related to the presence of two catechol groups in this molecule. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotation measure- ments were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz cuvette (length 1 cm). IR spectra were measured on either a Perkin- Elmer 1600 or a Nicolet EMACT-40 FTIR spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and at 125 MHz for 13C. TMS was used as internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained at high resolution on a Micromass Q-TOF spectrometer. For chromatographic procedures, Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) was employed. Preparative HPLC separations were performed on a Varian Prep LC 4000 System, and C18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns and precolumns were utilized. Figure 1. Compounds from C. turbinata. 489 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np1007476 |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 487–491 Journal of Natural Products NOTE Peaks were detected using a Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All solvents (Merck or Mallinckrodt) were analytical or HPLC grade. The theoretical study was carried out using the semiempirical RM1 method on MOPAC 7.0 software. Plant Material. Chimarrhis turbinata was collected in Reserva do Viro, Belem, PA, Brazil, in February 2000, and identified by Dr. Marina Thereza V. do A. Campos. A voucher specimen, Lopes-51, was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, S~ao Paulo. Extraction and Isolation. Dried and powdered leaves of C. turbinata (1.2 kg) were exhaustively extracted with EtOH at room temperature to afford 57.1 g of dry residue, which was dissolved in MeOH/H2O (8:2, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane. The aqueous alcoholic fraction was evaporated to roughly MeOH/H2O (6:4, v/v) and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. All fractions were screened with β-carotene and DPPH assays, aiming at selecting potential antioxidant compounds. The EtOAc layer was active in these assays, and this extract was selected for guided fractionation. The dried EtOAc extract (4.16 g) was dissolved in MeOH (5 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20. A total of 25 fractions of 25 mL each were collected and pooled according to their TLC profiles (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O, 65:30:5). Fractions A-6,7 and A-8 to A-12 exhibited antioxidant activity and were further purified by HPLC. Fractions A-8 to A-12 yielded the compounds described elsewhere.3,4 Fraction A-6,7 (0.699 g) was puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration over Sephadex LH-20 CC (88.0 cm 2.0 cm), which was eluted with MeOH, giving 36 Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Spectral Data for 1 in Methanol-d4 a gHMQC position δC δH (J in Hz) J (Hz)b theor gHMBC COSY TOCSY 1 125.6 H-7 2 116.8 6.78 d (2.0) n.d.c H-5 3 146.7 H-2 4 146.0 H-5, H-6 5 115.7 6.69 d (8.0) n.d.

The fractions B-20-30 (0. 387 g) tested positively in the β-carotene and DPPH assays, and they were further combined and subjected to preparative HPLC separation using CH3CN/H2O isocratic elution (18:88) [Phenomenex C18 Luna col- umn 25.0 mm 21.20 mm 5 μm, at 10 mL.min-1, with UV detection at 280 nm], to aﬀord 10 subfractions. From those, C-3 (97.2 mg) was separated by preparative HPLC using the same column described above [isocratic elution; H2O/MeCN/HOAc (84.5:15:0.5), UV detection at 237 nm, 12.0 mL min-1 ﬂow rate], to give compound 1 (4.3 mg). Molecular Modeling. The semiempirical calculations were car- ried out using the RM1 Hamiltonian13 within the MOPAC 7.0 program.14 The MOLDEN program was employed as a graphic interface for construction and visualization of the structure of compound 1.15 Hessian matrix analyses were used to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. Additionally, the minimum energy achieved by RM1 was further refined through ab initio calculations, using the GAMESS program16 at the HF/ 6-31G** level. In order to obtain theoretical 3JHH coupling constants for the minimum energy conformation achieved by conformational analysis, the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation15 was applied to the H-C-C-H dihedral angle geometries. Bleaching Experiments Using β-Carotene. After being de- veloped and dried, TLC plates were sprayed with 0.02% β-carotene solutions (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of the background. The remaining yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.7 Determination of the Radical Scavenging Activity. The DPPH radical was used in MeOH (100 μmol L-1). The reagent (2.0 mL) was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds previously dissolved in MeOH, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 μmol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and kept at room temperature for 30 min, in the dark. Chlorogenic acid and BHT were employed as standards. A DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in MeOH (1.0 mL) served as a control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured at 517 nm using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer, and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH-treated control group.

These drugs are, however, not consistently effective and, moreover, exhibit serious side effects including cardiac and/or renal toxicity.2) There is thus particular inter- est in the discovery of natural products that might be devel- oped to generate safer and more efﬁcient chemotherapeutic agents against T. cruzi.3) A number of biologically-active chromenes have been isolated from species of the genus Piper, including the prenylated chromene 1 from Piper gaudichaudianum4) and chromenes 2—5 (Fig. 1) from P. aduncum.5) Whilst these chromenes have been shown to exhibit anti-fungal4) and anti- tumour properties,5) no evaluation has yet been made with respect to their activity against T. cruzi. The object of the present study was to examine a range of natural chromenes and chromene derivatives in order to determine their poten- tial for further development to treat Chagas disease. METHODS AND RESULTS General All reagents were of analytical grade. For methylation reactions, an ethereal solution of diazomethane (30 ml) was prepared by dissolving 2.14 g of N-methyl-N-ni- troso-p-toluenesulphonamide (Diazald; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 10.0 ml of ethanol containing 4.0% potassium hydroxide.6) Hydrogenation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium (3.0 or 10.0%) on activated charcoal (Acros Organics, New Jer- sey, U.S.A.) as catalyst.7) The acetylated chromene was pre- pared by treatment with acetic anhydride (20.0 ml) and pyri- dine (20.0 ml) overnight.8) Benznidazole, employed as posi- tive control in the assays of trypanocidal activity, was ob- tained from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Plant Material Specimens of P. gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum were cultivated from seed under greenhouse con- ditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru) and voucher specimens (with codes Kato 0093 and 0057, respectively) were deposited at the Herbarium of the 538 Vol. 31, No. 3 Notes Natural Chromenes and Chromene Derivatives as Potential Anti-trypanosomal Agents João Marcos BATISTA Jr.,a Adriana Aparecida LOPES,a Daniela Luz AMBRÓSIO,b Luis Octávio REGASINI,a Massuo Jorge KATO,c Vanderlan da Silva BOLZANI,a Regina Maria Barretto CICARELLI,b and Maysa FURLAN*,a a Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Prof. Francisco Degni, 14801–970, Araraquara, SP, Brazil: b Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Rodovia Araraquara/Jaú Km 1, 14801–902, Araraquara, SP, Brazil and c Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo; Av.

Received September 18, 2007; accepted December 6, 2007; published online December 13, 2007 The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-trypanocidal activities of natural chromene and chromene derivatives. Five chromenes were isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum, and a further seven de- rivatives were prepared using standard reduction, methylation and acetylation procedures. These compounds were assayed in vitro against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The results showed that the most of the compounds, especially those possessing electron-donating groups as sub- stituents on the aromatic ring, showed potent trypanocidal activity. The most active compound, [(2S)-methyl-2- methyl-8-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate], was almost four times more potent than benznidazole (the positive control) and showed an IC50 of 2.82 mM. The results reveal that chromenes exhibit signiﬁcant anti-trypanocidal activities and indicate that this class of natural product should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas dis- ease.

Evaluation of Trypanocidal Activity Assays of the anti- parasitic activities of the isolates and their derivatives were conducted by screening their effects on the proliferation of epimastigotes of T. cruzi Y-strain grown in axenic culture in LIT medium. Stock solutions (containing 1.0 mg/ml) of the natural chromenes and their derivatives were prepared in di- methylsulphoxide and serially diluted (1 : 3) in liver infusion tryptose medium to yield sample solutions with concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg/ml. The number of remaining viable protozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber following incubation at 28 °C for 72 h with the test sample. All assays were con- ducted in triplicate. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined by linear regression analysis. The IC50 values for compounds 1—12 and for benznidazole (em- March 2008 539 ployed as positive control) are shown in Table 1. For the sta- tistical analysis, method of probits was employed. DISCUSSION As part of an on-going screening program for new anti- chagasic drugs, the prenylated chromene [(2S)-2-methyl-8- (3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H- chromene-6-carboxylic acid] (1), the major metabolite of the ethanolic extract of Piper gaudichaudianum,4) was evaluated with respect to its toxicity against epimastigotes of T. cruzi and exhibited a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 value of 33.8 mM. On the basis of this ﬁnding, the natural benzopyrans 2—5 (isolated from P. aduncum) were assayed for trypanoci- dal activity together with some novel chromene derivatives obtained from 1, 3, 4 and 5 by simple chemical transforma- tions. Speciﬁcally, hydrogenation7) of the isoprene units and of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring of 1 produced the derivative 6. The benzopyran ester 7 was obtained from 1 by methylation with diazomethane,6) and this ester was subse- quently reduced to 8 by catalytic hydrogenation. Similarly, derivatives 9 and 10 were obtained from chromenes 3 and 4, respectively, whilst derivative 11 was obtained by selective hydrogenation of 5. Finally the chromene 4 was acetylated to 12. Most of the isolates together with their derivatives showed signiﬁcant trypanocidal activities in comparison with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 10.3 mM). Compound 7 proved to be the most active with an IC50 value of 2.82 mM, i.e. almost four times more potent than benznidazole. All compounds that showed activity possessed electron- donating substituents. Within this group the prenylated com- pounds 1, 5, 7 and 11 were the most active, whilst the ester derivative 7 (containing two prenyl units) was an extremely powerful trypanocidal agent with a potency ca. 10-fold greater than that of the corresponding acid. This ﬁnding sug- gests that both prenyl and ester substituents are necessary for the strongest anti-parasitic activity. The lower activity exhib- ited by chromene 2 compared with 3 corroborates the impor- tance of an ester group, and indicates a direct correlation be- tween the electronic nature of the substituents and trypanoci- dal activity. Moreover, the observed reduction in activity of 12 occasioned by the introduction of an electron-withdraw- ing acetyl group at C-8 following acetylation8) of 4, substan- tiates the inﬂuence of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1). Reduction of the double bonds of the prenyl substituents (as in derivatives 6 and 8) gave rise to a signiﬁcant decrease in toxicity indicating their essential role in trypanocidal ac- tivity. Furthermore, reduction of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring (as in derivatives 9 and 10) resulted in the total loss of toxicity suggesting that a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring is essential for trypanocidal activity. These results suggest that substituents on the aromatic ring that contribute to an increase in lipophilicity are also re- quired for activity (Table 1). In conclusion, several natural chromenes from P. gau- dichaudianum and P. aduncum, along with a series of semi- synthetic derivatives, have been shown to exhibit potential trypanocidal activities against epimastigotes of T. cruzi. The results suggest that chromenes should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.

These drugs are, however, not consistently effective and, moreover, exhibit serious side effects including cardiac and/or renal toxicity.2) There is thus particular inter- est in the discovery of natural products that might be devel- oped to generate safer and more efﬁcient chemotherapeutic agents against T. cruzi.3) A number of biologically-active chromenes have been isolated from species of the genus Piper, including the prenylated chromene 1 from Piper gaudichaudianum4) and chromenes 2—5 (Fig. 1) from P. aduncum.5) Whilst these chromenes have been shown to exhibit anti-fungal4) and anti- tumour properties,5) no evaluation has yet been made with respect to their activity against T. cruzi. The object of the present study was to examine a range of natural chromenes and chromene derivatives in order to determine their poten- tial for further development to treat Chagas disease. METHODS AND RESULTS General All reagents were of analytical grade. For methylation reactions, an ethereal solution of diazomethane (30 ml) was prepared by dissolving 2.14 g of N-methyl-N-ni- troso-p-toluenesulphonamide (Diazald; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 10.0 ml of ethanol containing 4.0% potassium hydroxide.6) Hydrogenation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium (3.0 or 10.0%) on activated charcoal (Acros Organics, New Jer- sey, U.S.A.) as catalyst.7) The acetylated chromene was pre- pared by treatment with acetic anhydride (20.0 ml) and pyri- dine (20.0 ml) overnight.8) Benznidazole, employed as posi- tive control in the assays of trypanocidal activity, was ob- tained from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Plant Material Specimens of P. gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum were cultivated from seed under greenhouse con- ditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru) and voucher specimens (with codes Kato 0093 and 0057, respectively) were deposited at the Herbarium of the 538 Vol. 31, No. 3 Notes Natural Chromenes and Chromene Derivatives as Potential Anti-trypanosomal Agents João Marcos BATISTA Jr.,a Adriana Aparecida LOPES,a Daniela Luz AMBRÓSIO,b Luis Octávio REGASINI,a Massuo Jorge KATO,c Vanderlan da Silva BOLZANI,a Regina Maria Barretto CICARELLI,b and Maysa FURLAN*,a a Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Prof. Francisco Degni, 14801–970, Araraquara, SP, Brazil: b Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Rodovia Araraquara/Jaú Km 1, 14801–902, Araraquara, SP, Brazil and c Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo; Av.

Received September 18, 2007; accepted December 6, 2007; published online December 13, 2007 The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-trypanocidal activities of natural chromene and chromene derivatives. Five chromenes were isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum, and a further seven de- rivatives were prepared using standard reduction, methylation and acetylation procedures. These compounds were assayed in vitro against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The results showed that the most of the compounds, especially those possessing electron-donating groups as sub- stituents on the aromatic ring, showed potent trypanocidal activity. The most active compound, [(2S)-methyl-2- methyl-8-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate], was almost four times more potent than benznidazole (the positive control) and showed an IC50 of 2.82 mM. The results reveal that chromenes exhibit signiﬁcant anti-trypanocidal activities and indicate that this class of natural product should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas dis- ease.

Evaluation of Trypanocidal Activity Assays of the anti- parasitic activities of the isolates and their derivatives were conducted by screening their effects on the proliferation of epimastigotes of T. cruzi Y-strain grown in axenic culture in LIT medium. Stock solutions (containing 1.0 mg/ml) of the natural chromenes and their derivatives were prepared in di- methylsulphoxide and serially diluted (1 : 3) in liver infusion tryptose medium to yield sample solutions with concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg/ml. The number of remaining viable protozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber following incubation at 28 °C for 72 h with the test sample. All assays were con- ducted in triplicate. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined by linear regression analysis. The IC50 values for compounds 1—12 and for benznidazole (em- March 2008 539 ployed as positive control) are shown in Table 1. For the sta- tistical analysis, method of probits was employed. DISCUSSION As part of an on-going screening program for new anti- chagasic drugs, the prenylated chromene [(2S)-2-methyl-8- (3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H- chromene-6-carboxylic acid] (1), the major metabolite of the ethanolic extract of Piper gaudichaudianum,4) was evaluated with respect to its toxicity against epimastigotes of T. cruzi and exhibited a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 value of 33.8 mM. On the basis of this ﬁnding, the natural benzopyrans 2—5 (isolated from P. aduncum) were assayed for trypanoci- dal activity together with some novel chromene derivatives obtained from 1, 3, 4 and 5 by simple chemical transforma- tions. Speciﬁcally, hydrogenation7) of the isoprene units and of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring of 1 produced the derivative 6. The benzopyran ester 7 was obtained from 1 by methylation with diazomethane,6) and this ester was subse- quently reduced to 8 by catalytic hydrogenation. Similarly, derivatives 9 and 10 were obtained from chromenes 3 and 4, respectively, whilst derivative 11 was obtained by selective hydrogenation of 5. Finally the chromene 4 was acetylated to 12. Most of the isolates together with their derivatives showed signiﬁcant trypanocidal activities in comparison with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 10.3 mM). Compound 7 proved to be the most active with an IC50 value of 2.82 mM, i.e. almost four times more potent than benznidazole. All compounds that showed activity possessed electron- donating substituents. Within this group the prenylated com- pounds 1, 5, 7 and 11 were the most active, whilst the ester derivative 7 (containing two prenyl units) was an extremely powerful trypanocidal agent with a potency ca. 10-fold greater than that of the corresponding acid. This ﬁnding sug- gests that both prenyl and ester substituents are necessary for the strongest anti-parasitic activity. The lower activity exhib- ited by chromene 2 compared with 3 corroborates the impor- tance of an ester group, and indicates a direct correlation be- tween the electronic nature of the substituents and trypanoci- dal activity. Moreover, the observed reduction in activity of 12 occasioned by the introduction of an electron-withdraw- ing acetyl group at C-8 following acetylation8) of 4, substan- tiates the inﬂuence of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1). Reduction of the double bonds of the prenyl substituents (as in derivatives 6 and 8) gave rise to a signiﬁcant decrease in toxicity indicating their essential role in trypanocidal ac- tivity. Furthermore, reduction of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring (as in derivatives 9 and 10) resulted in the total loss of toxicity suggesting that a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring is essential for trypanocidal activity. These results suggest that substituents on the aromatic ring that contribute to an increase in lipophilicity are also re- quired for activity (Table 1). In conclusion, several natural chromenes from P. gau- dichaudianum and P. aduncum, along with a series of semi- synthetic derivatives, have been shown to exhibit potential trypanocidal activities against epimastigotes of T. cruzi. The results suggest that chromenes should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.

Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene isolated from the ethanolic leaf extract of C.sylvestris. The aim of the study was to assess the capacity of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris leaves and caseargrewiin F to protect DNA and verify if both the compounds cause some DNA damage, using the micronu- cleus (MN) test and comet assay in mice. Balb-C mice were treated with the extract [3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)] and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 14 days. On day 15, DNA damage was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of cyclophosphamide (CP) (i.p.) at 50 mg/kg b.w. after the MN test and comet assay were performed. A protective effect of ethanolic extract was observed in MN test (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg b.w.) and the comet assay (3.13 and 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F showed protective effect at 0.63, 1.3 and 2.5 mg/kg b.w. only in comet assay. We also tested the ability of compounds of C.sylvestris to induce MN and to increase the comet assay tail moment. The experimental design was similar to the DNA protection assay except that in test groups we omitted the CP challenge. We observed increased damage at 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F at 3.18 mg/kg b.w. in both the MN test and comet assay. We conclude that ethanolic extract of C. sylvestris and case- argrewiin F can protect cells against DNA damage induced by CP at low concentrations, but at high concentrations these compounds also induce DNA damage. Introduction Medicinal herbs have long been used in medical treatment and are still the sole remedy against several diseases in many parts of the world (1). Also, many natural products present in fruits, beverages and vegetables may be regarded as protective or even anti-proliferation agents for several types of human cancer (2). Some Brazilian natural products, including those that are isolated from Casearia sylvestris, are used in folk medicine, despite their potential toxicity. C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) (3) is a tree widely distributed in Brazil, from Amapa´ in the north down to Rio Grande do Sul and it is found in a variety of ecosystems from the savannah-like the Cerrado to the tropical Atlantic Rain forest and the equatorial Amazon forest. Moreover, it has also been found in Mexico and the Antilles (4). Casearia sylvestris is commonly known as ‘guacxatonga’ and used widely for its anti-inﬂammatory and anti-ulcerative activities (4–6) as well as its cytotoxic activity against malignant tumour cells (7). In addition, the bark of C.sylvestris has been used against fever and for treatment of herpes virus and diarrhoea (8). Phytochemical investigations revealed that the major compounds isolated from C.sylvestris exhibited both cytotoxic and anti-fungal activities (7). Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene, found in plants of the Casearia genus, described as a colourless and amorphous solid (9). While caseargrewiin F was not shown to be cytotoxic to human epidermoid carcinoma in the mouth, it exhibited cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and human small cell lung cancer. In the present study, caseargrewiin F was isolated from the leaves of C.sylvestris. In order to complement the studies of biological activity of compounds isolated from C.sylvestris, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the ethanolic extract of leaves of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protect cells against DNA-induced damage or induce DNA damage by theirselves, using the micronucleus (MN) test and comet assay in Balb- C mice. Materials and methods Plant material and preparation of extract Leaves of C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) were collected at the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (Sa˜o Miguel Arcanjo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herbarium ‘Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann’ (Instituto Botaˆnico do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identiﬁed by Dr Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris (20.5 kg) were extracted with ethanol (ca. 200 litre) in a stainless steel extractor with solvent re-circulation for ca. 24 h at 40C. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotaevaporator) and dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield 1.5 kg of dry residue. Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The identiﬁcation of compounds in ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was carried out in Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, by Andre Gonzaga dos Santos. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The sample was dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure, dissolved in 4.0 ml of methanol and ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a high performance liquid chroma- tography (HPLC) vial. The reference standard used in this work—caseargrewiin F and casearin U—was puriﬁed and identiﬁed in the laboratories of Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, Araraquara, Brazil; for details see Santos et al. (10). The standard solutions were prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of caseargrewiin F into a volumetric ﬂask. After diluting with methanol, the standard solutions (0.0079, 0.0159, 0.0635, 0.2540 e 0.5080 mg/ml) were ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a HPLC vial before injections. Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Varian ProStar system (comprising a model 240 pump, a 410 autosampler and a 330 photodiode array detector), with control and data handling managed by Star Chromatography software. Analysis was conducted using a Phenom- enex Gemini C-18 column (250 4.6 mm, 5 lm) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile: methanol: water (from 44:22:34 to 47:53:00, v/v/v, in 42 min) and acetonitrile: methanol (53:47, v/v, in 5 min); ﬂow rate 0.8 ml/min; detection range 210–400 nm; injection volume 20 ll. Analysis was realized in triplicate. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis A 5.0 mg of dried extract was submitted to SPE (2 1 cm) from silica gel (60– 200 lm; Merck): activated charcoal (Synth) (1:1, w/w) eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate (95:05, v/v, 5.0 ml). The sample was dried and diluted in hexane to afford 1.0 mg/ml solution. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chromatograph with ﬂame ionization detector using a DB-5 column (30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 lm). The carrier gas was He at a ﬂow rate of 1.33 ml/min, split mode with ratio of 1:20 and injection volume of 1 ll. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 250C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 60C, with an increase of 3C/min, to 240C. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis analysis was conducted using the same system and conditions interfaced to a mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an ion trap detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The compounds were identiﬁed by their retention indexes, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes (11) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7.0 library and of the literature (11). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis Dried extract was diluted in CDCl3 (50.0 mg/ml) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA 500 11.4 T instrument with CHCl3 as internal standard. Ethanolic extract emulsions The ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was dissolved in Tween 20 (20%). Balb-C male mice were treated with 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. The concentrations of the test were chosen based on the high solubility of the ethanolic extract in the Tween 20 (20%). Puriﬁcation and structure determination of caseargrewiin F Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris were extracted by steeping in ethanol. The dried extract obtained was separated by SPE on silica gel: activated charcoal and fraction SPE2 was separated further by normal-phase low-pressure column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. Fractions CC15-19 were puriﬁed by preparative reversed-phase (C18) HPLC to yield caseargrewiin F (850.0 mg). The structure of the compound was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. For details see Santos et al. (10). The chromatographic purity of the caseargrewiin F in the assays used was 98.6% (HPLC-UV detected at 235 nm). Caseargrewiin F emulsions Caseargrewiin F (Figure 1) was emulsiﬁed in 6% Tween 80 for both assays in mice. The Balb-C male mice were treated with 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg of caseargrewiin F per kg body weight (b.w.). These concentrations were based on ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris in which doses of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. were used; since caseargrewiin F represents 4% of the ethanolic extract, we selected doses that are 4% of the ethanolic extract doses. Animals Six-week-old Balb-C male mice were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (22 2C) and humidity (55 10% room humidity), in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized for 1 week, during which they had free access to a commercial diet (Purina) and water. The study was conduced with approval of Brazilian Ethics Commitee to Experimentation Animals (process CEP/FCF/CAr n 01/2006). Mutagenic chemical–Positive control Cyclophosphamide (CP, Sigma–Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, Lot. No. 036K1225, purity 99%) was used as mutagenic agent in experiments. CP was diluted in 0.9% NaCl just before use and the animals were exposed to the chemical by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg b.w. in 0.3 ml. Mutagenicity—MN test Experimental design The assays were performed using eight animals/group. Group 1 (negative control) mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection of 0.3 ml. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and was treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%), 0.6 ml by gavage, for 2 weeks and on day 15 the mice were injected i.p. with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl. Groups 4–9 were treated for 2 weeks by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with various concentrations of ethanolic extract (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) or caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.). These groups also received treatment with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl by i.p on day 15. Bone marrow from each animal was collected 24 h after the last administration (12). The bone marrow MN test was carried out as described by Schmid (13). All slides were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and coded to avoid observer bias. For each experimental point, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were scored to determine the percentages of micronucleated PCE. The ratio of PCEs to normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) (PCEs/NCEs) was determined in 200 cells. Genotoxicity—comet assay For the comet assay, the experimental design was the same as for the MN test in mice. Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized capillary vials and kept on ice until use. The alkaline version of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) was performed as described by Singh (14). Brieﬂy, 20 ll of blood was taken, homogenized with low-melting point agarose, spread on microscope slide pre-coated with normal melting point agarose and covered with a coverslip. After 5 min at 4C, the coverslip was removed from slides and they were immersed in cold lysing solution (2.4 M NaCl; 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); 10 mM Tris, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 1% Triton-X, pH 10) for 24 h. After lysis, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber, covered with electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH plus 1 mM EDTA, pH .13) and left for 20 min for the DNA to unwind. The electrophoresis was run for 20 min (25 V and 300 mA), after which the slides were submerged for 15 min in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) and ﬁxed in 96% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were prepared in duplicate with ethidium bromide and 50 cells were screened per sample in a ﬂuorescent microscope (ZEISS, Germany) equipped with an excitation ﬁlter of 515–560 nm, a barrier ﬁlter of 590 nm and a 40 objective. The level of Fig. 1. Chemical structure of caseargrewiin F. A. M. de Oliveira et al. 502 DNA damage was assessed by an image analysis system (TriTek CometScore 1.5, 2006) and the percentage of DNA in tail was obtained. Antimutagenicity—MN test Experimental design In Group 1 (negative control), mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and were treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with 0.6 ml Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%) by gavage, for 2 weeks, and on day 15 received CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.); the aim of this group is to ensure that Tween has no inﬂuence in possible DNA protective effect. Groups 4–9 were treated by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with solutions of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 2 weeks and, on day 15, CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p) was administered. Bone marrow was taken 24 h of CP after the injection (12). The MN test was performed as described previously for the mutagenicity assays. Antigenotoxicity—comet assay The experimental design for the Comet assay was the same as for antimutagenicity MN test and the comet assay for antigenotoxicity was carried out as described for the genotoxicity assay. Recently, Collins et al. (15) described that when comet assay is performed in in vivo experiments low concentrations of genotoxic agents are unlikely to induce signiﬁcant cytotoxicity, they also afﬁrm that a low comet assay DNA damage would be a better indicator that cells are alive than common cytotoxicity tests. In this context, to the comet assay we did not performed cytotoxicity test once at low concentrations, the compounds were not genotoxic and consequently did not present cytotoxicity that could inﬂuence in antigenotoxicity assay. Statistical analysis For a statistical interpretation, results were analyzed with Sigma Stat 3.5, Systat, CA. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test data for normal distribution, in all assays performed in the study. Since the results did not a show normal distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. In mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays, the Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare DNA damage with the negative control. In the MN tests, the PCE/NCE ratio was evaluated with the Kruskal–Wallis test. In antimutagenicity/antigenotoxicity assays, Mann– Whitney U test was used to compare all groups tested with the Tween 20 (20%) plus CP group, to assess the decrease in DNA damage. To test whether any groups demonstrated signiﬁcant reduction in DNA damage to basal levels, those groups were also compared with negative control by the Mann–Whitney U test. Results Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The 1H NMR spectrum from extract showed signals with absorptions in d 1.98–2.09, 2.20–2.40, 3.43, 5.07–5.45, 6.25– 6.75, similar to those described for casearins and other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C.sylvestris (10,16–18). Both casearin U and caseargrewiin F were identiﬁed in the extract. However, casearin U was not assayed in the present study. Quantitative High performance liquid chromatography- diode array detector analysis demonstrated that the content of caseargrewiin F in the extract was 40.0 mg/g. Additionally, the chromatogram (Figure 2) presented 29 peaks with UV spectrum similar to observed for casearins and caseargrewiin F (kmax 5 231–236 nm). The results of chemical analysis suggest the presence of these clerodane diterpenes in the extract. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) for ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table I. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were observed at 50 and 75 mg/kg (both P , 0.01). The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that there was no cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris Table II shows the protective effect of the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. Since Tween 20 (20%) was used to dissolve the ethanolic extract, in the vehicle control this solution was administered before the CP to ensure that it has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect of the test group. Consequently, there is no difference between Tween 20 (20%) plus CP and positive control. When the protective effect was evaluated by the MN test, an antimuta- genic effect was observed in mice treated with 6.25 (P , 0.01) and 12.5 mg/kg (P , 0.05). However, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not reduce the DNA damage to the basal level. In the comet assay, the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 3.13 (P , 0.01), 6.25 (P , 0.01), 12.5 (P , 0.05) and 25 mg/kg (P , 0.05). Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—caseargrewiin F The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table III. Clastogenicity and primary damage were observed at 3.8 mg/kg b.w. of caseargrewiin F (both P , 0.05) Fig. 2. Results from HPLC-DAD analysis.

Casearia sylvestris protects DNA damage 503 in, respectively, the MN test and comet assay. The parameter used to assess genotoxicity by comet assay was % DNA in tail. The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that caseargrewiin F was not cytotoxic to mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of caseargrewiin F The antimutagenesis/antigenotoxicity assays were performed to determine if caseargrewiin F protects DNA from inducible damage (CP, 50 mg/kg b.w.). Table IV shows the protective effect of caseargrewiin F against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. In the positive control, water was administered before CP, in order to maintain the same conditions as in the test groups (gavage intake) while determining the DNA damage induced by the CP without protection. To verify that Tween 80 has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect in the test group, we administered the emulsifying solution before the CP. The negative control was used to check basal levels of DNA damage. The caseargrewiin F did not show a statistically signiﬁcant protective effect when assessed by the MN test. However, in the comet assay, it signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 0.63 (P , 0.01), 1.3 (P , 0.01) and 2.5 (P , 0.01) mg/kg b.w. Discussion Previously, natural products have been used in popular medicine to treat several diseases without any knowledge about how harmful these compounds may be to human health. Recently, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of these natural products (19–21). In the present study, distinct assays were performed to reveal whether the ethanolic extracts of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F were mutagenic and or genotoxic. The results presented here demonstrated that the extract was genotoxic and mutagenic at highest concentrations in comet assay and MN test (50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F was both mutagenic and Table I.

M. de Oliveira et al. 504 genotoxic at the highest dose of 3.8 mg/kg b.w. A similar result was obtained in a recent study that describes mutagenic and genotoxic activity at high concentrations of another clerodane diterpene assessed by the MN test and comet assay (22). Considering that comet assay detects genomic lesions that are susceptible to DNA repair while MN test reveals more drastically lesions in chromosome level (23), it is important to realize that the two highest concentrations of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and at the high concentration case- argreiin F induced unrepairable DNA damage. A mutagenic effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F could represent a potential antitumour property, as previous works on C.sylvestris demonstrated strong antitumour activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (17) and its casearins (clerodane diterpenes) exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against V-79 tumour cells (18). Interestingly, in the comet assay, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was more efﬁcient at preventing primary DNA damage at low concentrations (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). The molecules with non-mutagenic and/or antimutagenic properties could have antioxidant properties and, sometimes, may activate DNA repair pathways (24). They may act directly on the mutagenic process, by increasing the ﬁdelity in DNA replication (desmutagens) or by stimulating DNA damage error-free repair (bio-antimutagenesis) (25). Additionally, ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not presented a dose- dependent response in both comet assay and MN test, and this result can be affected by various associated factors such as dependence of the effect of the substance on dose, the complexity of the test organism and the inﬂuence of simultaneous metabolic routes and enzymatic pathways (26). Caseargrewiin F was not antimutagenic when assessed by the MN test, but showed an antigenotoxic dose-dependent re- sponse in the comet assay over the range of 0.63–2.5 mg/kg b.w. (Table IV). In accordance with the present work, previous study has demonstrated that essential oil of C.sylvestris has clastogenicity and anticlastogenicity in HTC cell line (27). Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were identiﬁed in the essential oil (28) whereas in the present study, sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes were identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract. Among 15 sesquiter- penes identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract, 13 were previous identiﬁed in essential oil (11,28). The mutagenic and genotoxic activity as well as the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris could be related to the sesquiterpenes. Additionally, there are recent studies that describe sesquiter- penes as chemopreventive (27,29). However, we cannot exclude the potential biological effects of the clerodane diterpenes since caseargrewiin F protected DNA from primary damage. Moreover, the use of mice instead of cell lines to assess protective effect of ethanolic extract could better verify absorption and metabolism of C.sylvestris in a complex organism. Recently, natural products have been described to protect DNA from damage and cause DNA damage (30,31) as observed in the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and case- argrewiin F. Similar results were obtained in earlier studies and described these products as Janus compounds, referring to the mytological Roman god Janus, who had two faces in the same: one looking forward and the other backward (32). Comet assay also revealed that C.sylvestris exhibited chemoprotective effects, but was not able to reduce the levels of DNA damage to negative controls values. Other studies suggested similar effects. Santos and Takahashi (33) demonstrated that seleno- methionine, a selenium-derived antioxidant compound, was both genotoxic and antigenotoxic and reduced the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, but not to values as low as the negative control. Cytotoxic events could lead to overestimation of the chemoprotective effects observed here. Thus, it is also important to consider that C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F did not exhibit cytotoxic effects alone neither in combination with the CP as observed in the PCE/NCE values. Likewise, the chemoprotective effects can be considered only in the concentrations that did not exhibit genotoxic effects, a recom- mendation of the publication of Zeiger (34). Thus, our results demonstrate that the beneﬁts of using ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F as DNA protective compounds could be respectively safe at doses ,50 mg/kg b.w. and 3.8 mg/kg b.w. We conclude that the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protects DNA against damage in low concentrations, which was carefully estimated by using MN test and comet assay. Keeping in mind that the same ethanolic extract and caseargrewiin F also can cause DNA damage in high concentrations.

Introduction Fungal endophytes comprise a wide range of fungi character- ized by the ability to live for a certain period of their life-cycles internally and asymptomatically in plants (Wang et al., 2007). Such co-existence may confer adaptative advantages to the plant host, such as feeding deterrence, protection against insects and microbial pathogens (De Souza et al., 2004). Considering that chemical clues are usually involved in these biological interactions, natural products from endophytic fungi very often present a broad spectrum of biological activities (Zhang et al., 2006). Isocoumarins are metabolites of limited distribution, which occur in bacteria, fungi and lichen (Kutschera et al., 2003). These compounds have also been detected in secretions of termites and ants (Engelmeier et al., 2004). Several biological activities have been reported for this class, including cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antiallergic, algicidal, gastroprotective, protease inhibitory, anti- fungal (O¨ zcan et al., 2007; Krohn et al., 1997; Guimara˜es et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009) as well as plant growth regulators (Kuramata et al., 2007). The Brazilian cerrado trees are well known sources of bioactive secondary metabolites (Bolzani et al., 1991; Young et al., 1992; Silva et al., 2007, 2010). Among these, A. macrophylla K. Schum (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were chosen for a detailed microbiological investigation. These plants presented several endophytes, including Penicillium and Xylaria species, which were submitted to chemical and biological investigations. Herein, we report the isolation and biological activities of one new dihydroisocoumarin, (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6-dihydroxy-3- methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid (1) and two known dihydroisocoumarins, (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Fig. 1). 2. Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as yellow amorphous powder, and showed a positive reaction with ferric chloride suggesting the presence of a phenol functionality. The IR spectrum of 1 showed strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (3474 cm1) and a conjugated carbonyl group (1672 cm1). The UV spectrum of 1 displayed absorptions (lmax) (log e) at 220 (4.28) and 314 (3.34), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a dihydroisocoumarin structure (Pontius et al., 2008). Its elemental composition C11H10O6 with seven degrees of insaturation was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([MH]) at m/z 237.0381 (calcd for C11H9O6, 237.0399), consistent with its 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

Additionally, two known compounds, (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3), were isolated from Penicillium sp. associated to Alibertia macrophylla (Rubiaceae).

The 13C NMR, DEPT 908, and 1H–13C gHMQC indicated that compound 1 had one methyl, four methines, and six quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 169.5 and d 167.1, assigned toa carboxyl and toad-lactonegroups, respectively.The 1H NMR and 1H–1H gCOSY spectra of 1 showed two ortho-coupled hydrogens at d 7.04 (H-8) and d 8.10 (H-9), suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 1H–1H gCOSY spectrum indicated a spin system in 1 which included a methyl group atd 1.43 (H3C-10) coupled with an oxymethine hydrogen at d 4.72 (H-3), itselfcoupledwithamethinehydrogenatd5.47(H-4).Therefore,the aliphatic portion of 1 was unambiguously established as a H3C– CH(O–)–CH–OH chain. Long-range correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum between H-7 (d 7.04) with C-6 (d 163.9), C-5 (d 108.7), and C-8a (d 120.0), between H-4 (d 5.47) with C-4a (d 144.8), C-5, C-8a and C-3 (d 78.2), as well as between H-8 (d 8.10) with C-6, C-1 (d 167.1) and C-4a enabled us to establish unequivocally the substitution pattern of the aromatic moiety of 1. A logical deduction ofthe datacollectedwouldobviouslyleadtothe structure1.SinceH- 3 and H-4 showed a coupling constant of 1.8 Hz, these protons had an axial–equatorial relationship. Thus, the relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was established as (3R*, 4R*). This relative conﬁguration at C-3 and C-4 was very similar when compared with data of similar isochromanes (Okuno et al., 1986; Aldridge et al., 1971). A comparison of the optical rotation of 1 ([a]D 28 60.3, c 0.034, MeOH)withthe literature values reportedfor three of the four possible 4-hydroxymellein stereoisomers (Devys et al., 1980) indicated that (3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-mellein has both the signal and magnitude of optical rotation ([a]D 1.5) comparable to compound 1. Therefore, the absolute conﬁguration of 1 was assigned as (3R,4R) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Hence, the structure of compound 1 was completely elucidated, and established as (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6- dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid. In addition, two known dihydroisocoumarins were isolated from a Penicillium sp. and identiﬁed as (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Compounds 2 and 3 were identiﬁed by analysis of spectroscopic data, as well as of optical rotation data, with literature values. Both 2 and 3 exhibited a rare 7,8-dihydroxy substitution. To date, related compounds have been isolated from plant and fungi sources, including Azadirachta indica, Septoria nodorum, Cytospora eucalypticola, Nodulisporum sp. and Cephalosporium sp. (Devys et al., 1980; Siddiqui et al., 1988; Kokubun et al., 2003; Bi et al., 2006; Pontius et al., 2008). The cathecol moiety of 2 and 3 is probably formed after an additional oxidation at C-7, subsequently to the formation of the aromatic polyketide skeleton. Dihydroisocoumarins 1–3 were evaluated for their antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladospor- ioides using direct bioautography assay (Table 1) (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds 2 and 3 showed a potent effect against the yeasts, exhibiting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 mg against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 1 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity towards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 mg, respectively. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydroisocoumarins and catechol moiety at C-7 and C-8. The identiﬁcation of the compounds 1–3, potentially bioactive against the phytopathogenic fungi, indicates that they act as defense of the host species against possible infection by pathogens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for metabolites from Penicillium and Xylaria genera, few studies have been devoted to the acetylcholin- esterase inhibitory activity of this class of pentaketides. Com- pounds 2 and 3 showed a limit of detection of 10 mg in a TLC-based AChE inhibition assay which was considered as weakly potent. Dihydroisocoumarin 1 displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 3.0 mg. In conclusion, three dihydrocoumarin derivatives, one new from Xylaria sp. and two known from Penicillium sp., associated with P. aduncum and A. macrophylla leaves, respectively, have been isolated and identiﬁed and exhibited antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results herein reported suggest that dihydrocoumarins should be considered as potential lead com- pounds in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for use in the drug design for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the non-deuterated residual signal as refer- ence. Mass spectra were measured on a LC–MS Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using the ESI mode and MeOH–H2O (1:1) as eluent (cone voltage 25 V). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde- hyde–H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 8C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C18 (250 mm 21.2 mm) preparative column. Ana- lytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 HPLC system using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica [()TD$FIG] OH HO O O OH CH3 OH HO O O CH3 2 3 10 9 O O OH CH3 1 1 4 4a 7 8a HO CO2H Fig. 1. Structures of compounds 1–3.

Optical rotations were measured with PerkinElmer polarimeter with sodium lamp operating at 589 nm at 28 8C. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated A. macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were collected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Ecolo´gica Experimental de Mogi-Guac¸u, Fazenda Campininha’’, Mogi-Guac¸u, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identiﬁcations were assigned by Dr. Ineˆs Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher no. SP 370915 and Cordeiro PAO, respectively). 3.3. Isolation and identiﬁcation of the endophytes Adult and healthy leaves of P. aduncum and A. macrophylla were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. Leaves were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and in 70% aqueous EtOH for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate (50 mg/mL), 3–4 pieces on each dish. The material of the two species was incubated at 25 8C for 10 days and the endophytes Penicillium sp. and Xylaria sp. were isolated by successive inoculation in Petri dishes from Alibertia macrophyla and P. aduncum, respectively (Silva et al., 2006). The fungus Penicillium sp. was identiﬁed by Dr. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quı´micas, Biolo´ gicas e Agrı´colas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number 05070032-C. The fungus Xylaria sp. was identiﬁed by Prof. Dr. Ludwing H. Pfenning (Universidade Federal de Lavras, Departamento de Fitopatologia) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number PA-01. 3.4. Growth of Xylaria sp. and extraction The strain was inoculated in twenty Erlenmeyers (500 mL each) containing each one: 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose (PDB) in 300 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved at 121 8C for 15 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, for 28 days. The mycelia biomass accumulated in the Erlenmeyers was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was subjected to a liquid–liquid partition with EtOAc (3 2 L). The EtOAc fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g). 3.4.1. Extraction and isolation of compound 1 The crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g) was puriﬁed by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting with MeOH, to afford 08 fractions (F-1–F-8, 100 mL portions). Compound 1 (175.0 mg) was obtained from fractions F-6 to F-7 as a yellow amorphous powder. 3.5. Growth of Penicillium sp. and growth medium extraction The Penicillium sp. strain was inoculated in nine Erlenmeyers (500 mL each), containing each one: 90 g of corn meal in 75 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 8C for 40 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C in still mode during 21 days. At the end of the growth period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 250 mL). The MeOH was evaporated, to give 15 g of the MeOH extract. The MeOH extract was dissolved in MeCN and then subjected to liquid– liquid partition with hexane. The MeCN fraction was evaporated to give 6.0 g of a MeCN-deffated extract. 3.5.1. Extraction and Isolation of compounds 2 and 3 The MeCN-deffated fraction obtained (6.0 g) was fractionated using a C18 reversed-phase CC, eluted with a gradient of MeOH in H2O (5–100% MeOH), to afford 16 fractions (Fr1–Fr16). Fraction Fr- 2 (218.0 mg) was further separated using RP-HPLC [l = 254 nm, 10.0 ml/min, 8:2 H2O–MeCN (80 min)], to give compounds 2 (6.3 mg, Rt = 40.3 min) and 3 (6.1 mg, Rt = 30.0 min).

Antifungal activity Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. Compounds 1–3 were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.00 and 1.00 mg samples of pure compounds. After eluting with CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the plates were sprayed with the fungi suspension (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was used as a positive control at 1.0 mg. 3.7. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity Acetylcholinesterase (1000 U) was dissolved in 150 mL of 0.05 M Tris–hydrochloric acid buffer at pH 7.8. Bovine serum albumin (150 mg) was added to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 8C. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol) in order to clean the plates before drying at 30 8C. After elution of samples in CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the TLC plates were dried at 30 8C for complete removal of solvent. The plates were then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and carefully dried at r.t. again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was deposited ﬂat over plastic plugs in a covered plastic tank containing a small amount of H2O, in order to keep the humidity constant. The incubation of plates was performed at 37 8C for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1- naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple coloration after 1–2 min (if positive). Galantamine was employed as positive control 1.0 mg (Marston et al., 2002).

A atividade de extratos brutos de três espécies de Rapanea (Myrsinaceae) e de Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) foi avaliada in vitro contra formas tripomastigotas de Trypanosoma cruzi. Foram obtidos 33 extratos de diferentes órgãos das espécies estudadas, sendo que onze deles apresentaram atividades significantes (% de lise > 50) nos ensaios realizados. O fracionamento de um extrato ativo dos galhos de R. lancifolia (99,5%) resultou no isolamento de dois flavonoides (quercetina e taxifolina), que apresentaram baixa atividade tripanocida. De um extrato ativo dos frutos de C. fruticosa (97,7%) foram isolados os limonoides mexicanolídeos cipadesina, mexicanolídeo, febrifugina e cipadesina A, que foram moderadamente ativos sobre T. cruzi.

ABSTRACT: The activity of crude extracts of three Rapanea species (Myrsinaceae) and Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Thirty-three extracts from different organs of these species were assayed and eleven of them showed significant activity (lysis % >50). The fractionation of an active extract from branches of R. lancifolia (99.5%) led to the isolation of two flavonoids: quercetin and taxifolin, which have weak trypanocidal activity. Additionally, one active extract from fruits of C. fruticosa (97.7%) afforded mexicanolide limonoids: cipadesin, mexicanolide, febrifugin and cipadesin A, that were slightly active on T. cruzi. Moreover, other two flavonoids (flavone and 7-methoxyflavone), previously assayed against T. cruzi, were isolated from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (100%). The results presented here suggest that the plants evaluated could be a source of new active compounds against T. cruzi.

It is caused by a flagellate protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted to humans by blood-sucking triatomine insects and by blood transfusion (WHO, 1997). With the control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans), infected blood transfusion is becoming the major cause for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). The only trypanocidal substance currently used to prevent the infection by this route is gentian violet, but its use is limited due to undesirable effects on the patients (Dias, 1993). The treatment of Chagas’ disease is still a challenge, since the only current available drug (benznidazole) has strong side effects (de Castro, 1993). Thus, the search for more efficient and less toxic drugs is needed to control this disease. In the past years, the study of compounds isolated from plants has received considerable attention in the search for alternative chemotherapy of parasitic diseases (Serrano et al., 2000) and many natural compounds have been identified as trypanocides (Duschak & Couto, 2007; 2 Guimarães & Faria, 2007). Several extracts from plants of Meliaceae and Rutaceae families have been showed in vitro activity against T. cruzi (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004; de Mesquita et al., 2005). Therefore, natural products constitute a promising source of new active compounds for treatment of Chagas’ disease. In this paper, we report the results of the evaluation of in vitro trypanocidal activity of 33 crude extracts from different organs of Rapanea lancifolia, R. guianensis, R. umbelata Myrsinaceae, and Cipadessa fruticosa Meliaceae. Moreover, it is showed the trypanocidal activity of flavonoids isolated from hexane extracts from branches of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa, as well the activity of four limonoids isolated from dichloromethane extract from fruits of C. fruticosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material Plants were collected in different states of Brazil and identified by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP and Dr. José Rubens Pirani from Department of Botany, USP, SP (Table 1).

The hexane extract (12.2 g) from branches of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 1524 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give nine fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1), affording nine fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2- MeOH (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 7 (16.7 mg) and 8 (8.2 mg). The dichloromethane extract from fruits (15.0 g) of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 180 g), was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, resulting in the fractions: hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:1); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1); EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Fractions CH2Cl2/ AcOEt (1:1) and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) were studied, as following described: the fraction CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1) (5.0 g) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography on silica gel using a gradient elution (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH), resulting in the four corresponding soluble fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (2.3 g) obtained from the last fractionation was several times chromatographed on silica gel and finally submitted to preparative HPLC to afford for limonoids 3 (19.4 mg), 5 (8.1 mg), and 6 (8.5 mg). Limonoid 4 (48.9 mg) was isolated from fraction EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) (4.6 g) of extract through several chromatographies on silica gel. Compounds 1-6 were identified through 1H and 13C NMR spectra, 1H - 1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC experiments and MS. The spectral data of 1 and 2 were in agreement with those published in the literature (Kuo et al., 1998; Moon et al., 2001) as well as the data of limonoids 3 (Luo et al., 2000), 4 (Paula, 1996), 5 (Govindachari & Kumari, 1998) and 6 (Leite et al. 2005a). Additionally, compounds 7 and 8 were characterized by comparison of 13C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975). The in vitro activity on T. cruzi of compounds 3 - 6 is described herein. On the other hand, the activities of compounds 1, 2, 7 and 8 were previously reported (Ambrozin et al., 2004; Tasdemir et al., 2006). Bioassay The bioassays were carried out according to the procedures described by Ambrozin et al. (2008). The activity of crude extracts was evaluated in triplicate at 4 mg/mL and pure substances at 250, 100, and 50 µg/ mL. It is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (µmol/L) for compounds 3-6 were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed against T. cruzi. The hexane extract (9.3 g) from branches of R. lancifolia (fresh weight: 1870 g) was fractionated through column chromatography on silica gel affording hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol fractions. The methanol fraction (1.5 g) was chromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, 3 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this work, we assessed the trypanocidal activity of 33 extracts of three Myrsinaceae and one Meliaceae species (Table 2). Eleven of them (33%) showed significant activity (lysis % > 50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. The majority of the extracts of C. fruticosa presented relevant activity. The best result was obtained from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH) that reduced 100% of the parasite number. The majority of the extracts of the three Rapanea species assayed did not present significant results, since several extracts led to the total lysis of the parasites and the red blood cells, as well. However, some extracts of these species showed high trypanocidal activity without affecting the red blood cells, such as the hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH). Similar studies involving the trypanocidal activity of Meliaceae and Rutaceae species have been reported by our group (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2008) showing that these plants can be considered a promising source of active compounds against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. Thus, the significant results obtained from the extracts of C. fruticosa are consistent with those previously reported for this family. The investigation of the methanol fraction of the active hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH) led to the isolation of the flavonol quercetin (1) Plant Plant part Solvent extraction Crude extract Lysis % Rapanea lancifolia (Myrsinaceae) hexane RLFLH 76.8 flowers dichloromethane RLFLD 72.2 methanol RLFLM TLa hexane RLLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RLLD TLa methanol RLLM TLa hexane RLBH 99.5 branches dichloromethane RLBD 7.0 methanol RLBM 47.69 hexane RGFLH TLa flowers dichloromethane RGFLD TLa methanol RGFLM TLa Rapanea guianensis (Myrsinaceae) hexane RGLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RGLD TLa methanol RGLM 68.5 hexane RGBH TLa branches dichloromethane RGBD TLa methanol RGBM 6.94 Hexane RUFRH TLa fruits dichloromethane RUFRD 69.4 Rapanea umbellata (Myrsinaceae) methanol RUFRM TLa hexane RURH TLa roots dichloromethane RURD TLa methanol RURM TLa hexane CFFRH 95.5 fruits dichloromethane CFFRD 97.7 methanol CFFRM 60.6 Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) Hexane CFLH 33.7 leaves dichloromethane CFLD 92.8 methanol CFLM 40.2 hexane CFBH 100 branches dichloromethane CFBD 76.1 methanol CFBM 42.0 Table 2.

Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Ana C. Leite, Artur Placeres Neto, Alessandra R. P. Ambrozin, João B. Fernandes, Paulo C. Vieira, Maria F. das G. F. da Silva et al. and the dihydrofl avonol taxifolin (2). Several biological activities have been reported for these fl avonoids. Quercetin (1), for example, presented antiprotozoal effect against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 = 14 µM), Trypanosoma brucei brucei (IC50 = 13.2 µM), Leishmania donovani (IC50 = 63.8 µM) (Camacho et al., 2002), T. brucei and T. rhodesiense (Williamson & Finnigan, 1978). In addition, this compound was described as a constituent of an aqueous extract from Lychnophora pinaster, Asteraceae which showed trypanocidal activity (Silveira et al., 2005). Recently, high leishmanicidal activity was described for such compound (Tasdemir et al., 2006). Compounds 1 and 2 were previously assayed on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, but showed low activity (Tasdemir et al., 2006). The relevant activity of the original extract (RLBH) is probably associated with the presence of other compounds or mixture of them. The mexicanolide limonoids 3-6, isolated from fruits of C. fruticosa, showed signifi cant trypanocidal activity (Table 3). They were obtained from the very active dichloromethane extract of fruits (Table 2, CFFRD, 97.7 %). This extract also afforded other limonoids (Leite et al., 2005a,b), which were not assayed herein. Recently, we reported the inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from T. cruzi. The results showed that crude extracts from C. fruticosa showed high ability to inhibit the enzyme activity (Leite et al., 2009). Thus, this specie could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against Chagas’ disease. In addition, the extracts from C. fruticosa showed high inhibition of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), a key enzyme from Leishmania that has been proposed as a target for the rational search of new leishmanicidal drugs (Ambrozin et al., 2005b). 5 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts The trypanocidal activity of flavone (7) and 7-methoxyflavone (8), isolated from the active hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH), was previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active fraction of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (Rutaceae), presented low activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (IC50 = 2116 and 787 µg/mL or 9531 and 1084 µmol/L, respectively) when compared with other flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004). Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites of C. fruticosa. As limonoids in the present work showed trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH extract may be associated with these compounds. Table 3.

The phytochemical study of three active extracts of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa led to the isolation of quercetin (1), taxifolin (2), flavone (7) and 7-methoxyflavone (8), which had showed weak activity against the trypomatigote forms of T. cruzi, and cipadesin (3), febrigufin (4), mexicanolide (5), and cipadesin A (6) that were appreciably actives. In addition, the trypanocidal activity of plants of Myrsinaceae family and limonoids 3-6 are been disclosed for the first time.

Box 4009, 01061-970, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil ReceiVed October 12, 2009 Two unusual pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2), were isolated from the leaves of Senna multijuga, together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin. The structures of the new alkaloids were established on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, in comparison with the standard compound physostigmine. Senna multijuga (Rich.) Irwin et Barneby (syn. Cassia multijuga Rich.) (Fabaceae) is a medium-size evergreen tree distributed widely in several Brazilian regions and other biomes from Africa.1 Several chemical studies of seeds, leaves, and roots have shown the occurrence of ﬂavonoids,2 anthraquinones,3,4 polysaccharides,5 and chromones.6 In Brazil, this species is popularly known as “pau- cigarra”, “caquera”, “topeiuia”, “aleluia”, and “canafı´stula” and is used as an ornamental plant in several regions of the country due to its attractive yellow ﬂowers.1,7 Although some species of the Senna (Cassia) genus have been reported to be an important source of phenolic compounds with diverse biological and pharmacological properties,8 only the seeds of S. multijuga are used for the treatment of ophthalmic and skin infections.2 However, no phytochemical study on the isolation of the secondary metabolites of this species has been conducted previously. As part of our ongoing research on Atlantic Forest plant species,9 we selected S. multijuga for study. From an ethanolic extract of the leaves were isolated two new pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′- multijuguinone (2), together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin.10 The occurrence of 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine alkaloids is unusual, and only one report has been described in the literature.11 Herein, we present the isolation, structure elucidation, and acetyl- cholinesterase-inhibitory properties of 1 and 2 by bioautography and microplate screening assays. The ﬁrst Dragendorff-positive compound, 7′-multijuguinone (1), was isolated as a white solid, mp 103-105 °C. The molecular weight of 1 was measured by HRESITOFMS, and the molecular formula was established as C18H29NO2, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5. The observed pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ was calculated for C18H30NO2, 292.2271. The UV spectrum, with absorption maxima at 222 and 287 nm, suggested the presence of a ketone and substituted aromatic moiety chro- mophores, respectively. IR absorption bands were assigned to hydroxy (3401 cm-1), carbonyl (1701 cm-1), and pyridine ring (1578, 1498, and 1464 cm-1) functional groups. Examination of the 1H, 13C, and DEPT NMR spectra recorded in CDCl3 (Table 1) showed the presence of a 2,3,6-trisubstituted pyridine ring [δ 7.00 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4), 6.84 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5); δ 145.3 (C-2), 148.8 (C-3), 122.7 (C-4), 120.8 (C-5), and 152.9 (C-6)], two methyl groups at δ 0.88 (t, H-12′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 13.9) and 2.47 (s, H-7, δC 18.5), and 10 methylenes at δ 2.67 (t, H-1′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 37.0), 1.64 (qt, H-2′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 30.2), 1.30 (m, H-3′, H-4′, and H-11′, δC 29.1, 29.0, and 22.4), 1.55 (qt, H-5′ and H-9′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 23.8 and 23.5), 2.36 (t, H-6′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.7), 2.37 (t, H-8′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.8), and 1.27 (m, H-10′, δC 31.4) and suggested the presence of a long linear side chain in the structure of 1. Furthermore, the side chain from C-1′ to C-12′ was deduced as being attached at C-6 of the pyridine nucleus by a gHMBC NMR experiment. Three-bond correlations were observed from H-5 to C-1′, H-1′ to C-5, and H-2′ to C-6 (Figure 1), supporting a 2-methyl- 3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine substitution pattern. The 7′-oxodode- cyl unit linked at C-6 is different from the long-chain pattern observed for other piperidine and pyridine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species. The position of the 7′-oxo group on the straight side chain was also deﬁned by gHMBC data analysis, for which the main correlations are represented in Figure 1.

The same pattern was observed with H-10′ and H-11′ when H-9′ and H-12′ were decoupled. The interpretation of these gHMBC sequence cross-peaks led to the establishment of the oxo function at the C-7′ position in the side chain. Furthermore, the gHMBC correlations of H-5 with C-3 (3J) and C-1′ (3J), together with that from H-7 to C-2 (2J) and C-3 (3J), allowed the hydroxy group to be located at C-3, which was consistent with a previous study on bioactive piperidine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species, with features similar to 1.9 Additionally, the gHMBC (1H-15N) spectrum showed a correlation between the nitrogen signal at δ 308.8 and signals at δ 2.67 (H-1′), 6.84 (H-5), and 2.47 (H-7). All this evidence agreed with the hydroxy group being located at C-3 and conﬁrmed the assumption made on the substitution pattern in pyridine alkaloid 1, which must be 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxododecyl) pyridine, similar to those found for piperidine alkaloids from other Senna (Cassia) species, except for the ketone group position in the side chain. These results suggested that the hydroxy group of this pyridine alkaloid is at C-3, which is not in agreement with those previously reported for a similar pyridine alkaloid from this species, with no hydroxy group being located at C-5.5 Compound 2 was obtained as a white solid, mp 71-73 °C, and gave a positive test with Dragendorff reagent. This compound showed spectroscopic features very similar to those of 1. The HRESITOFMS for 2 exhibited a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220), appropriate for the molecular formula C18H29NO3, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5 and being 16 mass units more than that of 1. The IR spectrum revealed the carbonyl absorption band at 1703 cm-1, a pyridine ring at 1584, 1489, and 1464 cm-1, and a hydroxy group band at 3392 cm-1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 showed signals very close to those of 1 (Table 1), as in the 1H NMR spectrum, which demonstrates the presence of a substituted pyridine ring system at δ 7.02 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4) and 6.85 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5). Additionally, the methyl hydrogens of CH3-7 at δ 2.48, analyzed together with 13C NMR data, conﬁrmed that the pyridine moiety is similar to that of 1. However, differences were evident between these compounds since the methyl group (CH3-12′) located in the side chain of 1 was replaced with a hydroxy methylene group in 2 at δ 3.67 (2H, t, J ) 6.5, H-12′, δC 62.5). These data, supported by the 13C NMR, DEPT, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY, and HOMODEC spectra, were in agreement with a pyridine system bearing one hydroxy group, one methyl, and one long-chain substituent. According to these data, the structure of 2 was determined as 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxo-12′-hydroxy- dodecyl)pyridine. All compounds isolated were screened for their AChE inhibitory activity, using bioautography and microplate tests, and the results are shown in Table 2. The preliminary TLC assay suggested moderate activity for compounds 1 and 2, which showed the minimum amounts of these alkaloids required for AChE inhibition of 0.75 and 0.18 µg, respectively, when compared with physostigmine (positive control, 0.05 µg). Rutin proved to be inactive, since the minimum amount required to show activity was over 100 µg. In addition, the microplate test conﬁrmed activity of the compounds 1 and 2, which exhibited weak AChE inhibition of 13% and 30% at 350 mM. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were recorded on a digital Microquimica MQAPF-302 apparatus and are uncorrected. UV data were acquired using an Amersham Ultrospec 2100 pro UV/ vis spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS10 FT- IR spectrometer coupled with an ATR accessory (the samples were pressed against a crystal of Ge). The 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT, NOESY, TOCSY, and HOMODEC) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, gH- MBC, and 1H-15N gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) at 30 °C and referenced using TMS (δTMS ) 0.00) as internal standard or residual solvent resonances of CDCl3 at δ 7.26 and 77.0 ppm, respectively, for 1H and 13C. High-resolution mass spectra with electrospray ionization were measured on an ultrOTOFQ (Bruker Daltonics) operating in positive mode. MeOH-H2O (4:1) was used as solvent system. TLC was performed on silica gel F254 plates (0.20 mm, Fluka), and spots were visualized under UV light (254 and 366 nm) and spraying with Dragendorff’s reagent or anisaldehyde-H2SO4, followed by charring for 5 min. Preparative TLC was carried out with Analtech 500 µm thick silica gel GF plates (20 × 20 cm, Uniplate) and visualized under UV light at 366 nm. Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) ProStar system equipped with a ternary pump model 340, a photodiode array detector model 330, and an autosampler model 410, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.52 software. Preparative HPLC separation was performed on a Varian PrepStar system equipped with a UV-vis detector model 320 and a binary pump model SD-1 manual injector, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.51 software. The columns used were a Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 4.60 mm, 5 µm) and a preparative Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 21.20 mm, 10 µm) protected by corresponding guard columns. All solvents used in the experimental procedures were distilled previously. For chromatographic analysis, HPLC-grade solvents (J. T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico) were employed. Water was puriﬁed immediately prior to use with a Milli Q plus system (Millipore, Milford, MA). Plant Material. Leaves of S. multijuga were collected in Araraquara (Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in July 2008 by one of the authors (M.P.). The plant was identiﬁed by Ineˆs Cordeiro from the Institute of Botany in Sa˜o Paulo-SP, Brazil. A voucher specimen (SP 384103) has been deposited in the herbarium of this institute. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered leaves (2.7 kg) were extracted with ethanol (8 L × 4) for ﬁve days at room temperature. Figure 1. Key gHMBC correlations for 1 and 2. Table 2.

Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 3 483 The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation, yielding a thick syrup (210 g). The crude ethanol extract (100 g) was further reconstituted in MeOH-H2O (4:1), ﬁltered, and then partitioned with n-hexane (250 mL × 5), CH2Cl2 (250 mL × 4), EtOAc (250 mL × 4), and n-BuOH (250 mL × 2), successively. All phases were concentrated under reduced pressure. The CH2Cl2 fraction (15.9 g) was dissolved in 500 mL of 5% HCl aqueous solution (ca. pH 2), ﬁltered, and partitioned with EtOAc (50 mL × 3) to remove nonbasic components. Then, NH4OH (30%) was added to the aqueous phase until ca. pH 8.5 and partitioned with CH2Cl2 (50 mL × 5). The latter organic layer was washed with H2O (100 mL × 3) and concentrated in order to give a neutral alkaloidal fraction (457 mg), which was puriﬁed by using preparative TLC with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc (1.5: 2.0:6.5) as developing solvent (×2). The bands with Rf values of 0.50 and 0.18 were scraped and eluted with MeOH, affording pure compounds 1 (49.1 mg) and 2 (60.5 mg). Fraction EtOAc (2.20 g) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (5:95 to 100:0) to yield six fractions (EtOAc-F1 to EtOAc- F6). Fractions EtOAc-F2 and EtOAc-F3 (527 mg) were further puriﬁed by preparative HPLC on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (40:60, ﬂow rate 19 mL/min, UV 254 nm), affording compound 3 (tR 17.4 min, 42.0 mg). Bioautographic Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of pure compounds was determined using a TLC bioautographic assay as previously described.12 The TLC layers were spotted with 1 and 2 in a range from 0.09 to 6.00 µg developed with n-hexane-EtOAc (1:4, v/v) and subsequently dried. The plates were then sprayed with the enzyme solution (6.66 U/mL), thoroughly dried, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min (moist atmosphere). Enzyme activity was detected by spraying with a solution consisting of 0.25% of 1-naphthyl acetate in EtOH plus 0.25% aqueous solution of Fast Blue B salt. Potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appeared as clear zones on a purple- colored background. Electric eel AChE type V (product no. C 2888, 1000 U) and the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Microplate Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of compounds 1-3 was evaluated using the modiﬁed methods of Ellman et al. and Rhee et al. in a 96-well microplate, as previously described.13 Using this method, the enzyme hydrolyzes the substrate acetylthiocholine, resulting in the production of thiocholine, which reacts with 5,5′-dithiobis(2- nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate-5-mercaptothio- choline and 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate and can be detected at 405 nm. To the 96-well plates were added 25 µL of an aqueous solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (15 mM), 125 µL of DTNB (3 mM) in buffer C, 50 µL of buffer B, and 25 µL of sample diluted in buffer A, to give a range of concentrations from 0.78 to 100 µg/mL. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s three times. Furthermore, 25 µL of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme was added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min two times. Any increase in absorbance due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the rate of the reaction before the addition of the enzyme from the rate of the enzyme reaction. The percentage of inhibition was calculated in comparison to a blank (10% MeOH in buffer A), and a positive control of physostigmine was used in the same range of concentrations. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8); buffer B, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction; buffer C, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.10 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2·6H2O. All of the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 7′-Multijuguinone (1): white solid; mp 103-105 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR νmax 3401, 2919, 2849, 1701, 1578, 1498, 1464, 1285, 1164, 1130, 832, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRESITOFMS m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO2, 292.2271); TLC Rf 0.50 (1.5:2.0:6.5 n-hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc). 12′-Hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2): white solid; mp 71-73 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR (ﬁlm) νmax 3392, 2931, 2851, 1703, 1584, 1489, 1464, 1290, 1248, 1160, 1128, 1048, 827, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRES- ITOFMS m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220); TLC Rf 0.18 (1.5:2:6.5 n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc).

Their cytotoxic activities against Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay at several concentrations for 24 h. Activities could be observed for egonol against C6 (IC50 ¼ 3.2 mg/mL) and Hep-2 (IC50 ¼ 3.6 mg/mL) cell lines, and for homoegonol against C6 (IC50 ¼ 4.9 mg/mL) and HeLa (IC50 ¼ 5.3 mg/mL) cells. Keywords: Styrax camporum; Styracaceae; Cytotoxic lignans; MTT assay 1. Introduction Styrax camporum Pohl (Styracaceae), known in Brazil as ‘‘estoraque do campo’’ or ‘‘cuia de brejo’’, grows in the States of Sa˜ o Paulo and Minas Gerais and is popularly used in gastrointestinal diseases [1]. Its reported uses have led to a study of the composition and antiulcer activity of the crude extract of the bark and the trunk [2]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the bark of S. camporum has resulted in the isolation of homoegonol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, sitosterol, vanillin and esters of cinnamic and ferulic acids [3]. The present article deals with the isolation from stems of S. camporum, and the identification and cytotoxicity evaluation of two benzofuran lignans, egonol (1) and homoegonol (2), and one furofuran lignan, ()syringaresinol (3), *Corresponding author.

Lignans are known to possess several biological activities [7–11], including antitumor, e.g., some podophyllotoxin derivatives, currently in clinical use, and cytotoxic, e.g., the benzofuran lignan licarin A which is active against KB cells. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compounds 1–3 against C6, Hep-2 and HeLa human carcinoma cells, the MTT spectrophotometric assay was used. 2. Experimental 2.1. Plant material The stems of S. camporum Pohl were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guac¸ u, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen (Young 07 – SP) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil. 2.2. General experimental procedures Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. 1H, 13C-NMR, DEPT and COSY spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-D6 using TMS as internal standard on a Bruker AC 200 or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS, on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. CC was performed over silica gel 60, 70–230 or 230–400 mesh or Sephadex LH-20 (Merck). TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates with detection pro- vided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and/or by spraying with 2% anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating. 2.3. Extraction and isolation The dried and powdered stems of S. camporum (470.0 g) were extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue (57.2 g) was taken up in aqueous MeOH (MeOH–H2O 80 : 20; 200 mL) and subsequently extracted with hexane. Sufficient water was added to the aqueous methanol fraction to make it up to 60% aqueous MeOH, which was extracted with CHCl3 followed by EtOAc. The CHCl3 fraction (3.8 g) was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane–EtOAc 1 : 1 v/v (A), CHCl3 (B), EtOAc (C), CHCl3–CH3OH 1 : 1 v/v (D), MeOH (E) and H2O (F) (300 mL each). After evaporation, fraction A (370 mg) was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl3–MeOH (98 : 2) and 62 fractions (15 mL each) were collected. Combined fraction 6–15 afforded 1 (34.3 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.26) and the combined fraction 17–18 afforded 2 (11.7 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.50). Fraction C (630 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 19 fractions (10 mL each) were collected. Combined fractions 2–7 (363 mg) were rechromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 52 fractions (3 mL each) were collected. Purification of the combined fractions 31–41 (98 mg) by prep. TLC (eluent CHCl3–MeOH 92 : 8) yielded 3 (5.1 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 320 H.L. Teles et al. Downloaded by [University of California Santa Cruz] at 17:19 28 November 2014 85 : 15, Rf 0.61). All known compounds were identified with the help of UV, IR, MS and NMR, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. 2.4. Cytotoxicity assay Cellular viability in the presence and absence of test compounds was determined using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, Dorset, U.K.) microculture assay [12]. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase reduces MTT to a blue formazan product with an absorbance at 560 nm in DMSO. Cells harvested in the log phase of the growth were counted and seeded (5 104 cells/well in 1 mL) in 48-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37C under 4.3% CO2 to allow cell attachment, cultures of the Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were treated with several test compound concentrations. Three replicate wells were set up for each experimental condition. After another 24 h incubation period, MTT (100 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution) was added, the plate was incubated for 3 h and unreduced MTT was removed. Acid isopropanol (HCl 0.3%; 100 mL) was added to dissolve the blue formazan. The absorbance at 560 nm was read by using a Pharmacia LKB-Ultrospec III spectrophotometer. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of test compound O HO OR2 OR1 OMe 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1' 6' 1'' 2'' 3'' 1 2 -CH2- Me Me R1 R2 O O OMe OMe HO OH OMe MeO 3 1 4 7 9 1' 4' 7' 9' Cytotoxic lignans from the stems of S. camporum 321 Downloaded by [University of California Santa Cruz] at 17:19 28 November 2014 resulting in a 50% reduction of absorbance compared to untreated cells in the MTT assay. Absorbances taken from cells grown in the absence of drugs were taken as 100% cell survival (control). For each compound the percent viability was plotted against concentration and the IC50 (concentration required to reduce viability by 50%) values were calculated for the three cell lines. This experiment was also performed with a positive control anticancer agent: streptonigrin. 3. Results and discussion The isolated lignans: egonol, homoegonol and () syringaresinol were evaluated for their cytotoxicities by the MTT method in the three cell lines: Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma). Each compound was tested at five different concentrations. The concentration–response curves thus generated were used to calculate the IC50 (table 1). The cytotoxic activity was expressed in terms of relative absorbance of drug-treated cells, in comparison to control cells. The results show a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect relationship for all the lignans and all the cell lines evaluated. Significant activities (IC50<10 mg/mL) could be observed for egonol against C6 and Hep-2 cell lines and for homoegonol against C6 and HeLa cells, when compared to the positive control streptonigrin activity (table 1). The activity of egonol against HeLa cells, homoegonol against Hep-2 cells as well as the activity of syringaresinol, the only furofuran neolignan under investigation in this study towards the three cell lines were moderate. It is interesting to note the significant differences of activity related to the lignan structure.

Introduction In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) we reported the isolation and characterization of two C- glycosylated anthrones (picramniosides D, E), and two C-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B), as well as emodin and umbelliferone, from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis Tul., a tree found in Central America. Further investigations aorded, in minor quantities, two new C,O-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picramnioside F (1), and an oxathrone, mayoside C (2), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (3) and 8-O-b-d-gluco- pyranosyl emodin (4). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of com- pounds 1 and 2, and the antifungal activity of the iso- lated compounds. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract from the bark of P. teapensis aorded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds 1± 4, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shi- madzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones 3 and 4 were identi®ed on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992). Compound 1 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 671 ([M+1]+), 693 ([M+Na]+) and 709 ([M+K]+), with the base peak at m/z 509 ([M+1- C6H10O5]+). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

E-mail address: djbf@power.ufscar.br (J.B. Fernandes). All of the spectroscopic characteristics of 1 were coincident with those of anthrones which we have pre- viously reported (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at lmax 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cmÿ1), ester carbonyl (1735 cmÿ1) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cmÿ1) groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at 7.4±7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of meta-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at 3.40±3.95, indicating sugar moieties. The presence of 33 carbons was evident from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at 95.8 and 105.4. Signals in the region of 62±81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D±E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agree- ment with lyxose (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on SolõÂs et al. (1995) which identi®ed the sugar of picramniosides A±C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-O were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments con®rmed only one CH2 signal at 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit. Complete assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experi- ments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In parti- cular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) 3J coupling between the ester carbonyl ( 164.7) and H-10, H-200 and H-600, indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-10 of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) 3J coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-50 ( 81.4), con- ®rming the position of the aglycone at C-50 of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a 3J correlation of the anomeric 838 T. RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 837±841 proton of the glucose unit (H-1, 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the O-glucose unit at C-8. The magnitude of the coupling constant between H-50 and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an eq±eq conformation for these protons. The con®guration of the lyxose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (SolõÂs et al., 1995; HernaÂ ndez- Medel et al., 1998; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-10 and H-20 (J=0 Hz) suggesting an eq±eq conformation for these protons. Likewise, the J value of H-5000 (12 Hz) indicated an ax±ax conformation for H-5000 and H-4000 in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety. Further observations helped to establish the con®gura- tion at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of 1 (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picramnioside E (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the fol- lowing expected dierences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to O-glucosylation at C-8. Compound 2 was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of 2 gave pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 709 ([M+Na]+) and 725 ([M+K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]ÿ), which was consistent with the molecular for- mula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS±MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (m/z 563), lyxose (m/z 432), CH2OH (m/z 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corre- sponding to emodin (269). As observed previously for the mayosides (HernaÂ n- dez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed the same pattern described for 1, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of 2 had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). O-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound 2 at ring A. Assignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with pub- lished data (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not aord all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1000 with C-1 ( 162) helped to con®rm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1000. Circular dichroism con®rmed the absolute con®guration at C-10 of 1 and 2 as S and R, respectively.

The compounds mayoside B, picramnioside E, 3, 4, emodin and umbelliferone were tested in the growth inhibition assay of Leucoagaricus gongilophorus, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. (1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds 3 and 4 presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in Sesamum indicum. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material. 3.

Plant material The bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San JoseÂ de la MontanÄ a, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica. 3.3. Isolation of constituents Dried and powdered bark of P. teapensis (615 g) was macerated with EtOH±H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was ®ltered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then n-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml minÿ1 UV detector at 254 nm), to aord compound 1 (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-O-b- (3) and 8-O-b-glucopy- ranosyl emodin (4). Further puri®cation of 3 (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and 4 (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described).

The clerodanes are a group of diterpenoids with interesting biological eﬀects such as antifungal,14 antileish- manial and antiplasmodial,15 antimalarial and antimycobac- terial,16 antitumor,17,18cytotoxic,1,14,16,19-31immunomodulatory,32 and trypanocidal activities.33 In our continuing investigation of the bioactive clerodane diterpenes from Casearia species, we undertook the ﬁrst phytochemical investigation of Casearia rupestris Eichler. This shrub or small tree grows up to 6.0 m in height and is found in Brazil (Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais States) and Bolivia (Sta. Cruz State) in the Cerrado, grasslands, and sometimes pastures, at altitudes of 350-500 m.34 Investiga- tion of the cytotoxic Et2O fraction yielded four new clerodane diterpenes (1-4) (Figure 1). Compounds 1 and 4 were acety- lated, resulting in two new derivatives (5, 6) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic activity of the diterpenes (1-6) against a panel of human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MDA/MB-435, HCT-8, and SF-295) has been evaluated. ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Investigation of the Et2O phase of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. rupestris led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, casearupestrins A-D (1-4). 2,7-Di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6) were obtained by acetylation of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. The structures (Figure 1) of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric data (IR, UV, NMR, and MS) and by comparison with NMR data of reported compounds.6 Casearupestrin A (1) was obtained as a white, amorphous solid ([R]24 D þ4.3 (c 1.0, MeOH)). The molecular formula Received: November 17, 2010 ABSTRACT: Four new clerodane diterpenes, casearupestrins A-D (1-4), were isolated from the leaves of Casearia rupestris. Compounds 1 and 4 were acetylated to yield 2,7-di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Casearupestrin A (1) exhibited the most potent activity against MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) cells, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin. 777 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 776–781 Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE C34H48O9 was determined by HRESIMS, based on the sodiated ion peak at m/z 623.3190 [M þ Na]þ (calcd 623.3190), which implies 11 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the presence of carbonyl esters (1746 and 1712 cm-1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions at λmax 223 nm (log ε 1.40) and 268 nm (log ε 1.50), corresponding to diene and dienone chromophores, respectively. The 13C and DEPT 135 NMR data showed the presence of 34 carbons divided into seven quaternary (including three carbonyl carbons), 13 methine, nine methylene, and ﬁve methyl carbons. The oleﬁnic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) revealed proton signals with characteristic cis/trans coupling at δH 5.06 (1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz, H-15), 5.30 (1H, d, J = 17.5 Hz, H-15), and 6.47 (1H, dd, J = 10.5, 17.5 Hz, H-14), indicating a terminal monosubstituted oleﬁnic moiety. Another terminal methylene, identiﬁed by two singlets at δH 4.94 and 5.03 (2H, H-16), was connected to a quaternary carbon (C-13). An additional oleﬁnic doublet was observed at δH 6.04 (1H, d, J = 4.0 Hz, H-3) and correlated to a methine carbon at δC 128.6 (C-3) in the gHMQC spectrum. Two deshielded acetal protons were observed at δH 6.35 (1H, t, J = 1.5 Hz, H-18) and 6.49 (1H, s, H-19), which correlated to methine signals at δC 96.3 and 99.8, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed the presence of two methyl groups at δH 1.06 (1H, brd, J = 4.0 Hz, H-17) and 1.07 (1H, s, H-20) and three oxymethines at δH 4.45 (1H, brt, J = 4.0 Hz, H-2), 5.18 (1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz, H-6), and 3.66 (1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz, H-7). The spectroscopic data of 1 (Tables 1 and 2) are in accord with the basic skeleton of clerodane diterpenoids previously isolated from Casearia species.10,18,35 The acyclic moiety at C-9, including the diene group, was deduced from the correlations of H-12 with C-11, H-14 with C-13 and C-16, H-15 with C-13 and C-14, and H-16 with C-14 (Figure 2). The position of the hydroxy group at C-7 was deduced by the long-range correlation of the oxy- methine signal at δH 3.66 (H-7) with δC 77.5 (C-6), 44.8 (C-8), and 11.7 (C-17) (Figure 2). A decadienoate moiety, identiﬁed by gHMBC and gCOSY correlations (Figure 2), was characterized by a Z- (δH 5.68, J = 11.5 Hz; 6.69, J = 11.5 Hz) and an E-double bond (δH 7.37, J = 14.0, 11.5 Hz; 6.16, J = 14.0, 7.0 Hz) and a triplet methyl (δH 0.98, J = 7.0 Hz). This same 2Z,4E-decadienoate unit has been veriﬁed in other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C. pitumba and C. arguta.6,36 Its position was determined at C-6 (δC 77.5), on the basis of the long-range correlation observed in the gHMBC spectrum between the oxymethine proton (H-6) and the carbonyl carbon (δC 167.3, C-10). Finally, since H-19 (δC 6.49) was correlated with the carbonyl group (δC 171.4) of one acetate unit, the second acetate unit (δC 171.8 and 21.0) must be located at C-18 (Figure 2). The relative conﬁguration of 1 was determined by using coupling constants, 1D-NOE data, and 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table 1 and Figure 3). The trans conﬁguration between the C-17 and C-20 methyl groups was shown by the chemical shift at δC 26.4 for C-20, which also supported a cis-A/B ring junction.3,5,10 The J values of 3.5 and 13.5 Hz for the coupling of H-10 and H-1 revealed that H-10 (rel-R) is in the axial position. The NOE enhancement between H-19 and H-10, and H-19 and H-7, indicated the same R-orientation to H-19 and H-7 (Figure 2). The large coupling constant between H-6 (δH 5.18 - 1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz) and H-7 (δH 3.66 - 1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz) supported their 1,2-diaxial relationship. The NOE interaction between H-6 (rel-β) and H-8 implied that H-8 and Me-17 were at axial and equatorial positions, respectively. A small coupling constant of 4.0 Hz for H-2/H-1 suggested an equatorial orientation for H-2 (rel-β), which was conﬁrmed by the broad triplet at δH 4.45 and the chemical shift of C-2 at δC 64.2. From the allylic coupling between H-3 and H-18 (J = 1.5 Hz) and NOE enhancement observed between H-18 and H-6 it can be deduced that H-18 also has a β-orientation. Therefore, casearupestrun A (1), a new clerodane diterpenoid, was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,- 8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-6-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,7-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The MS, UV, and IR data and the speciﬁc rotation value of casearupestrin B (2) were comparable with those of 1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Tables 1 and 2) revealed the same substituents and substitution patterns. However, changes in the chemical shift values related to H-6 (δH 3.75 - 1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz) and H-7 (δH 5.15 - 1H, t, J = 10.5 Hz) required placement of the decadienoate ester at C-7. The structure 2 was corroborated by the same correlations observed for 1 in the gHMQC, gHMBC, andgCOSY (Figure 2). The observed NOESY interactions and coupling constants for casearupestrin B (2) indicate the samerelative conﬁguration as 1 (Figure 3 andTable 1). Hence, casearupestrin B (2) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R, 9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,6-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The structures of the remaining two compounds can be ration- alized by comparison with the previous ones. Analysis of the NMR data of compound 3 revealed a strong similarity to com- pounds 1 and 2. However, the molecular formula C33H48O8, determined by the HRESIMS, revealed a sodiated ion peak at m/ z 595.3241 [M þ Na]þ, which implied 10 degrees of unsaturation. The main diﬀerence observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 3 in relation to compounds 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and 2) was the presence of signals at δH 3.36 (1H, s) and δC 55.4. These signals indicated that an acetoxy group at C-18 was replaced by a methoxy group, which was conﬁrmed by the gHMBC correlation between H-18 and the methoxy group. The relative conﬁguration of 3 was identical to 1 on the basis of the same NOESY interac- tions (Figure 3) and coupling constants. Thus, casearupestrin C (3) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-19-acetoxy-18, Figure 1. Structure of the clerodane diterpenes from Casearia rupestris. 778 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat.

Compound 4 had the molecular formula C36H50O10, deter- mined by HRESIMS (observed m/z 665.3297 [M þ Na]þ). The 1H and 13C NMR data of 4 (casearupestrin D) (Tables 1 and 2) were similar to those of 2 except for replacement of a hydroxy group at C-6 by an acetoxy group [δH 1.95 (3H, s), δC 171.5, δC 20.9]. The 1H and 13C NMR assignments of compound 4 were conﬁrmed by 2D NMR correlations, and its conﬁguration was established by the sign of the speciﬁc rotation, NOESY interac- tions, and coupling constants (Figure 3). Thus, casearupestrin D (4) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-6,18, 19-triacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)-decadienoyloxy]-2-hydro- xyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. Acetylation of 1 and 4 with Ac2O-pyridine yielded two new clerodane diterpenes derivatives, 5 and 6, respectively (Tables 1 and 2, NMR data). The products were named 2,7- di-O-acetylcasearupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearu- pestrin D (6). Theresultsofthebiologicaltestsofcompounds1-6areshownin Table 3. Casearupestrins A (1), B (2), and D (4) showed signiﬁcant cytotoxicity against four cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC50 values ranging from 0.10 to 1.3 μM. Com- pound 1 had an IC50 value of 0.36 μM against MDA/MB-435 and SF-295 cancer cell lines, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (Table 3). Acetylation of compounds 1 and 4 resulted in decreased cytotoxicity (Table 3), indicating that the C-2 OH group is essential for the cytotoxicity of these compounds. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 LC polarimeter. UV spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 A spectrometer.

Positive-ion HRMS spectra were recorded on an UltrOTOFq (Bruker Daltonics) ESI-qTOF mass spectrometer, using TFANa as the internal standard. Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 with UV-vis detector (model 330), using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Open column chromatography was performed over silica gel (40-63 μm, Merck) or silica C18 (40 μm, J. T. Baker) or on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were observed under UV light and by spraying the plates with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent, followed by heating at 120 C. Plant Material. Casearia rupestris leaves were collected in May 2007 in Campinas municipality, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil. The plant material was identified by one of the authors (R.B.T.). A voucher specimen (IAC41542) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Agron^omico de Campinas (S~ao Paulo State). Extraction, Isolation, and Chemical Transformation. The dried and ground leaves (0.46 kg) were exhaustively extracted by successive maceration with hexanes, EtOH, and H2O (3.0 L 3) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was concentrated under reduced pressure at 40 C to yield 30.0 g of a crude extract. This extract was then diluted with MeOH-H2O (3:1) and successively partitioned with hexanes (1.0 L 3), Et2O (1.0 L 3), and EtOAc (1.0 L 3). After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 10.8, 3.2, and 1.2 g, respectively. Part of the cytotoxic Et2O (3.0 g) fraction was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (78.0 3.0 cm) eluted with MeOH, to afford 38 fractions. These fractions were combined on the basis of their TLC profiles. Fraction 12 (1.7 g) was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel-C18, 78.0 3.0 cm, Table 2. 13C NMR Data for Compounds 1-6 (methanol-d4, 125 and 75 MHz, δ)a position 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.5, CH2 27.8, CH2 27.8, CH2 2 64.2, CH 64.2, CH 64.3, CH 64.0, CH 67.5, CH 67.4, CH 3 128.6, CH 127.0, CH 126.5, CH 129.3, CH 125.2, CH 125.3, CH 4 141.9, C 143.5, C 144.0, C 141.1, C 144.2, C 144.1, C 5 54.3, C 55.2, C 55.1, C 54.3, C 54.3, C 54.2, C 6 77.5, CH 75.2, CH 75.3, CH 75.8, CH 74.2, CH 75.6, CH 7 72.2, CH 76.1, CH 76.1, CH 73.5, CH 74.7, CH 73.4, CH 8 44.8, CH 43.1, CH 43.0, CH 42.7, CH 42.5, CH 42.5, CH 9 39.8, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 10 37.2, CH 36.5, CH 36.3, CH 37.3, CH 38.3, CH 38.3, CH 11 29.4, CH2 29.5, CH2 30.5, CH2 30.5, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 12 25.0, CH2 25.1, CH2 25.0, CH2 25.0, CH2 25.1, CH2 25.1, CH2 13 147.0, C 146.9, C 147.0, C 146.8, C 146.6, C 146.6, C 14 141.5, CH 141.6, CH 141.6, CH 141.5, CH 141.4, CH 141.4, CH 15 113.2, CH2 113.1, CH2 113.1, CH2 113.2, CH2 113.2, CH2 113.2, CH2 16 115.5, CH2 115.7, CH2 115.6, CH2 115.1, CH2 115.9, CH2 115.9, CH2 17 11.7, CH3 11.5, CH3 11.5, CH3 11.3, CH3 11.3, CH3 11.3, CH3 18 96.3, CH 97.2, CH 105.7, CH 96.0, CH 96.0, CH 95.9, CH 19 99.8, CH 100.1, CH 99.7, CH 99.5, CH 99.5, CH 99.5, CH 20 26.4, CH3 26.2, CH3 26.3, CH3 26.0, CH3 25.8, CH3 25.8, CH3 10 167.3, C 168.0, C 168.0, C 167.4, C 166.8, C 167.4, C 20 115.9, CH 116.3, CH 116.3, CH 115.7, CH 114.6, CH 115.1, CH 30 147.7, CH 147.1, CH 147.1, CH 148.1, CH 148.9, CH 148.2, CH 40 128.3, CH 128.3, CH 128.2, CH 128.0, CH 128.1, CH 128.0, CH 50 147.2, CH 146.9, CH 146.8, CH 148.0, CH 148.5, CH 148.0, CH 60 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 70 30.5, CH2 30.6, CH2 29.5, CH2 29.4, CH2 29.3, CH2 29.4, CH2 80 32.4, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 90 23.4, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.4, CH2 23.5, CH2 100 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 2-O2CCH3 172.1, C 21.0, CH3 172.1, C 21.0, CH3 6-O2CCH3 171.5, C 20.9, CH3 171.6, C 20.6, CH3 171.5, C 20.9, CH3 18-OCH3 55.4, CH3 18-O2CCH3 171.8, C 21.0, CH3 172.0, C 21.0, CH3 171.9, C 20.9, CH3 172.0, C 20.9, CH3 171.8, C 20.9, CH3 19-O2CCH3 171.4, C 21.8, CH3 171.5, C 21.8, CH3 171.9, C 21.9, CH3 171.9, C 21.9, CH3 170.9, C 21.7, CH3 171.0, C 21.7, CH3 a 13C NMR data were assigned by DEPT-135 and gHMQC experiments; multiplicities were determined with the assistance of DEPT-135 and 90 experiments. 780 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J.

Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes (1-6) was tested against four tumor cell lines: SF-295 (human glioblas- toma), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), HL-60 (human leukemia), and MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM gluta- mine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 C with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 μL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 μg/mL) dissolved in DMSO were added to each well. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 μg/mL) was used as the positive control. The proliferation of tumor cells was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan pro- duct. At the end of 69 h incubation, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL of MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA).37 ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.

In addition, it is becoming very difﬁcult to discover new leads structures solely by synthetic means [1]. Therefore, modern strategies for discovering new agrochemical, i.e. insecticides, herbicides, etc. are focused on natural products, because they often have a reduced environmental impact, are biodegradable and may have new sites of interaction and speci- ﬁcity. In a program oriented towards the discovery of novel photo- synthetic inhibitors, we identiﬁed diverse secondary metabolites such as chromenes, benzofurans, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, lac- tones, and terpenes from selected Mexican plants [2]. Furoquinoline alkaloids have attracted much interest due to their broad range of biological activities including various physiological and pharmaco- logical activities [3,4]. In a previous work bioactive constituents from Swinglea glutinosa (Rutaceae) [4–7], and from Hortia superba (Rutaceae) were isolated and characterized. Quinolone alkaloids, ﬂindersine, N-methyl-ﬂindersine and acridone alkaloids inhibit the light reactions of photosynthesis [8]. The acridone alkaloids that contain 2,3,5,6-dehydro-4-oxopiperidine nucleus were the most ac- tive. As a contribution on the research of the Rutaceae family, in this work we report the isolation of ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids: evoli- trine (1), kokusaginine (2), c-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4) and mac- ulosidine (5) (Fig. 1) from a Brazilian tree Balfourodendron riedelianum. The plant is used in the Brazilian folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments [9]. In the search for natural product that may have herbicide activity, we studied ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids and found that four of them act as photosynthetic inhibitors. We investigated the mechanism of action of furoquinoline alkaloids 1– 5 on the light reaction of photosynthesis and their possible targets on the electron transport chain on thylakoids and leaves discs. Among the techniques suitable for assessing the electron transport ﬂow in the light reactions of photosynthesis on plants subjected to chemical stress, polarography (measuring oxygen evolution and using appropriate electron acceptors, donors and inhibitors) and ﬂuorescence induction curves of chlorophyll a of photosystem II (PS II) were employed in the present work. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence data were analyzed by the ‘‘JIP-test analysis’’ [10]. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jphotobiol were isolated from Balfourodendron riedelianum (Rutaceae) as pre- viously published [11] and were assayed on the light reaction of photosynthesis in order to evaluate their activity. Stock solutions of 1–5 were prepared using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as solvent and its maximum concentration in the medium was less than 0.5%. Log P Parameters and Molar volume of the alkaloids were deter- mined for each compound by the program Chem stech from www.ACD labs.com. 2.2. Puriﬁcation and Isolation of the furoquinoline alkaloids (1–5) The dichloromethane extract (2.1 g) obtained from the stem barks of B. riedelianum was subjected to a counter current chroma- tography, in the RLCC (Rotation Locular Counter Chromatography, RLCC-1000, Eyela ceramic bomb VSP-3050) apparatus using chlo- roform/methanol/isopropanol/water (45:60:2:40), as stationary phase in an automatic collector (Eyela fraction collector DC-120). The apparatus loop was 3.0 mL to give a group of 24 fractions in a chloroform solution stationary phase (0.3626 g), which was subjected to a column over Sephadex LH-20 (430 mm 30 mm, 300 g) and the elution was carried out with methanol (100%) to give 7 fractions. From the fraction 3 (0.0902 g) the alkaloid 3 was obtained and from the fraction 6 (0.0137 g) 1 and 2 were isolated, and the compound 4 was isolated from the fraction 5 (0.0437 g). These metabolites were identiﬁed by spectroscopic and spectro- metric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, including 2D experiments (HSQC and HMBC), the data were compared with previous report [12–14]. A solution of methanol/H2O (25%) of the methanol extract (58.6 g) obtained from the stem bark of Balfourodendrum riedelia- num and then subjected to a liquid extraction to get n-hexane (5.5 g), dichloromethane (26.4 g) and ethyl acetate (2.8 g) frac- tions. The dichloromethane fraction was subjected to a chromato- graphic column (silica ﬂash, 47.0 5.5 cm). The gradient elution was carried out with hexane to methanol, giving eleven fractions. The fraction 9 (1.45 g) gave rise to a new chromatographic column [silica ﬂash + ﬂorisil (1:1), 70.0 2.5 cm] with gradient of elution (hexane to methanol) providing seven fractions (I–VII). The frac- tion IV (0.95 g) was subjected to another silica ﬂash/Florisil (1:1) column (71.0 2.5 cm, eluted with gradient of hexane – ethyl ace- tate), giving ﬁve new fractions (A–E). The fraction E (0.06 g) was subjected to a preparative thin-layer chromatography (20 20 cm, 1 mm), eluted with dichloromethane (100%) to isolate maculosidine (5) (0.02 g). This compound was identiﬁed with spec- troscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, as previ- ously reported [12–14]. 2.3. Chloroplasts isolation and chlorophyll determination Intact chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves (Spinacea oleracea L.) obtained from a local market as previously described [15,16]. Chloroplasts were isolated with a medium that contained: 400 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and buffered with 3 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, then they were re-suspended in the same medium and stored as a concentrated suspension in the dark for 1 h at 0 C. 2.4. Measurement of ATP synthesis To measure ATP synthesis, intact chloroplasts (20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were broken by osmotic rupture in the following low-buffered solution: 100 mM sorbitol, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM KCN, 50 lM methylviologen (MV) (as electron acceptor at FX level), 1 mM K+-tricine (pH 8.0), and 1 mM ADP, pH adjusted to 8.0 with KOH. The ATP synthesis was determined titrimetrically using a microelectrode Orion model 8103 Ross connected to a Corning potentiometer model 12, with expanded scale as previ- ously reported [15,17]. The linear rate of alkalization in the light was calibrated by back-titration with saturated HCl, the ATP formed was calculated as lmol ATP mg Chl1 h1. 2.5. Measurement of non-cyclic electron transport rate The Light-induced non-cyclic electron transport activity from water to MV was determined with an oxygen monitors YSI (Yellow Springs Instrument) model 5300 using a Clark type electrode as previously published [15,18]. Chloroplasts (equivalent of 20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were freshly lysed in 3 mL of the basal electron transport reaction med- ium: 100 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KCN, 30 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, and 50 lM MV and measured the basal electron ﬂow by polarography. Phosphorylating non-cyclic elec- tron transport from water to MV was measured as basal non-cyclic electron transport medium except that 1 mM ADP and 3 mM KH2- PO4 were added to the reaction medium. Uncoupled electron trans- port from water to MV was tested as the basal non-cyclic electron transport, and 6 mM NH4Cl was added as uncoupler to the med- ium. All reaction mixture was illuminated for 1 min with an actinic light of a projector lamp (GAF 2660) passed through a 5 cm ﬁlter of CuSO4 at 2% w/v.

Uncoupled photosystem II (PS II) and Uncoupled photosystem I (PS I) electron ﬂow determination Uncoupled PS II from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) [19] was monitored polarographically. DCBQ accepts elec- trons at the D1 protein, and thus we measured the electron trans- port from water to QB. The reaction medium for assaying PS II activity was the same used for basal electron transport, except that MV was omitted and 1 lM 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4- benzoquinone (DBMIB), 100 lM DCBQ and 6 mM NH4Cl were added. Partial reaction of PS II electron transport from water to so- dium silicomolybdate (SiMo) was determined as in PS II with the same basal electron transport medium without MV, and 50 lM SiMo and 10 lM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were added [20]. These electron ﬂow activities were monitored with a yellow spring instrument (YSI) oxygen monitor, model 5300 using a Clark type electrode. Uncoupled PS I electron transport was determined using the basal electron transport medium, plus 10 lM DCMU (to inhibit PSII at QB level), 100 lM of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) were re- duced with 300 lM ascorbate and uncoupled with 6 mM NH4Cl [21]. The I50 value for each activity was extrapolated using the graph of percentage of activity versus concentration of compounds. I50 is the concentration producing 50% inhibition of the activity. 2.7. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II measurements in thylakoids Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence transients were measured with a Handy-PEA (Plant Efﬁcient Analyzer, from Hansatech, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, UK) as previously described [16]. The maximum ﬂuores- cence yield from the sample was generated by illumination for 2 s with continuous light (650 nm peak wavelength, intensity equivalent of 2830 lmol photons m2 s1 and gain of 0.7.) pro- vided by an array of three light-emitting diodes. The reaction med- ium used was that employed in basal non-cyclic electron transport measurements with MV. To monitor Chl a ﬂuorescence transients, aliquots of dark-adapted thylakoids for 5 min containing 60 lg of Chl were transferred to ﬁlter paper by gravity with a dot-blot appa- ratus (Bio-Rad, United States) in order to ensure a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of thylakoids. The ﬁlter paper was dipped immediately in 3 mL of the medium with different concen- trations of the tested compounds, and the control contained med- ium plus the amount of DMSO employed for each compound at the different used concentrations. Chloroplasts inﬁltrated with 10 lM DCMU and chloroplasts pre- viously treated with 0.8 M Tris ((hydroxymetyl)-aminomethan) were used as positive control. Chloroplasts were incubated with slight agitation for 30 min at 4 C with 0.8 M Tris at pH 8.0 [22]. The OJIP transients were analyzed according to the JIP test and the measured parameters were: ﬂuorescence intensity level (Fo) when plastoquinone electron acceptor pool (QA) is fully oxidized and ﬂuorescence level when QA is transiently fully reduced (FM). F1 is the ﬂuorescence intensity level at 0.05 ms, F2 at 0.1 ms, F3 at 0.3 ms, F4 or FJ at 2 ms, F5 at 30 ms. Area is the area over the curve between Fo and FM, and relates the pool size of PS II electron trans- port acceptors [23]. From these parameters other derived parame- ters were calculated (Table 1) with the program Biolyzer HP3 (from Laboratory University of Geneva; available at http://www. unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen). The ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a transients were normalized using the equation Vt = (Ft Fo)/ FM Fo), and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients is called ‘‘relative variable ﬂuorescence’’, if plotted versus time revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band near to 2 ms, is an indication of the Q A concentration is increased [10]. VOJ is the relative variable ﬂuorescence between Fo and FJ and is calculated as VOJ (t) = FVt/(FJ Fo) = (Ft Fo)/(FJ Fo) and plotted versus time. If a K-band appeared near to 0.3 ms indicate a damaged in the water splitting system on thylakoids [10]. 2.8. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence measurements in spinach leaf discs Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence on discs from dark-adapted spinach leaf was measured with the same equipment and conditions used for thylakoids. Fifteen spinach leaf discs (7 mm diameter) were placed in each Petri dishes with 10 mL of modiﬁed Krebs solution which contained: 115 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM Na2SO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 25 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4), then were incubated for 4 h at room tempera- ture, after this time, different concentrations of compound was added to each Petri dish. The leaf discs were incubated for 4 h more in the presence of the compounds, then, they were dark adapted for 30 min and afterwards the ﬂuorescence of the chlorophyll a was measured. The same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used for the samples treated with the analyzed compounds was added to the control samples for eliminating the solvent effect. 2.9. Plant material for in vivo assays The seeds of Physalis ixocarpa and Lolium perenne, a weed spe- cies, were sown in 12 cm diameter pots and were watered daily in the greenhouse at 25–30 C. After 15 and 18 days of emergence for P. ixocarpa and L. perenne, respectively, the plants were selected for similar size and were sprayed manually with the compounds 1 and 2 at concentrations of 150 and 300 lM. A stock of 20 mM of each compound was prepared in DMSO and an aliquot of this solu- tion was taken to obtain the desired concentration in an aqueous suspension containing 0.05% w/v of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The control group was sprayed with dis- tilled water containing the same amount of DMSO and Tween-20. 2.10. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence determination in intact leaves in vivo This was performed at room temperature with a portable Handy PEA apparatus [11] in the leaves of dark adapted-plants for 15 min both on the control and on the treated plants after 24, 40 and 72 h of being sprayed with the compounds. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Inhibition of ATP synthesis To know the effect of the furoquinoline alkaloids 1–5 on photo- phosphorylation, they were assayed on freshly lysed spinach chlo- roplasts. ATP synthesis was inhibited by 1, 2, 4 and 5 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The I50 values for this activity were 83.5 and 59.0 lM for 1 and 2, respectively; 4 and 5 had the same value 50.5 lM and 3 was almost inactive and it was not further studied (Fig. 2). 3.2. Effect of the natural furoquinoline alkaloids on chloroplast electron transport rate The light-dependent photophosphorylation is coupled to elec- tron transport rate and can be inhibited by different ways: by blocking the electron transport, by direct inhibition of the H+-ATP- ase, or by uncoupling the ATP synthesis process from the electron transport [24]. To elucidate the mechanism of action of the furo- quinoline alkaloids on photosynthesis, their effects on non- cyclic electron transport (basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled) from water to MV were investigated. 38 T.A.M. Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 Furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited basal, phosphor- ylating, and uncoupled electron transport as their concentrations increased up to 200 lM. The I50 values for uncoupled electron transport rate were 21.0, 18.6, 23.4 and 22.8 lM, respectively (Table 2). Compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the electron ﬂow (in basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions) and ATP syn- thesis; therefore they act as Hill reaction inhibitors. Other natural products that act as Hill reaction inhibitors are the biﬂavonoid iso- lated from Seleginella lepydophylla, robustaﬂavone [25] or the fur- anoditerpene canophyllol isolated from Celastrus vulcanicola) [16]. 3.3. Localization of furoquinoline alkaloids interaction sites on the light reaction of photosystem PS II and photosystem PS I and partial reactions To localize the inhibition site of the alkaloids on the thylakoid electron transport chain, their effects on PS II, PS I and photosys- tems partial reactions were tested using artiﬁcial electron donors and acceptors, as well as appropriate inhibitors [21]. Table 3 shows that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the uncoupled PS II electron ﬂow from water to DCBQ; 1 inhibited PS II 100% at a concentration of 300 lM, however, alkaloids 2, 4 and 5 inhibited partially this activity (81%, 67% and 89%, respectively) at the same concentration (300 lM); therefore, 1 was the most active compound inhibiting the PS II electron transport. To further localize the inhibition site of the furoquinolines on the PS II electron transport chain, their effects were measured on the electron ﬂow from water to SiMo (SiMo ac- cepts electrons from pheophytin, so in this way the electron ﬂow measurements are from the water splitting enzyme to pheophy- tin). The results indicate that1, 2, 4 and 5 did not affect this partial reaction, since the rate of treated thylakoids were similar to the control (data not shown), therefore, all active furoquinoline alka- loids inhibited the electron transport chain beyond the pheophytin site [20]. The polarographic measurements suggest that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited electron transport between QA and QB of PS II, at the D1 protein by displacing QB, similar to how DCMU herbicide acts. The mechanism action of 1, 2, 4 and 5 is similar to other natural prod- ucts like trachyloban-19-oic acid [26], ﬂindersine [4]. Uncoupled PS I electron transport rate was measured by polar- ography from reduced DCPIP to MV by using increasing concentra- tions of the alkaloids tested, in order to ﬁnd if they affect this photosystem. The results of these studies showed that the rate for control and treated samples were similar, therefore the furo- quinoline alkaloids do not interact with PS I electron transport chain (data not shown). 3.4. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in thylakoids in the presence of the furoquinoline alkaloids To corroborate the polarography results about the interaction site of the furoquinoline alkaloids at PS II, ﬂuorescence of chloro- phyll a were measured on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts incu- bated for 5 min in the dark at room temperature. Control chloroplast contained the amount of DMSO used for each treat- ment, the treated chloroplasts contained various concentrations of the compounds (each concentration was measured three times); chloroplasts incubated with Tris and 10 lM DCMU were used as positive control (Fig. 3). Chlorophyll a induction curves of thylak- oids control (Fig. 3) showed an OJIP sequence similar to that previously described for plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria [27] except that phase IP was in part suppressed due to the effect of MV [28]. The chloroplasts inﬁltrated with DCMU and the control samples showed almost identical FM level (Table 4). However, the FM level of treated chloroplasts decreased respect to the control, while the Fo was not been affected by almost all the compounds tested; only 1 increased lightly the Fo level.

In Fig. 4A, a small H-band was observed after 100 ms and closer to 1000 ms, this band is due to the electron acceptor MV ef- fect [28]. In Fig. 4B, a K-band is observed in chloroplasts treated with Tris 0.8 M. Even though a small K-band is also observable in chloroplasts treated with DCMU, this band can be to the solvent ef- fect of the ethanol where the DCMU was dissolved [28], however, the furoquinoline alkaloids were dissolved in DMSO as solvent and it have not any effect on the ﬂuorescence induction curve. Furthermore, the Fm value in the presence of DCMU plus MV is similar to the control sample (Table 4). In chloroplasts treated with furoquinolines alkaloids plus MV decreased Fm and the parameters derived from the JIP test (see Table 1) had similar behavior with DCMU treatment (Fig. 5), with the parameter dR0 exception, [it reﬂects the efﬁciency with which an electron can move from the reduced electron acceptors coming of the intersystem to the PS I (reducing site)] [29]; this parameter was slightly increased by the furoquinoline treatments (with DCMU treatment it drastically diminished). Values like REo/CS, REo/RC and uRo decreased with all treatments, being more drastic for DCMU. These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electrons transport chain in two sites, one at donor and the other on the acceptor side in PS II (Fig. 5). The effect of furoquinoline alkaloids site at the donor side was detected only by the technique of ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a of PS II, and not by polarography technique [10]. 3.5. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in leaf discs To know if the alkaloids can reach their targets on the photo- synthesis electron transport chain, ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a induction curves were measured in discs obtained from fresh spinach leaves. In Fig. 6A the OJIP sequences for control and discs treated with the most active furoquinoline 1 (in this case MV was omitted from the medium) showed a rise in the J peak. In discs treated with 1, 2, and 5 at concentration of 400 lM, the differences between normalized curves and control showed a J-band (Fig. 6B). Furthermore 4 did not show any effect on the discs ﬂuorescence (data not shown). J-band for 1 was bigger than for 2 and 5 (Fig. 6B). Also 1 and 2 showed a small K-band while compound 5 lacks this band (Fig. 6C). When the transients were normalized between FM and F5, a band in the IP region ap- peared (30 ms to about 300 ms) for compounds 2 and 5 (Fig. 6D).

In addition, the quantum yield for the reduction of PSI end acceptors per photon absorbed also increased. These results suggest that end acceptors of PS I cannot be reduced because the electrons from PS II are not available. The parameters for 2 and 5 are similar to the con- trol (Fig. 7) indicating that these compounds do not reach com- pletely their target.

In vivo assays In order to conﬁrm if 1 can penetrate the intact whole leaf and affect the plants in vivo, this compound was sprayed on the leaves of L. perenne and P. ixocarpa plants after 15 days of growth in the green house. Studies of chlorophyll a Fluorescence were performed on the plants after 24, 48 and 72 h of being sprayed with 1 at 150 and 300 lM. The results showed non-signiﬁcant inhibiting growth effect. These results suggest that 1 does not overcome the natural barriers provided by the plants, since the chlorophyll a and dry bio- mass of these plants were not affected by 1 (data not shown). 4. Conclusions The results indicated that furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited ATP synthesis and electron transport in spinach chloro- plasts while 3 was inactive. The inhibition site of alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 was located at the acceptor side of PS II by polarographic technique. When these results were corroborated by chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II data; we found that the donor side of PSII is inhibited by these furoquinoline alkaloids. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence measurements on leaf discs treated with furoquinoline alka- loids showed changes in the induction curve of ﬂuorescence only with 1, transforming the OJIP trace at OJ step, showing a J band which indicates that only 1 can reach its inhibition target. However when 1 was sprayed on intact whole leaves, this compound could not penetrate the leaves plant natural barriers. Furthermore, 1 with two methoxy groups has the lowest molar volume unlike com- pounds 2, 4 and 5 with 3 methoxy groups and therefore larger mo- lar volumes which make more difﬁcult their translocation in the leaves. Also alkaloid 3 has a lower molar volume, but it has a LogP value of 2.70, similar to compounds 4 and 5. However, 1 has a high- er LogP value of 3.20 suggesting that this compound fulﬁlls the speciﬁc structure requirements for inhibiting PSII electron trans- port chain in leaf discs that the other furoquinoline alkaloids stud- ied lack these characteristics.

Among the plant families studied, Meliaceae and Ruta- ceae are perhaps the most promising (Schoon- hoven, 1982), at least partly due to the presence of limonoids and triterpenoids characteristic of the Rutales order. The biological activity of limo- noids from Rutales has been reviewed (Cham- pagne et al., 1992). Some neem-based botanical insecticides have already been developed and marketed (Schmutterer, 1990, 1995, 2005). Carapa guianensis Aublet, also called andiroba, andiroba-saruva, iandirova, carapá, and nandiro- ba (Lorenzi and Matos, 2002), is a tall Meliaceae tree growing wild throughout South America, West India, and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in ﬂ ooded areas of the Ama- zon rainforest (Ambrozin et al., 2006). From the nuts of this plant an oil, called andiroba oil, is ex- tracted, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, as analgesic, anti-inﬂ ammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and as an anticancer remedy (Bickii et al., 2000; Gilbert et al., 1999; MacKinnon et al., 1997; Moura et al., 2002). Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, together with 2 – 5% of unsaponiﬁ able material. In addi- tion, from several parts of Carapa guianensis li- monoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, ﬂ avo- noids, and diglycerides have been isolated (Lavie et al., 1973; Marcelle and Moto, 1975; Ollis et al., 1964, 1970; Qi et al., 2003, 2004). Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae) (“canjarana”) is a native tree of economic impor- tance in Brazil. It is a dioecious tree with wide- spread distribution in the neotropics, extending from Costa Rica to southern Brazil and northern Argentina. According to Pennington et al. (1981), it inhabits mainly nonﬂ ooded evergreen lowland or lower hill rain forests. In the present paper, triterpenoids and limo- noids isolated from C. canjerana and C. guianensis were examined for their effects on the fall army- worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepi- doptera: Noctuidae). S. frugiperda is a major pest of many crops in the Americas and one of the most important pests of tropical maize, causing up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity of this crop in Brazil (Cruz et al., 1996).

Cabraleadiol, 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide, and 7-deacetoxy-7-oxoge- dunin prolonged the larval phase similar to the control (gedunin) of approximately 1.2 days at 50.0 mg kg–1. The highest insecticidal activity was obtained for β-photogedunin. Key words: Spodoptera frugiperda, Limonoids, Triterpenoids Unauthenticated Download Date | 9/2/15 2:05 PM 246 A. L. F. Sarria et al. · Triterpenoids and Limonoids against Spodoptera frugiperda Material and Methods Plant material Cabralea canjerana was collected at the Univer- sidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, Brazil, and identiﬁ ed by T. D. Pennington from the Royal Bo- tanic Garden, Kew, UK. A voucher (1842; 1983) is deposited in the herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestal Dendrologia, Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The arillus of the Carapa guianensis seeds were supplied by Cognis Brasil Ltda., Av. Nações Uni- das 10989, 4° andar, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds isolation Fruits (460 g) and seeds (200 g) from C. can- jerana were extracted with ethanol, at room tem- perature for three times. The ethanolic extract (88.3 g) of the fruits was submitted to liquid-liquid partition with 120 ml methanol/water (3:1, v/v) solution. This solution was partitioned with dif- ferent solvents to give fractions in n-hexane (fr- Hex, 47.4 g), dichloromethane (fr-CH2Cl2, 5.4 g), ethyl acetate (fr-EtOAc, 4.4 g), and methanol (fr- MeOH, 11.9 g). The fraction fr-Hex (2.8 g) was submitted to a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 45 fractions of 50 ml) using n- hexane/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase, yielding nine fractions (fr-Hex.1 to fr-Hex.10) after TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2 (102 mg) was re- chromatographed by column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20 as stationary phase (col- umn 3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., 26 fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol/dichloromethane, 1:1, v/v), yielding three fractions (fr-Hex.2.1 to fr- Hex.2.3) after comparison by TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2.2 (88.6 mg) was rechromato- graphed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 3.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 10 fractions of 5 ml each) eluted with n-hexane/acetone (9:1, v/v) to afford ocotil- lone (1, 16.3 mg) and cabraleadiol (2, 24.4 mg). The ethanolic extract (14.3 g) of the seeds of C. canjerana was chromatographed on microcry- stalline cellulose-D and silica gel (column 5.0 x 22.0 cm i.d., fractions of 250 ml each) using n-hex- ane (250 ml) followed by dichloromethane (1 l), acetone (1 l), and methanol (1 l) as mobile phas- es yielding 13 fractions (EES-1 to EES-13). The fraction EES-2 (1.72 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 69 fractions of 10 ml each) using n-hexane/ acetone/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase to yield eleven fractions (EES-2.1 to EES- 2.11) which were joined based on TLC. The frac- tion EES-2.6 (293.4 mg) was rechromatographed by column chromatography using a Sephadex LH- 20 column (3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol), yielding ﬁ fteen fractions (EES-2.6.1 to EES-2.6.15). The fraction EES-2.6.7 afforded methyl angolensate (3, 48.2 mg). The fraction EES-2.7 (230.6 mg) was re- chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 35 fractions of 10 ml each), using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as mobile isocratic phase, yielding seventeen fractions (EES- 2.7.1 to EES-2.7.17). The fraction EES-2.7.9 af- forded 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide (4, 63.7 mg). The arillus ethanolic extract (10.0 g) of C. gui- anensis was submitted to vacuum chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase (70 – 230 mesh, column 30 x 5 cm i.d.) and n-hexane followed by CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH (1 l each) as mobile phases, yielding four fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (3.8 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica gel (230 – 400 mesh, 30 x 4 cm i.d., n-hexane and acetone gradient as elu- ent, starting with pure n-hexane and ﬁ nishing with pure acetone, 32 fractions of 200 ml each) to give ﬁ ve fractions (Ac1 to Ac5). The fraction Ac3 (3.0 g) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 10 x 3 cm i.d.) eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2 to MeOH, 28 frac- tions of 50 ml each) to yield ten fractions (Ac3.1 to Ac3.10). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5, 24.4 mg) and β-photogedunin (6, 14.4 mg) were isolated from fraction Ac3.2 by recycling HPLC (Asahipack polymeric column; eluent, methanol/ dichloromethane, 7:3, v/v; ﬂ ow, 4 ml min–1). Biological activity Larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Labora- tory of Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil, and reared on semi-artiﬁ cial diets (Kasten et al., 1978; Parra, 1986). They were maintained in an incubation chamber with a pho- toperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark, (70 5)% rela- tive humidity, and (25 1) °C. For each treatment and control, 30 neonate larvae of S. frugiperda were used. A solution of compound was added to ascorbic acid (1.56 g; an Unauthenticated Download Date | 9/2/15 2:05 PM A. L. F. Sarria et al. · Triterpenoids and Limonoids against Spodoptera frugiperda 247 ingredient of the diet). After evaporation of the solvent, the mixture was incorporated into the semi-artiﬁ cial diet in which bean and wheat germ are the basic ingredients (Kasten et al., 1978) at ﬁ nal contents of 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg kg–1 for 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), and 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg–1 for ocotillone (1), cabraleadiol (2), methyl angolensate (3), 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide (4), and β-photogedunin (6). The diet for the con- trol was prepared similarly but without the tri- terpenoids or limonoids. Gedunin (7) was used as positive control. The diets were placed in previously sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm × 2.5 cm), into which larvae of S. frugiperda were introduced individu- ally. The pupae were weighed 1 d after pupation and were transferred to plastics cups, where they stayed until the emergence of adults. Daily obser- vations were made and the following parameters were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal phases, (2) weight of pupae, and (3) percentage of dead insects (mortality) at the end of each phase. Statistics Data were submitted to an analysis of variance ANOVA (Zar, 1974), and the averages were com- pared applying the Tukey test (P 0.05). Each tube containing one insect, independent of the developed phase, was considered as one replicate, therefore, the number of replicates was different for each treatment. For evaluation of the mortal- ity of the larvae and pupae, the experimental unit was constituted by the mean of ﬁ ve tubes contain- ing one larva each, with six replications by treat- ment. Results and Discussion The triterpenoids 1 and 2 and limonoids 3 and 4 were isolated from the fruits and seeds of C. canjerana and the limonoids 5 and 6 from the aril- lus of C. guianensis (Fig. 1). Their structures were conﬁ rmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and comparison with data from the literature (Braga et al., 2006; Ambrozin et al., 2006). Compounds 1 – 6 were incorporated in the semi-artiﬁ cial diet. 2, 4, and 5 affected larval de- velopment (Table I), and only 6 affected pupal development at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg [(8.5 1.64) days and (8.9 1.25) days, respec- tively, control (10.1 1.45) days]. Larvae fed with Fig. 1.

Sarria et al. · Triterpenoids and Limonoids against Spodoptera frugiperda semi-artiﬁ cial diet treated with 5 and 6 showed signiﬁ cant reduction in the pupal weight (17.8 and 31.5 mg at 50 mg kg–1, respectively), compar- able to the effect of gedunin (7, 27.2 mg, Table I). Larvae fed with semi-artiﬁ cial diet treated with 2, 4, and 5 at 50.0 mg kg–1 prolonged the larval time for approximately 1.2 days similar to gedun- in, suggesting that these compounds act as larval growth inhibitors (Table I). Compounds 2 and 4 prolonged the larval phase, although no alteration in pupal weight was ob- served. Tanzubil and McCaffery (1990) observed that larvae treated with low doses of azadirachtin produced pupae with a weight comparable to that of the controls, suggesting that they did not expe- rience any severe feeding inhibition. Compound 5 also effected prolongation of the larval phase followed by reduction of the pupal weight. The larvae treated with 5 showed prolonga- tion of the larval phase by 1.4 days (at 50.0 mg kg–1) and 2.6 days (at 100.0 mg kg–1) when compared with the control (14.9 days, Table I). The reduction of the pupal weight was by 17.8 and 25.8 mg at 50.0 and 100.0 mg kg–1, respectively, when compared with the control (262.5 mg, Table I). Larvae treated with 6 at 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg–1 presented reduction of the pupal weight by 30.0, 31.1, and 31.5 mg, respectively, when com- pared with the control (272.7 mg, Table I). This compound reduced the duration of the pupal phase by 1.2 days and that of the larval phase was increased by 0.6 days, while gedunin affected Table I.

Ocotillone (1) isolated from the leaves of Dysoxylum malabaricum (Govindachari et al., 1994) was tested against Spodoptera litura and showed excellent PFI (percentage feeding in- dex) values comparable to those of azadiradione, epoxyazadiradione, and limonin (Govindachari et al., 1995). Methyl angolensate (3) exhibited insecticidal activity against S. litura in no-choice tests (Ab- delgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh et al., 2002; Powel et al., 1991), and this result agrees with that observed in the present work. Isolated from diethyl ether and acetone extracts of the stem bark of Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) 3 showed antifeedant activity by the conventional leaf disc method on the third-instar larvae of Spodop- tera littoralis (Boisd., Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at 500 μg ml–1 (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh et al., 2002) in a study examining struc- ture-insect antifeedant relationships of plants belonging to the Rutales order. In a dual-choice antifeedant bioassay against Spodoptera litura L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), methyl angolensate (3) showed a PFI of 65.3, near to that of cedrelone (51.5). Two limonoids (sandoricin and 6-hydroxy- sandoricin) isolated from seed extracts of Sando- ricum koetjape Merr. (Meliaceae), which possess chemical structures similar to that of methyl an- golensate (3), showed signiﬁ cant antifeedant ac- tivity against the fall armyworm (S. frugiperda), incorporated in diet at 25 ppm, and similar activ- ity against the European corn borer (ECB), Os- trinia nubilalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), at 200 ppm. Toxicity results for both insects indi- cated that continued feeding on diets containing sandoricin or 6-hydroxysandoricin at the 200 ppm level would result in nearly 100% mortality prior to pupation (Powell et al., 1991). β-Photogedunin (6) presented the highest in- secticidal activity against S. frugiperda causing mortality of 53.3% in the larval stage and 20.0% in the pupal phase at 50 ppm. These results agree with those of Céspedes et al. (2000), who tested an epimeric mixture of photogedunin and their corresponding acetates and observed that these compounds caused signiﬁ cant mortality of S. fru- giperda larvae (45% to 100% at 10.0 to 52.0 ppm) after 7 days, as well as growth reduction, and pho- togedunin acetates showed the highest insecticid- al activity at 10.0 ppm with 17% survival. Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 6 showed moderate in- secticidal activity at 50.0 mg kg-1 with 40.0, 40.0, 33.3, and 53.3% mortality, respectively, for the lar- val phase. Although the compounds tested here were less active than the positive the control ge- dunin (7, 63.3%), the use of these compounds, in particular 6, is suggested for the control of S. frugiperda. Comparison of the activities of 6 and 7 suggests that oxidation of the furan ring led to a decrease in the insecticidal activity.

The results showed that compound 1 had no eﬀect when compared to the control group, which was treated with the vehicle (DMSO). Compound 2 was able to induce a slight increase in cell proliferation of HeLa (37% of increase) and CHO (38% of increase) cell lines. Analysis of compound 3 showed that it has potent cytotoxic activity against both cell lines, with an IC50 of 8.0 lM. Biological analyses using the phytopathogenic fungi Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides revealed that also 2 showed potent antifungal activity compared to nystatin. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction This study was conducted as part of our ongoing biopro- specting program Biota-FAPESP, that aims to discover potential antitumor, antifungal and antioxidant agents pro- duced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado. Among sixty screened fungi, Periconia atropurpurea, isolated from the leaves of Xylopia aromatica, was chosen for detailed chemical inves- tigation due to its antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides, i.e. as demon- strated by the ethyl acetate extract which in turn led to isolation of two new compounds: 6,8-dimethoxy-3-(20- oxo-propyl)-coumarin (1) and 2,4-dihydroxy-6-[(10E,30E)- penta-10,30-dienyl]-benzaldehyde (2), as well as the known compound periconicin B (3) (Kin et al., 2004). In this paper, we report the isolation, structure elucidation and biological evaluation of compounds 1–3 using two mammalian cell lines, human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), as well as two phytopathogenic fungi, Clad- osporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides. 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion The known compound periconicin B (3) was identiﬁed by comparing its physical and spectroscopic data with liter- ature values (Kin et al., 2004). It was described for the ﬁrst time from the fungus Periconia sp., and has not been reported from any another fungal source. The new compound 6,8-dimethoxy-3-(20-oxo-propyl)- coumarin (1), was obtained as a brown amorphous powder and had a molecular formula of C14H14O5, as revealed by analysis of the positive ion HRESI-MS data. The UV spec- tra showed four bands at 215, 231 (sh), 249 (sh) and 287 nm, with the latter being typical of an aromatic chro- mophore. The IR spectrum had bands at 1740 and 1630 cm1, suggesting conjugated carboxyl and carbonyl groups, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1, two methoxy moieties were identiﬁed by observation of signals at d 3.80 (3H, s, 6-OCH3) and d 3.89 (3H, s, 8- OCH3). A spin-system corresponding to a 1,2,3,5-tetrasub- stituted benzene ring was also assigned on the basis of the signals at d 6.76 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-5) and d 6.86 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-7). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum dis- played an isolated oleﬁnic hydrogen signal at d 7.80 (1H, s, H-4) and resonances at d 3.68 (2H, s, H-10) and d 2.19 (3H, s, H-30) attributable to a 20-oxo-propyl group. These data were consistent with the corresponding 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) and with similar information from analogues published in the literature (Dittmer et al., 2005), which suggested that 1 could possess a coumarin skeleton. This was inferred by signals at d 142.1 (C-4), d 100.0 (C-5), d 102.9 (C-7) and d 119.6 (C-10) observed in the 13C NMR spectrum, and additional resonances at d 161.0 (C-2), d 125.0 (C-3), d 156.0 (C-6), d 147.0 (C-8) and d 139.0 (C-9) observed in the gHMBC spectrum. In addition, two signals at d 55.7 (6-OCH3) and d 56.5 (8- OCH3), and three at d 44.2 (C-10), d 205.0 (C-20) and d 29.6 (C-30) were observed and attributable to methoxy and oxo-propyl groups, respectively. Data from the gHMBC and NOESY experiments (Table 1) supported these conclusions and enabled completion of the structure of 1. Correlations of the H-10 protons with oleﬁn (C-4) and carboxyl (C-2) carbons supported the location of a 20-oxo-propyl group at C-3. NOESY experiments were conducted on all hydrogens of 1 and showed a NOE corre- lation between 6-OCH3/H-5, H-5/H-4, H-4/H-10, H-10/H- 30 and H-7/8-OCH3 thereby conﬁrming unambiguously Table 1 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectroscopic data for compounds 1(1H, DMSO-d6; 13C, CDCl3 + CD3OD)a and 2 (DMSO-d6)a Position 1 2 1H (d) 13C (d) gHMBC NOESY 1H (d) 13C (d) gHMBC NOESY 1 111.2 2 161.0 b 165.3 3 125.0b 6.18 d (2.5) 101.4 C-1, C-2, C-4 – 4 7.80 s 142.1 C-9 H-5, H-10 165.1 5 6.76 d (2.5) 100.0 – H-4, 6-OCH3 6.49 d (2.5) 105.8 C-3, C-4, C-6, C-10 H-20 6 156.0b 143.7 7 6.87 d (2.5) 102.9 C-9 8-OCH3 8 147.0b 9 139.0b 10 119.6 10 3.68 s 44.2 C-20, C-2, C-4 H-4, H-30 7.16 d (15.5) 124.8 C-5, C-6, C-30 1-COH, H-30 20 205.0b 6.71 dd (10.5, 15.5) 134.0 C-6, C-40 H-5, H-40 30 2.19 s 29.6 C-20 H-10 6.27 ddd (0.5, 10.5, 15.0) 131.7 – – 40 5.95 dq (6.5, 15,0) 132.3 C-20, C-50 H-20, H-50 50 1.80 dd (0.5, 6.5) 18.1 C-30 H-40 1-COH 10.10 s 192.3 C-1, C-2, C-6 H-10 6-OCH3 3.80 s 55.7 C-6 H-5 8-OCH3 3.89 s 56.5 C-8 H-7 a Chemical shifts (relative to TMS) are in (d) ppm, coupling constants in Hz in parentheses.

Teles et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 2686–2690 2687 the positions of the methoxy and oxo-propyl groups (Fig. 1). 2,4-Dihydroxy-6-[(10E,30E)-penta-10,30-dienyl]-benzalde- hyde (2) was obtained as a colorless amorphous powder and was assigned the molecular formula of C12H12O3, via analysis of the negative ion HRESI-MS. The UV spectra showed bands at 261, 294 and 339 nm, assuring the pres- ence of an aromatic ring. The IR spectrum had bands at 3470 and 1629 cm1 accounting for the aromatic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 displayed a signal at d 10.10 (1H, s, 1-COH) attributable to an aldehyde group. The spin-system corre- sponding to a tetra-substituted benzene ring was identical to that obtained for 1 and was observed at d 6.18 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-3) and d 6.49 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-5). The spectrum also displayed four resonances at d 7.16 (1H, d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-10), d 6.71 (1H, dd, J = 10.5, 15.5 Hz, H- 20), d 6,27 (1H, ddd, J = 0.5, 10.5, 15.0 Hz, H-30) and d 5.95 (1H, dq, J = 6.5, 15.0 Hz, H-40) attributable to oleﬁnic hydrogens in an S-trans arrangement, suggesting the pres- ence of a conjugated diene with a trans/trans conﬁguration (E/E). In addition, a signal at d 1.80 (3H, dd, J = 0.5, 6.5 Hz, H-50) was attributable to a vinyl methyl moiety in a vicinal coupling with H-40 and allylic coupling with H- 30. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals (Table 1), including one for the aldehyde group at d 192.3 (1-COH). The penta-10,30-dienyl moiety was conﬁrmed by assignment of the carbon resonances at d 124.8 (C-10), d 134.0 (C-20), d 131.7 (C-30), d 132.3 (C-40) and d 18.1 (C-50), these being substantiated by the gHMQC correlations observed. Data from the gHMBC experiment (Table 1) also supported these conclusions. Correlation of the 1-COH hydrogen with C-2 and C-6, and between H-20/C-6 and H-5/C-10 conﬁrmed the linkage of the aldehyde at C-1 and of the penta-dienyl unit at C-6, respectively. 1D-TOCSY experi- ments, showed a complete set of sequence correlations for the penta-dienyl unit. 1D-NOE experiments were also conducted showing NOE between 1-COH/H-10, H-10/H- 30, H-5/H-20, H-20/H-40 and H-40/H-50 corroborating the E/E suggested arrangement (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of an endophytic fungus from Xylopia aromatica (Annonaceae) and the ﬁrst isola- tion of this class of compounds from P. atropurpurea. Compounds 1–3 were evaluated against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides using direct bioau- tography (Rahalison et al., 1991). Only compound 2 exhib- ited strong antifungal activity against both fungi, showing a detection limit of 1.0 lg, comparable to nystatin (used as a positive control). Compound 1 did not show any anti- fungal activity, and 3 showed a relatively weak detection limit of 25.0 lg. Compounds 1–3 were also evaluated for cytotoxicity using HeLa and CHO mammalian cell lines. Compound 1 showed no activity to either cell lines, when compared to the vehicle-treated cells. Compound 2 was able to induce proliferation of HeLa cells (maximum of 37% of increased proliferation at 2.0 lM) and CHO cells (maximum of 38% of increased proliferation at 20.0 lM). Results obtained with compound 3 showed that it is a potent cytotoxic agent against the two mammalian cell lines analyzed. Compound 3 decreased cell viability of HeLa and CHO cells, with an IC50 of 8.0 lM, showing potency similar to that of cis- platin, a well known antineoplastic agent (IC50 5.0 lM), which was used as a cytotoxic positive control. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure UV spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer UV–Vis Lambda-14P spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Impact-400 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded using a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, with TMS as an internal standard. HRESI mass spectra were obtained using a Bruker Daltonics (UltroTOF-Q) mass spectrometer. Analytical HPLC was performed with a Var- ian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm · 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230–400 mesh and normal-phase silica gel G60 (Merck). TLC was per- formed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and pre- coated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anis- aldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm · 21.2 mm) preparative column. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated Xylopia aromatica (Lamarck) Martius plant material was collected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Experimental de Araraquara’’, Araraquara, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in 2001. The botanical identiﬁcation was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was depos- ited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SP 142.360). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus For isolation of the endophytic fungus, adult and healthy leaves were selected and subjected to surface steril- ization. They were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, and then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solu- tion for 5 min and aqueous ethanol (3:7, %) for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 cm2 pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dex- trose-agar) and gentamicin sulfate (0.5 mg/ml) with approximately 3–4 pieces on each dish. The material was incubated at 25 C for 10 days and the endophyte P. atro- 2688 H.L. Teles et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 2686–2690 purpurea was isolated by replication and preserved in sterile water (Maier et al., 1997). The fungus was identiﬁed by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning using rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and deposited in the (Colec¸a˜o Micolog- ica de Lavras, at the Universidade Federal de Lavras fun- gal herbarium with the accession number CML 631). 3.4. Growth and production of the crude extract The fungus was cultivated using three diﬀerent culture media: PDB (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/1.0 l H2O), Czapek (30.0 g saccharose; 3.0 g NaNO3; 1.0 g K2PO4; 0.5 g MgSO4; 0.5 g KCl; 0.01 g Fe2(SO4)3/1.0 l H2O) and Czapek + polystyrene resin XAD-2. For the ﬁrst medium, were used 2 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (500 ml), each con- taining 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 ml distilled water which were autoclaved at 125 C for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA (potato extract, dextrose and agar) medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of the P. atropurpurea isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 · 200 ml). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase in vacuo yielded a brown solid residue (129 mg). The above process was scaled up (4.0 l of PDB in 20 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) after the antifungal bioactivity against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was detected, aﬀording 1.44 g of EtOAc extract (A). For the other two culture media the process described was directly scaled up, using 5.0 l of Czapek med- ium [aﬀording 200 mg of EtOAc extract (B)] and 1.0 l of Czapeck + 50.0 g of XAD-2. After incubation, the resin XAD-2 was separated from medium by ﬂotation and extracted with MeOH aﬀording 700 mg of MeOH extract (C). 3.5. Antifungal assay C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sph- aerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay, and were maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds 1–3 were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using solution (10 ll) contain- ing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.0 and 1.0 lg. After eluting with CHCl3–CH3OH (9:1), they were sprayed with spore sus- pensions of the fungi (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). Nystatin was employed as positive control. 3.6. Biological assays using mammalian cell lines Biological assays aiming to determine cell viability after treatment with the compounds were performed as described previously (Teles et al., 2005). Brieﬂy, HeLa and CHO cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Gai- thersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). A stock solution (20.0 mM) was prepared by dissolving compounds 1–3 in DMSO (vehicle). The ﬁnal concentrations (200.0, 20.0 and 2.0 lM) were achieved by direct dilution into the cell medium. The compound 3 was also diluted in the following concentrations: 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 50.0 lM. After addition of the compound or the vehicle, cells (104 cells/well plated 24 h before) were analyzed after a period of 48 h using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983; Rubinstein et al., 1990). 3.7. Extraction and isolation EtOAc extract A (1.44 g) was fractionated by CC using silica gel and eluted with a CHCl3–MeOH gradient (95:5 ! 100% MeOH) aﬀording 15 fractions. Fraction 01 (290 mg) was fractionated by CC using Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4, 200 ml); CH2Cl2-ace- tone (3:2, 200 ml), CH2Cl2-acetone (1:4, 200 ml), acetone (150 ml) and MeOH (150 ml), aﬀording six sub-fractions. Sub-fraction 01 (11 mg) was further puriﬁed using reversed-phase prep. HPLC [k = 235 nm, 10.0 ml/min, CH3CN–H2O (9:1)] aﬀording 1 (2.8 mg, Rt = 17 min). EtOAc extract B (200 mg) was fractionated by CC using reversed-phase silica gel and eluted with a MeOH–H2O gradient (25:75 ! 100% MeOH) aﬀording four fractions. Fraction 4 (80.5 mg) was puriﬁed by HPLC using phe- nyl–hexyl phase in preparative column [k = 220 nm, 15.0 ml/min, MeOH–H2O (6:4)] aﬀording 3 (16 mg, Rt = 20 min). The MeOH extract C (700 mg) was fraction- ated by CC using reversed-phase silica gel and eluted with a MeOH-H2O gradient (20:80 ! 100% MeOH) aﬀording 05 fractions. Fractions 4 (160 mg) and 3 (41 mg) were puriﬁed by HPLC using a phenyl–hexyl phase preparative column and using the following chromatographic conditions: [k = 225 nm, 15.0 ml/min, MeOH–H2O (63:37)] and [k = 233 nm, 15.0 ml/ min, MeOH–H2O (50:50)], aﬀording 2 (20.0 mg, Rt = 22 min) and an additional sample of com- pound 1 (6.4 mg, Rt = 20 min), respectively. 3.7.1. 6,8-Dimethoxy-3-(20-oxo-propyl)-coumarin (1) Brown amorphous powder.

Bioactivity- guided fractionation from hexane extract of Himatanthus sucuuba barks utilizing Cladosporium sphaerospermum led to the isolation of iridoids plumericin and isoplumericin, which showed higher inhibition against C. sphaerospermum than the antibiotic nistatin. Besides bioactive iridoids were isolated the inactive triterpenes lupeol cinnamate, ααααα-amyrin cinnamate and lupeol acetate. Keywords: Himatanthus sucuuba; iridoids; triterpenes. ARTIGO INTRODUÇÃO Himatanthus sucuuba (Spruce) Woodson (Apocynaceae) é uma planta conhecida na região norte do Brasil como sucuuba, janaguba ou sucuba. Esta planta é amplamente utilizada na medicina popular como antitumoral, antifúngica, vermífuga e anti-anêmica1. Estudos anteriores revelaram a presença de depsídeos, terpenos e iridóides em H.sucuuba2,3. Dentre os iridóides foram encontra- dos a fulvoplumierina, isoplumericina e plumericina, de compro- vada ação antineoplásica, antiflogística e antimicrobiana4-10. Os depsídeos isolados de H.sucuuba apresentaram atividade como inibidores da enzima beta monoamino-oxidase (MAO-B)3. No entanto, como foram encontrados nas cascas podem não ser pro- venientes da planta e sim de líquens infestantes. No presente trabalho são descritos os resultados do estudo fitoquímico do extrato hexânico das cascas do caule de H.sucuuba. Este extrato é constituído basicamente por uma mistura de ésteres triterpênicos, que corresponde aproximada- mente a 7% do peso do extrato. Estes ésteres triterpênicos já foram descritos no gênero Himatanthus11,12. A atividade fungicida apresentada pelo extrato foi monitorada por bioauto- grafia, utilizando-se o fungo fitopatogênico Cladosporium spha- erospermum13-14. A análise das frações bioativas por CGAR- EM, RMN 1H e 13C revelou a presença dos iridóides plumeri- cina 1 e isoplumericina 2. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O extrato hexânico das cascas do caule foi submetido a bioautografia, utilizando o fungo Cladosporium sphaerosper- mum. A cromatoplaca de sílica foi eluída com uma mistura de hexano e acetato de etila (6:4). Uma zona de inibição intensa na cromatoplaca indicou a presença de substâncias fungitóxicas. O extrato hexânico foi fracionado em coluna de SEPHADEX- LH 20, usando hexano, diclorometano, acetona e metanol como eluentes. Das oito frações obtidas, a segunda e a terceira frações apresentaram zona de inibição na bioautografia. A cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria de massas destas duas frações mostrou a presença dos iridóides plumericina 1, isoplumericina 2, e de uma mistura de ésteres triterpênicos das séries lupano e ursano, como constituintes em maior proporção na mistura. Ao extrato hexânico dissolvido em clorofórmio adicionou- se etanol. Este procedimento levou à obtenção de um sólido amorfo que foi cromatografado em coluna de gel de sílica. A eluição da coluna com uma mistura de hexano/benzeno em gradiente de polaridade crescente forneceu uma mistura de duas substâncias e um sólido cristalino. A análise da mistura, por cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria massas, mos- trou o mesmo íon molecular de m/z 556 para as duas substân- cias, compatível com a fórmula molecular C39H56O2. Foram observados íons característicos de triterpenos das séries lupano de m/z 189 (32%) e ∆12 -urseno ou oleaneno de m/z 218 (46%), este último proveniente de um rearranjo de tipo retro- Diels- Alder15-16. O íon de m/z 408 (M+•-148), resultante da perda de C9H8O2 , acompanhado do fragmento de m/z 131 (100%) leva- ram a suposição da presença de um grupamento cinamoíla no esqueleto triterpênico17-18. Os espectros de RMN 13C (desacoplado e DEPT 90o e 135o) da mistura registraram os pares de deslocamentos químicos 124.5 (CH) e 139.8 (C), e 109.6 (CH2) e 151,1 (C), característicos para as ligações duplas C(12) - C(13) da série urseno e C(20)- C(29) do grupo isopropilideno do esqueleto lupano19-20, respec- tivamente. A unidade cinamoila foi confirmada através dos des- locamentos químicos em δ 128,2 (C-2’ e C-6’), 129,0 (C-3’e C- 5’), 130,3 (C-4’) e 134,3 (C-1’) do anel aromático e em 119,0, 144,4 e 166,3 da unidade (CH=CH-COO). O par de dubletos no RMN 1H em δ 7,70 (1H, J=16Hz) e 6,48 (1H, J=16 Hz) e 7,65 (1H, J=16Hz); e 6,42 (1H, J=16 Hz.) mostram que a ligação dupla tem configuração E21-22. A hidrólise básica desta mistura levou a obtenção de ácido cinâmico, lupeol e α-amirina23, cujas as estruturas foram confirmadas através de seus espectros de massas (CGAR-EM) e co-injeção com padrões. O sólido cristalino 5 mostrou o íon molecular de m/z 468, compatível com a fórmula molecular C32H52O2, e fragmentos no espectro de massas característicos do esqueleto lupano19-21,24-26. A unidade acetil foi caracterizada pelos espectros de RMN 1H e 13C de 519-21, 24-26, que foi identificado como acetato de lupeol. O fracionamento guiado por bioensaio das frações bioativas levou à obtenção de uma mistura dos iridóides 1 e 2. A análise QUÍMICA NOVA, 21(6) (1998) 703 por CGAR-EM mostrou que ambos os iridóides tem o mesmo peso molecular (M+• 290, C15H14O6). Os fragmentos de m/z 258 (M+•-32, 42%) e de m/z 230 (M+•-60, 85%) são provenientes da perda de MeOH e de formiato de metila, enquanto o de m/z 193 (M+•-97, 78%) é resultante da perda do anel da lactona. O espectro de RMN 1H desta mistura registrou um par de dubletos de quartetos em δ 7,14 (1H, J=1,0 e 7,0 Hz) e 6,80 (1H, J=1,0 e 7,0 Hz), que foram atribuídos ao hidrogênio olefínico no C-13 da plumericina 1 e isoplumericina 2, respectivamente. A avaliação biológica foi feita utilizando a suspensão de esporos do fungo fitopatogênico Cladosporium sphaerospermum. Pelo método da autobiografia utilizando diferentes concentra- ções das substâncias 1 e 2 , verificou-se que o limite de deteção, tanto para plumericina 1 quanto para isoplumericina 2 está abai- xo de 1µg. Este resultado indica uma atividade fungitóxica para estes iridóides cinco vezes maior do que o observado para o antibiótico nistatina (5µg), usado como padrão. foi tratado com clorofórmio e etanol, precipitando 2,0 g de um sólido branco amorfo. 200 mg deste sólido foram cromatografa- dos em coluna de gel de sílica (hexano/benzeno em gradiente crescente de polaridade), fornecendo uma mistura constituída de 3 e 4 (58,8 mg) e um sólido 5 (25,2 mg). 6,0 g da fração hexânica bruta foram ainda cromatografados em coluna aberta utilizando SEPHADEX LH-20 (60 g) como fase estacionária e como eluentes hexano, diclorometano, acetona e metanol em gradiente de polaridade crescente fornecendo: (A) C6H14 (5,0 g); (B) C6H14:CH2Cl2 (8:2; m=0,5 g); (C) C6H14:CH2Cl2 (6:4; m=0,3 g); (D) C6H14:CH2Cl2 (2:8; m=0,05 g); (E) CH2Cl2:C3H6O (8:2; m=0,08 g); (F) CH2Cl2:C3H6O (6:4; m=0,03 g); (G) CH2Cl2:C3H6O (2:8; m=0,008 g); (H) MeOH (m=0,002 g). A cromatografia em camada fina das frações obtidas indi- cou a presença de substâncias com o mesmo Rf nas frações B e C. Estas frações foram reunidas (m=0,8 g) e cromatografadas em coluna de gel de sílica tendo como eluentes hexano, diclo- rometano, acetato de etila e metanol em gradiente de eluição. Após a bioautografia das frações (vide procedimento abaixo), a fração eluída com CH2Cl2:AcOEt (8:2,108 mg) foi cromato- grafada em coluna de gel de sílica com hexano/acetato de etila em gradiente de eluição, obtendo-se oito frações das quais a fração eluída com C6H14 : AcOEt (7:3) é uma mistura consti- tuída pelos iridóides 1 e 2 (16,3 mg). Hidrólise da mistura de 3 e 4 - 45 mg deste material foram refluxados com 6 ml de solução metanólica de KOH a 5% em 60 ml de hexano. Após evaporação do metanol e adição de água, extraiu-se a solução com clorofórmio, obtendo-se uma fração insaponificável, que foi identificada por co-injeção em CGAR como lupeol e α-amirina. A fração aquosa alcalina acidificada com HCl e extraída com acetato de etila forneceu um sólido cristalino que foi identificado por comparação com amostra autêntica, através de CCD, IV e co-injeção em CGAR, como o ácido cinâmico. Bioensaio - A análise do extrato hexânico foi realizada em cromatografia de camada fina, tendo como sistema de solven- tes hexano:acetato de etila (6:4).Após o registro das bandas cromatográficas que absorveram na luz ultravioleta, fez-se a aplicação da suspensão, contendo Cladosporium sphaerospermum, sobre a cromatoplaca com subsequente deposição em atmosfera úmida para incubação por um período de dois a três dias. Suspensão de Cladosporium sphaerospermum - Uma solu- ção contendo KH2PO4 (7 g), Na2HPO4. 2H2O (3 g), KNO3 (4 g), MgSO4. 7H2O (1 g) foi autoclavada a 120oC por 20 minu- tos. A 60 ml desta solução foram adicionados 10 ml de uma solução de glicose a 30% e, em seguida, adicionou-se o fungo Cladosporium sphaerospermum até obter-se uma suspensão.

As frações foram monitoradas via RMN 1H e ESI-EM/EM e foram analisadas somente aquelas cujos espectros apresentavam características de alcalóides do ácido antranílico e flavonóides não isolados anteriormente. Foram isolados do caule os alcalóides flindersina, skimmianina, 8-metoxiflindersina e dictamnina; das folhas os flavonóides 3',4',7,8-tetrametoxi-5,6- (2\",2\"-dimetilpirano)-flavona, 3',4',5,7,8-pentametoxiflavona, 5-hidroxi-3',4',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona, 3',4'-metilenodioxi-5,6,7-trimetoxiflavona e 5-hidroxi-3',4'-metilenodioxi-6,7-dimetoxiflavona,. Os alcalóides do ácido antranílico não foram encontrados em dez anos. Vários flavonóides isolados de N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, enxerto de Citrus sinensis (Rutaceae) e Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) foram testados frente a gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de Trypanosoma cruzi, visando verificar seus potenciais em inibir a atividade da enzima. Os flavonóides polimetoxilados e um isoflavonóide foram os mais ativos. Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated an investigation of N. paraensis searching for alkaloids. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR and ESI-MS/MS and only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. Stems afforded the alkaloids flindersine, skimmianine, 8-methoxyflindersine and dictamnine; leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethoxy-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone, 3',4',5,7,8- pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethoxyflavone, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. A number of flavonoids isolated from N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, Citrus sinensis graft (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma cruzi. Highly oxygenated flavones and isoflavone were the most actives. Keywords: Rutaceae, Leguminosae, Neoraputia, Murraya, Citrus, Lonchocarpus, Trypanosoma cruzi, alkaloid, flavonoids, chemosystematic Introduction Neoraputia species were originally described by Engler as species of Raputia Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus Neoraputia Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them from Raputia and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae.1 Previous investigations of Neoraputia reported the presence of eleven polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-flavones, one 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)- flavone and one flavanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich;2,3 five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'- hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6'-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-polymethoxylated chalcones from N. 381 Enzymatic Inhibition Studies of Selected Flavonoids Vol. 14, No. 3, 2003 magnifica var. magnifica (Engler) Emmerich;4,5 ten polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-flavones and one 6-(3”-hydroxy,3”-methyl- trans-but-1”-enyl)-flavone from N. paraensis.6,7 All phytochemical studies on Neoraputia genus have been undertaken in our laboratory and by Arruda et al.6,7, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. If Emmerich’proposal is correct, that Neoraputia is a Cusparieae member, then this genus can be regarded as a potential source of anthranilate alkaloids. Thus, it would be not surprising if anthranilate alkaloids had remained undiscovered in the Neoraputia because of their low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove Neoraputia to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated flavones.4,8 Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of Neoraputia species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. In order to establish this we have now undertaken a further investigation of N. paraensis. Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organisation). Control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side effects.9 The bloodstream form of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production.9 This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined.9 Glyceraldehyde- 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with significant differences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested.9 Highly oxygenated flavones from Neoraputia magnifica have shown to be the most actives as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor.5 These data stimulated an investigation of other flavonoids. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, flavonoids isolated from Neoraputia paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limon (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. Results and Discussion Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated an investigation of the extracts from stems and leaves of N. paraensis searching for alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on TLC plates. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations. The dichloromethane extract from stems afforded only the alkaloid flindersine (1).10 The HSQC and HMBC experiments on flindersine, permitted minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments.10 Table 1 shows that the signals for C-3 and C-10 to C-12 were reassigned. The observed correlations between the methine hydrogen signal at δ 6.77 and the 13C signals at δ 162.5, 157.3 and 79.1 led to their assignments as C-2, C-4, C-13, respectively. The upfield methine hydrogen signal at δ 5.56 showed correlation with the 13C signals at δ 105.8, 79.1 and 26.3 permitting the assignment of these signals to C-3, C-13 and C-14/15, respectively. The signals at δ 6.77 and 5.56 were then assigned to H-11 and H-12, respectively. The methanolic extract from stems afforded skimmianine,11 8-methoxyflindersine (2)12 and dictamnine.13,14 As no carbon shifts of 2 could be found in the literature, these data are listed in Table 1. Complete and unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for 2 were made using the HSQC and HMBC techniques and using 1 and haplophytin A (3)15 as a models. The methine hydrogen signal at δ 6.71 showed correlation with the 13C signals at δ 157.1 permitting the assignment of these signals to H-11 and C-4. Thus, in compound 1 and 2, H-11 is more deshielded than H-12. However, in model 3 the presence of the methoxyl at C-5 caused downfield shift of the usual range for 4,O-3-chromene quinolines, resulting in the H-12 being more deshielded than H-11. The methoxyl at C-5 also induces effects on C-10 and C-3, exhibiting upfield displacement for C-10 and downfield displacement for C-3. These data were also confirmed by HMBC experiments.15 The n-hexane extract of the leaves yielded 3',4',7,8- tetramethoxy-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone3 (4) which has not been recorded from N. paraensis. The dichloromethane extract from leaves gave four flavonoids, 382 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone16 (5), 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7- tetramethoxyflavone17 (6), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone5 (7) and 8, which are reported for the first time from N. paraensis, while the latter appears to be new. The flavone 8 exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3',4'-substitution (δ 7.33, d, J 1.8 Hz, H-2'; δ 6.93, d, J 8.2 Hz, H-5'; δ 7.46, dd, J 8.2 and 1.8 Hz, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for two methoxy groups (δ 3.97, s; 3.92, s), one methylenedioxy group (δ 6.08, s, 2H), one hydroxyl group at δ 12.73 (1H, s, OH-5) and two singlets at δ 6.54 (H-8) and 6.55 (H-3) indicating the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted and a flavone nucleus. The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)17 fragments in ESI-MS/MS of this flavone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B- rings. Thus, a combination of 1H NMR data and the fragment ions at m/z 146 (30%) and 181 (RDA-Me, 100%) fully supported the presence of 3',4'-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy or 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-OH-7,8- and 5-OH- 6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-OH-3,7,8- and 5-OH-3,6,7- trimethoxyflavonol indicated that C-6 methine (ca. δ 96) resonates at lowerfield than C-8 methine (ca. δ 91).18 Thus, Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts for alkaloids 1, 2 and model 3 1 a 2 a 3 a Atom δC δH m HMBC δC δH m HMBC δC δH m J 1H → 13C J 1H → 13C J 2 162.5 160.5 162.4 3 105.8 106.2 115.7 4 157.3 157.1 156.0 5 122.6 7.89 d 157.3 114.6 7.46 dd 110.3 155.0 (7.5) 137.2 (8.0, 1.0) 127.9 130.8 6 122.2 7.19 t 115.4 121.7 7.10 t 115.7 103.5 (7.5) (8.0) 145.5 7 130.8 7.48 t 137.2 110.3 6.94 dd 114.6 120.5 (7.5) 122.6 (8.0, 1.0) 127.9 8 115.9 7.33 d 122.2 145.5 117.4 (7.5) 115.4 9 137.2 127.9 132.9 10 115.4 115.7 106.5 11 117.2 6.77 d 79.1 117.3 6.71 d 79.1 126.2 5.54 d (9.9) 157.3 (9.9) 157.1 (9.9) 162.5 12 126.2 5.56 d 26.3 126.2 5.52 d 79.1 117.5 6.76 d (9.9) 79.1 (9.9) 106.2 (9.9) 105.8 13 79.1 79.1 79.0 14/15 26.3 1.54 s 28.1 1.52 s 28.0 N-H - 11.5 s - 8.87 s OMe - - 56.0 3.95 s 55.7 a (in CDCl3).

From these data 8 was characterised as 5-hydroxy-3',4'- methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy- flavone (9)18 and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxy- flavone (10).5 Preliminary work was firstly undertaken on specimens collected in Paragominas, state of Pará, north of Brazil, in February 1991.6,7 The present results obtained from specimens originating from Uruçuca, Bahia (February 1993), showed that there was no difference in the flavonoids between the two collections. However, alkaloids were obtained only from plants of northeast region (Bahia), which is characterized by drought summer, compared to rainy summer in the northern (Pará). In contrast, Neoraputia alba and N. magnifica collected in Espirito Santo, near northeast of Brazil, had only high concentration of flavonoids. Thus, geographic-variation do not seem to be an important environmental factor. The low concentration of anthranilate alkaloids is likely to be responsible for the alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. All alkaloids were obtained in very small amounts (1-3 mg), only flindersine (1) was present in substantial amounts (10 mg). In a previous paper concerning the chemical systematics of Cusparieae, which Neoraputia has been assigned,8 the importance of coumarins and anthranilate alkaloids was highlighted. This study brings into focus polyoxygenated flavonoids as another taxonomically useful chemical marker in this group. Many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds presents in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far. A number of flavonoids isolated from Neoraputia paraensis, N. magnifica,4,5 Murraya paniculata,19 Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limon20 (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus21 (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. The positive results are summarized at Table 3 and the occurrence of flavonoids evaluated at Table 4. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 65% when 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethoxy-5',6'-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)chalcone (11) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1, suggesting that chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The flavones 3',4',5',5,7- pentamethoxyflavone (12), 3',4',5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone (13), 4',5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (14) and flavonol 3’,4’,5’,3,5,6,7-heptamethoxyflavonol (15) completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 99-100%) at 100 µg mL-1. The activity does not appear to be affected by the introduction of the 3-OMe substituent into the flavone Table 3.

However, the activity of 3’,4’,5’,3,5,7,8- heptamethoxyflavonol (16) was comparable to that of 15 but, reducing the enzymatic activity by 88% at 100 µg mL-1. This finding shows that the activity varies with the position of methoxyl group. The higher activity of 12, 13, 14 and 15 could possibly be attributed to a greater symmetry of electron density of the molecules. Flavones 3',4'-methylenedioxy- 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (10) and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone (7) do not display significant GAPDH activity (26% and 36%, respectively) showing that 3',4'- methylenedioxy reduce drastically inhibitory activity. Differences between polyoxygenated flavones and isoflavone afrormosine (17) inhibitory activities are not significant, indicating that the presence of many methoxy groups in isoflavones are not a requirement for activity. However, isoflavone possess 3-phenylchromone skeleton and it may be incorrect to compare it with the other flavones tested. GAPDH activity was also inhibited by 96% when auronol derriobtusone A (18) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1. 385 Enzymatic Inhibition Studies of Selected Flavonoids Vol. 14, No. 3, 2003 Thus, clearly isoflavonoids and auronoids deserve more attention as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase- inhibitors. Highly oxygenated flavones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal GAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavonoids and the enzyme GAPDH.

Plant material Neoraputia paraensis was collected in Uruçuca, Bahia, Brazil, and a voucher (SPF 81-316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociências, USP, São Paulo. Isolation of compounds Ground stems (2700 g) and leaves (409 g) of Neoraputia paraensis were extracted with n-hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. Only the concentrated extracts containing alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on thin- layer chromatography plates, were worked. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations. The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from stem was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel. Elution with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1:0.2) afforded 16 fractions. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 1 (10 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The concentrated CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography over silanized silica elution with MeOH-H2O (1:1) afforded 10 fractions. Fraction 8 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient affording 2 fractions. Fraction 1 was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH (5:0.4:0.4) and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH (4.6: 0.6:0.4) affording skimmianine (3 mg). Fraction 2 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 Å pore diameter; eluant: CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1); flow rate: 4.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, λ 254 nm) to give 2 (second peak, 1.2 mg) and dictamnine (first peak, 1.0 mg), after four cycles of 80 min. The concentrated n-hexane extract of the leaves was four times flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc- MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc gradient, and finally with silica gel and Florisil (1:1) eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 (20 mg). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shodex Asahipack GS- 310P; eluant: MeOH; flow rate: 5.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, λ 240 nm) to give 8 (second peak, 2.7 mg), after three cycles of 60 min. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 also were purified by R-HPLC (as above; flow rate: 6.0 mL min-1) to give 5 (second peak, 5.0 mg), 6 (second peak, 4.0 mg) and 7 (second peak, 3.0 mg) after three cycles of 60 min, respectively. 5-Hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone (8).

Preparation and purification of recombinant T. cruzi GAPDH TcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as reported by Souza et al.9 It is maintained in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. T. cruzi GAPDH-activity TcGAPDH activity was determined according to a 386 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. modification of a previously reported procedure.23 Reduced NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 30s interval. The reaction medium was 50 mmol L-1 Tris- HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 β- mercapto-ethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD+, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 4-9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 µL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The specific activity (unit = U) of the enzyme was calculated as: (U mg-1) = {(∆ absorbance/∆ t) x volume of cell}/6.22 x volume of enzyme x [ enzyme] where ∆t = 0.5 min; volume of cell = 1.00 mL; εNADH = 6.22 (mmol L-1)-1 cm-1; volume of enzyme = 0.005 mL; [enzyme] concentration of enzyme in mg mL-1. T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity The inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 µL. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30s interval. Flavonoids were tested at 50 and 100 µg mL-1 in 10% DMSO using 5 µL of GAPDH at 0.90 mg mL-1. In each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO in the reaction medium and was used as the positive control. The specific activity of TcGAPDH was not significantly affected by the presence of 10% DMSO. Data were means of 3 repetitions and values as percent of control were used as follows: % inhibitory activity = {(U mg-1 control – U mg-1 compound)/U mg-1 control} x 100 Enzymatic inhibition studies have been carried out in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. Some of the potentially active substances, as flavones 6 and 8, can not be assayed with the standard procedure described here, due to problems of solubility in the reaction buffer and absorption of light close to the wavelength used to observe the reaction course (340 nm). To overcome these limitations an alternative technique is being developed, based on calorimetric measurements, similar to procedures adopted with other enzymes.24 Acknowledgements The authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvol- vimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES).

The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. These compounds were tested against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Compound 2 exhibited cytotoxicity for HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia) and SF-245 (human glioblastoma) cells. Pterogyne nitens Tul. (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae), popularly known as “ba´lsamo”, “yvira-ro´”, “cocal”, and “amendoinzeiro”, is a native tree common in South America. It is used as an ornamental due to its attractive ﬂowers and fruits.1,2 Medicinal uses of this species have not been reported frequently, although aqueous preparations from stem bark have been used by local Paraguayan populations in the therapy of ascariasis.3 Previous phytochemical studies with the leaves and fruits of P. nitens have demonstrated the presence of several guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity toward the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against CHO Aux B1 cells,4 and phenolic compounds with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical- scavenging activities.5-7 In our continuing search for new natural product-based anticancer agents from Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest plants, and their associated microorganisms,8,9 the ethanol extract of P. nitens was selected for further investigation due to its cytotoxic activity in the MTT assay. This extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning, yielding a bioactive n-butanol-soluble fraction with IC50 60 µg/mL against HL-60 (leukemia) cells. The n-butanol fraction was chromatographed using silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 followed by RP-18 to afford ﬁve guanidine alkaloids (1-5). Nitensidine D (1) was isolated as colorless oil and gave an alkaloid-positive test when sprayed with Dragendorff’s and Sak- aguchi’s reagents. Additionally, evidence for a guanidine alkaloidal type came from its molecular formula, which was established as C11H21N3 by HRESIMS. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) exhibited typical resonances for a terpenoid moiety, due to the presence of three vinyl methyl signals at δ 1.55, 1.61, and 1.63, two oleﬁnic protons at δ 5.07 and 5.17, and three methylenes at δ 1.97, 2.03, and 3.63. These data were consistent with the presence of a geranyl moiety. Additionally, a broad singlet at δ 8.85 was observed, integrating for four hydrogens, which was compatible with two amino groups of a guanidine structure. The geranyl moiety was conﬁrmed from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1), due to signals at δ 130.9 and 138.3 (two quaternary oleﬁnic carbons), δ 119.6 and 123.8 (two methine oleﬁnic carbons), δ 38.5, 38.9, and 25.9 (three methylene carbons), and δ 16.0, 17.5, and 25.4 (three methyls). The guanidine moiety was also evident from the signal at δ 157.6, characteristic of an imine functionality (Table 1). These observations and additional NMR experiments (DEPT 135, gHMQC, gCOSY, NOESY, and gHMBC) allowed us to establish a guanidine alkaloid structure for 1, with the same structural pattern for those alkaloids previously reported.4 The isolate 1 was fully characterized as shown, and its structure was in agreement with a tautomeric form (Figure 1). This proposal was supported by the 1H NMR data, in particular, due to the multiplicity observed for the signal displayed by the allyl hydrogen (H-1′) of the geranyl moiety. This signal appeared as a clear doublet at δ 3.63 (2H, J ) 6.0 Hz), which is compatible with a guanidine nucleus geranylated at N-1. The natural guanidines occurring in plants or animals show a variety of substitution patterns, with most of these including the 4 Dedicated to Dr. G. I.

However, the occurrence of the new guanidine-type alkaloid 1 can be explained by taking into account the imine tautomerism (Figure 1). Nitensidine E (2) was isolated as a colorless oil. The molecular formula was determined to be C11H19N3 by HRESIMS (m/z 194.2900 [M + H]+, calcd for C11H20N3, 194.2888), suggesting four degrees of unsaturation, with one additional unsaturation when compared with nitensidine D. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 (Table 1) indicated structural characteristics somewhat different from those of 1 and the other guanidines isolated previously from P. nitens.4 Considering that 2 possesses four unsaturations and showed positive Dragendorff’s and Sakaguchi’s tests, an alkaloid structure was deduced for this compound. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited the presence of a set of typical resonances at δ 5.52 (d, J ) 15.0 Hz), 5.81 (d, J ) 10.5 Hz), and 6.20 (dd, J ) 15.0, 10.5 Hz), characteristic of a sp2-conjugated system, which could be attributed to an E-diene unit based on the coupling constants shown for these hydrogens. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) showed resonances for three methine sp2 carbons at δ 135.4, 125.2, and 123.9 and for one quaternary sp2 carbon at δ 135.0. Additionally, both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed the presence of two vinyl methyl groups [δ 1.69 (18.0), 1.73 (25.5)] and a tertiary methyl group at δ 1.26 (27.6). These data revealed the presence of a C10 alkyl chain, which could be attributed to a monoterpene-type unit. The structural evidence from the spectroscopic data obtained allowed us to elucidate compound 2 with a guanidine alkaloid structure. Additionally, the mutually coupled methylenes [δ 1.61 (1H, m), 1.79 (1H, ddd, J ) 13.5, 4.0, 3.5 Hz), and 2.92 (1H, ddd, J ) 12.0, 14.0, 4 Hz), and δ 3.15 (1H, ddd, J ) 12.0, 4.0, 3.5 Hz)] would be compatible with a cyclic guanidine structure for 2. Indeed, this proposal was conﬁrmed from the gHMBC spectrum. The location of the methyl group C-10′ was assigned at C-3′ due to the observed gHMBC correlations between the methyl protons at H-10′ and C-2′, C-3′, and C-4′. Further, gHMBC cross-peaks between H-4′ and C-2′, C-10′, C-6′; H-1′ and C-2, C-3′; H-2′ and C-10′, C-4′; and H-6′ and C-8′, C-9′ completed the assignment of a cyclic guanidine-type alkaloid and its substit- uents. Also, a C10 alkyl chain composed of an E-diene unit was conﬁrmed through NOESY correlations observed for H-4′ and H-6′. The conformation adopted by this molecule was evaluated in a preliminary manner employing semiempirical calculations (Hamil- tonian as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G**), and a plausible conformation obtained for compound 2 with the methyl group at C-3′ in the -position is shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information. In Figure S2 (Supporting Information) we show a biogenetic proposal for the formation of the new guanidine derivatives 1 and 2. In addition to 1 and 2, three known compounds were isolated and identiﬁed as pterogynine10 (3), pterogynidine4 (4), and ga- legine11 (5). Compound 5 was ﬁrst isolated from Verbesina enceloiodes (Asteraceae) and later identiﬁed as a toxic and antidiabetic component from Galega ofﬁcinalis (Goat’s Rue).12 Galegine was a template for the design of metformin and other biguanide-type hypoglycemic drugs.13 The identiﬁcation of com- pounds 3-5 was based on 1H and 13C NMR and MS data analysis and by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory.4,10,11 Although a broad spectrum of biological activities has been described for guanidine alkaloids belonging to marine sources, few studies were reported from higher plants and of the potential anticancer activity of this class of natural products.14-16 All isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity, using a MTT assay, evidencing a key role of the prenyl substitution pattern in the level of activity. The cytotoxic activity of compounds 1-5 was evaluated in Vitro against HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma). Mean concentration inhibitory (IC50) values were determined using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol, with slight modiﬁcations, and the results are shown in Table 2. In human cells, nitensidine E (2) was the most active compound, showing activity for the different cell lines (Table 2). Therefore, guanidine alkaloids 2 may be useful as a prototype compound for the development of new antineoplastic drugs. Further work to evaluate the mechanism of action of the guanidine alkaloids characterized in this study is currently in progress. The structural features of nitensidines D (1) and E (2) appear less common than the guanidine alkaloids already reported from other higher plants. It is noteworthy that the majority of these alkaloids contain isoprenyl groups. Only one alkaloid having a similar geranyl side chain has been previously isolated from Fontainea pancheri (Euphorbiaceae).17 In some cases, the isopen- tenyl groups have undergone cyclization to produce hexahydroimi- dazo-pyrimidines, typical of Alchornea species (Euphorbiaceae).18,19 The structure of nitensidine E (2) constitutes the ﬁrst report of the Table 1. 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (125 MHz), and gHMBC Data for Compounds 1 and 2 in DMSO-d6 nitensidine D (1) nitensidine E (2) position δC, mult. δH J in Hz) gHMBC δC, mult. δH J in Hz) gHMBC 2 157.6, qC 1′ 154.1, qC 1′ 3 8.85, brs 7.98, brs 4 8.85, brs 7.68, brs 1′ 38.5, CH2 3.63, d (6.0) 2′ 35.1, CH2 2.92, ddd (12, 14, 4); 3.15, ddd (12, 4, 3.5) 2′ 119.6, CH 5.17, t (6.0) 1′, 4′, 10′ 31.9, CH2 1.61, m; 1.79, ddd (13.5, 4, 3.5) 4′, 10′ 3′ 138.3, qC 1′, 4′, 5′, 10′ 52.4, qC 1′, 4′, 5′, 10′ 4′ 38.9, CH2 1.97, m 5′, 10′ 135.4, CH 5.52, d (15.0) 2′, 10′ 5′ 25.9, CH2 2.03, m 4′ 125.2, CH 6.20, dd (15.0, 10.5) 6′ 123.8, CH 5.07, t (7.0) 4′, 5′, 8′, 9′ 123.9, CH 5.81, d (10.5) 4′, 8′, 9′ 7′ 130.9, qC 5′, 8′, 9′ 135.0, qC 5′, 8′, 9′ 8′ 17.5, CH3 1.55, s 6′, 9′ 18.0, CH3 1.69, s 6′, 9′ 9′ 25.4, CH3 1.63, s 8′, 9′ 25.5, CH3 1.73, s 6′, 8′ 10′ 16.0, CH3 1.61, s 2′, 4′ 27.6, CH3 1.26, s 2′, 4′ Figure 1.

To date, the isolation and characterization of prenylated guanidine alkaloids has been reported only within a limited number of plant genera.20-23 Furthermore, terpenoid-like alkaloids may have some taxonomic signiﬁcance for Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae, since their occurrence is most common among these taxa. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT 90°, and DEPT 135°) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using DMSO-d6 as an internal standard. Positive-ion high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an HRMS ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics). IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 FT- IR spectrometer using KBr disks. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). Column chromatography was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was per- formed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 °C, as well as by using Dragendorff’s and Sakaguchi’s reagents. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm × 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden. Plant Material. Pterogyne nitens leaves were collected at the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil). Extraction and Isolation. The shade-dried leaves (2.8 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with hexane (2.0 L × 5, at room temperature, for ﬁve weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macera- tion with ethanol (4.0 L × 5) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (<40 °C) to yield 12.7 g of a syrup. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH-H2O (4:1) (3.5 L) and partitioned successively with EtOAc (5.0 L × 3) and n-butanol (5.0 L × 3). After removal of the solvent 3.7 and 5.9 g of extract were afforded, respectively. The n-butanol residue was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sephadex LH-20 (2.5 g) in methanol to afford nine fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC visualized with Sakaguchi’s24 and Dragendorff’s reagents, to yield an alkaloidal fraction (587 mg). Separation of this fraction on reversed-phase silica gel column chromatography (RP-18) by elution with increasing amounts of MeCN in H2O afforded eight fractions (ALK-1-ALK- 8) and guanidine 5 (18 mg). Fraction ALK-3 (121 mg) was subjected to repeated column chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluted with CHCl3-MeOH mixtures (ranging from 0 to 35% MeOH), to furnish the isoprenylated alkaloids 3 (27 mg) and 4 (12 mg). Fraction ALK-7 (62 mg) was further puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (16:84:0.01), UV detection at 235 nm; ﬂow rate 13 mL/min], affording the new geranylated alkaloids 1 (22 mg) and 2 (11 mg). Nitensidine D (1): colorless oil; IR (KBr) νmax 1652, 1618, 1012, 845 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMS m/z 196.3052 [M + H]+ (calcd for C11H22N3, 196.3063). Nitensidine E (2): colorless oil; [R]25D +140.0 (c 0.01, MeOH); IR (KBr) νmax 1649, 1618, 1093, 839 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMS m/z 194.2900 [M + H]+ (calcd for C11H20N3, 194.2888). Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the guanidine alkaloids 1-5 was tested against four tumor cell lines: HL-60 (human leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 × 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 µL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 µg/mL) dissolved in DMSO (5%) were added to each well and incubated for three days. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 µg/mL) was used as positive control. Growth of tumor cells was quantiﬁed by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan product. At the end of 72 h incubation, the medium in each well was replaced by fresh medium (200 µL) containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product of MTT reduction was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (Spectra Count, Packard, Ontario, Canada). Drug effect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of control absorbance of reduced dye at 590 nm. The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Institutive Software for Science, San Diego).25 Acknowledgment.

According to their voltammetric behavior, the antioxidant activity of these phenolic acids was evaluated and the results pointed to the following sequence: caffeic acid (Ea ¼ þ0:31 V)>chlorogenic acid (+0.38 V)>sinapic acid (+0.45 V)>ferulic acid (+0.53 V)>p-coumaric acid (+0.73 V). The results were conﬁrmed by DPPH test, which evidenced the strongest antiradical activity for compounds possessing the cathecol moiety (caffeic and chlorogenic acids). Linear calibration graphs were obtained for their determination at concentrations from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1. The method was applied to orange juice. Selectivity was illustrated by the analysis of caffeic and chlorogenic acids electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode previously modiﬁed by electrochemical activation in the presence of ascorbic acid. r 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Dietary recommendations for healthy eating include the consumption of fruit juices (Williams, 1995) whose beneﬁcial health effects are mostly ascribed to natural antioxidants. Although the majority of the evidence emphasizes the roles of vitamin E, vitamin C and b-carotene, recent studies have highlighted the importance of the phenolic antioxidants in the total antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jfca.2003.09.013 Citrus phenolics represent a varied and widely studied class of compounds (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The phenolic substances of importance in orange can be classiﬁed into two groups: phenolic acids and related compounds and ﬂavonoids. The most important phenolic acid in orange juice is cinnamic acid and its derivatives: ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The relative contribution of phenolic derivatives to the antioxidant potential is associated with their effectiveness as hydrogen donors, which is dependent on the number and arrangement of the hydroxyl groups and the extent of structural conjugation, as well as the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring (Rice-Evans et al., 2000; Miller et al., 1993; Clegg and Morton, 1968). The antiradical ability of organic compounds may be assessed by measuring the ease of their reaction with the stable free radical diphenylpycrylhydrazyl (DPPH lmax 517 nm), leading to its reduced form (DPPH-H). Good free radical scavengers react fast leaving small amounts of unreduced DPPH, which indicates the presence of an effective antioxidant (Bonded et al., 1997). In addition to their antioxidant capacity, fruit phenolics have been the subject of increased interest in the last few years because their presence can contribute to the sensory quality of the fruit and juice through their effect on color, bitterness, astringency and ﬂavor. Therefore, different analytical methods are required for their quantiﬁcation (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Cordella et al., 2002). Phenolic substances have characteristic ultraviolet spectra, which have been used to detect adulteration in orange juice by spectrophotometric techniques (Escarpa and Gonz!alez, 2001; Frenzel and Krekler, 1995). These procedures have been replaced by chromatographic procedures, which provide more detailed information on samples containing several organic compounds (Escarpa and Gonz!alez, 2001; Bocchi et al., 1996). For example, analytical procedures for ferulic acid have been based on gas chromatography with ﬂame ionization or electron-capture detection following derivatization. HPLC methods for these phenolic compounds in orange juice have been used involving derivatization and/or solid-phase extraction coupled with UV, photodiode-array and ﬂuorescence detection (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Bocchi et al., 1996; Moskvin et al., 1999; Karovicov!a and Simko, 2000; Miller and Rice-Evans 1997; Christofersen and Cardwell, 1996). Alternatively, serial coulometric detection of phenolic compounds has been used to generate multivariate data for differentiation of juices (Peyrat- Maillard et al., 2000). The use of cyclic voltammetry as an instrumental tool for the evaluation of the total antioxidant capacity of the low-molecular-weight antioxidants (LMWAs) in both ﬂuids (Chevion et al., 2000) and edible plants (Chevion et al., 1999) is well known. A cyclic voltammogram provides information describing the integrated antioxidant capacity, which arises in large part from the ability of the compound to donate electrons around the potential of the anodic wave. Most of the LMWAs are reducing agents, which quench reactive oxygen species through electron donation (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1985). Therefore, evaluation of the overall reducing power by cyclic voltammetry reﬂects the antioxidant activity of pure compounds as well as that of mixture of compounds. Most of the studies involving LMWA reports ascorbic acid as a major component in the cyclic voltammetry response identiﬁed by measure of anodic peak around +0.4 V vs. Ag/ AgCl/Cl (Yu et al., 1996). Glassy carbon is the electrode material used extensively in electrochemistry for analysis of electroactive substances and as the basis for surface-modiﬁed electrodes. The electrochemical properties of this material can be improved by surface treatment (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 620 Electrochemical activation of the glassy carbon electrode through oxidation and reduction of the electrode surface is a widely used method to change its characteristics. Many authors (Zhang et al., 1996; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Golabi and Zare, 1999; Moreno et al., 2000) have demonstrated that this procedure can improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the electroanalytical method application. For instance, the electrode can present a good performance for catalysis and/or applications as electrochemical detectors for signiﬁcant types of analytes due to selective chemical or physical interaction between speciﬁc functional groups generated on its surface and selective species in solution. In spite of the high sensitivity and selectivity of electroanalytical methods and the great importance of phenolic acids in orange juice, few studies have been conducted on the application of this technique for their determination. So, the aim of the present work was to investigate the electrochemical behavior of cinnamic acid and its derivatives (Fig. 1) on glassy carbon electrode. In addition, the possibility of using electroactivated glassy carbon electrode for oxidation of ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was studied for their selective determination in orange juice without interference of ascorbic acid. In order to conﬁrm the effectiveness of these phenolic acids as free radical scavengers and to correlate this activity with the electrochemical behavior, a spectrophotometric test using DPPH as a substrate was also undertaken. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Apparatus and procedures The electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Metrohm Polarecord E 506 linked to a compatible microcomputer through a Microquimica interface.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 621 Metrohm stand 663 VA was used and a glassy carbon disc (0.02 cm2) from Metrohm was used as the working electrode. A carbon auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl/Cl (3.0 mol L1) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrode modiﬁcation was based on the following procedure described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999). The glassy carbon electrode surface was polished with 0.05 mm alumina suspension and rinsed with water. The electrode was immersed in 0.1 mol L1 sodium bicarbonate and submitted to continuous potential cycling from 1.3 to +1.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s1 for 5 min. The activated electrodes were rinsed and placed in a solution containing 1 103 mol L1 of the phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6. The deposition was carried out by dipping and by cycling the potential from 0.1 to +0.8 V at 50 mV s1 during a controlled time of 5 min. After both these processes, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with water and immersed in a solution containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The modiﬁed electrode exhibited a well-shaped cyclic voltammogram corresponding to the reversible oxidation of surface deposited only for caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid and stable current values were obtained only for the cycling method used for the deposition of diphenol compounds. Suprapur grade reagents supplied by Merck and demineralized water from a Milli-Q system (Milli-pore) were used in the preparation of all solutions. Acetate buffer used as a supporting electrolyte was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0.2 mol L1 acetic acid and sodium acetate solution. Ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic, chlorogenic and ascorbic acid stock solutions (1 102 mol L1) were prepared from the dry pure substances in water. An aliquot of the standard solution to be investigated was added by micropipette to 20 mL of deaerated acetate buffer pH 5.6, unless stated otherwise. Analyses of caffeic acid and chlorogenic compounds in orange juice were carried out using three representative samples of natural juice commercialized in Brazil as Danones, Jussys and Batavos. For comparison reasons, all samples examined were recently produced and stored at 10C in obscurity and analyzed shortly after opening. An aliquot of 600 mL of the orange juice (without any previous dilution or extraction) was transferred directly into the voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The previous activated electrode was immersed in this solution and seven uninterrupted voltammetric curves were recorded between +0.1 and +0.8 V at 50 mV s1 when stable curves were obtained. Finally, the cyclic voltammograms were carried out after a step where the electrode was rinsed and placed in a voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The mean values of peak currents were obtained and the acids composi- tion determined after standard addition method, when 1 103 mol L1 of caffeic acid solution was added to the original sample and submitted to the deposition step, after which the voltammograms were recorded as shown above. All measurements were analyzed in triplicates. 2.2. Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) The free radical scavenging capacity of ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was also estimated from its ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 106 to 1 104 mol L1 were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 622 phenolic acid to reduce the absorbance of DPPH solution at 517 nm, followed on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at a glassy carbon electrode Cinnamic acid and its derivatives, ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic, contain reducible oleﬁnic bond or oxidizible phenolic substituents on the aromatic ring that could provide the basis for their voltammetric determination. Nevertheless, only differential pulse voltammo- grams of 1 103 mol L1 of cinnamic acid exhibit one cathodic peak in the pH range 3–7 at very negative potential (1.5 V). The process is attributed to the reduction of the pre-protonated ethylene bond conjugated (H+[C6H5–CHQCH–COOH) after two-electron transfer, as veriﬁed previously by polarographic studies (Ferreira et al., 1996). The inductive effects from ortho and/or para hydroxyl groups to the double bond, which is conjugated with the aromatic ring in the derivatives ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, make the molecule more difﬁcult to reduce. Therefore, the cyclic voltammograms do not exhibit any voltammetric waves for reduction of phenolic derivatives on the useful potential range, and the methods do not demonstrate any analytical potentiality for their determination using the reduction of the oleﬁnic bond in these compounds. On the other hand, typical cyclic voltammograms obtained for all phenolic derivatives are shown in Fig. 2. Except cinnamic acid, which is not oxidized, all the derivatives present well- deﬁned waves, and the shape and the peak potentials are characteristic of each compound. The anodic oxidation of 1.0 103 mol L1 caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have shown only one anodic peak at Epa ¼ þ0:36 V and Epa ¼ þ0:38 V, respectively. Linear plots of peak current (ipa) as a function of n1=2 were obtained indicating that both oxidation processes are diffusion controlled (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). For both compounds, a cathodic peak is observed on the reverse scan. Epc–Epa values obtained from the cyclic voltammograms (n ¼ 20 mV s1) are around 30 mV suggesting a process involving two electrons (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The ratio of the anodic-to-cathodic peak heights (ipc=ipa) increases gradually from 0.8 to 1 with increasing potential sweep rate from 10 to 100 mV s1 and the calculated current functions (ipa n1=2) diminish gradually with the potential scan rate, showing the classical behavior of an oxidation process coupled with a slow subsequent chemical reaction. In order to establish their analytical potentiality, quantitative tests were developed for caffeic and chlorogenic acids using their anodic peaks by linear voltammetric scan. At pH 5.6, the analytical curves are linear from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1 and are described by the following regression lines: ip (mA)=0.08138+2.1472 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.9993, n ¼ 7) for caffeic acid and: ip (mA)=0.05321+1.9571 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.995, n ¼ 6 for chlorogenic acid. The reproducibility of the response was tested using a series of standard solutions of 5 104 mol L1 caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Relative standard deviations of 2.4% and 2.8% were obtained, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1.0 103 mol L1 sinapic, ferulic and coumaric acids in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have also shown one anodic peak at Epa ¼ þ0:45 V, Epa ¼ þ0:53 V and ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 623 Epa ¼ þ0:73 V, respectively. The inﬂuence of scan rate on the cyclic voltammetric parameters was investigated from 0.01 to 3 V s1. The anodic peak appears to correspond to an irreversible process, as no current is observed in the reverse scan. The peak current is proportional to n1=2; indicating that the process is diffusion controlled. The current function decreased markedly up to a highest scan rate. These results suggest that the oxidation step is followed by an electron transfer coupled with a rapid chemical reaction (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). A linear relationship between peak current and sinapic acid and ferulic acid concentrations was obtained from 4 104 to 1 103 mol L1 following the equation: ip (mA)=0.1302+ 0.602 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.9089, n ¼ 7 for sinapic acid and ip ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA E / mV 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 E / mV E / mV E / mV E (V) E / mV -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0 5 10 15 20 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Fig. 2.

A linear relationship was also obtained for coumaric acid from 4 105 to 1.2 103 mol L1: ip (mA)=0.05705+1.0663 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.995, n ¼ 7: In agreement with the literature (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Baizer and Lund, 1972), the voltammetric behavior appears to agree with the global mechanism proposed for oxidation of phenol group in aromatic compounds (Baizer and Lund, 1972). The hydroxy groups are oxidized via two electrons transfer leading to the generation of a correspondent quinone after liberation of 2H+. The results have indicated that the higher the number of hydroxy substituents on the aromatic ring, the lower the electrochemical potential. Thus, p-coumaric acids (monophenols) have a higher potential than caffeic and chlorogenic acids (diphenols). Such an order has already been deﬁned by Peyrat-Maillard et al. (2000). In spite of the number of phenolic hydroxyls, the oxidation potential of caffeic and chlorogenic acids also presented a reversible redox couple that was not seen for the oxidation of the other phenolic compounds. The voltammetric behavior indicates that the oxidation process can involve the formation of a stable quinone which is reduced in the reverse scan, as observed in the oxidation of other phenolic compounds with the hydroxy group at the ortho position (Baizer and Lund, 1972). In addition, the introduction of a quinic group on caffeic acid to give chlorogenic acid did not change the oxidation potential. However, the methoxylation of the phenolic groups (sinapic and ferulic acids) increases the peak potential and the rapid decomposition of the correspondent quinone makes the process appear to be an irreversible process since there is no reduction of quinone in the reverse scan. The antioxidant activity of standard phenolic compounds is usually measured according to the method of Cuvelier et al. (1992) based on the accelerated autooxidation of methyl linoleate in anhydrous dodecane using strong oxidizing conditions or by spectrophotometric test measuring the antiradical capacity via reduction of the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (Brand-Williams et al., 1995) or by cyclic voltammetry (Chevion et al., 2000), in addition to several other available methods (Punchard, 1996). In order to test the voltammetric results as a tool to evaluate the antioxidant capacity, the results were compared using the DPPH test (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each phenolic acid to reduce DPPH (see experimental section). Graphs of reduction of DDPH (%) as a function of different concentrations of phenolic compounds are shown in Fig. 3. The studied phenolic compounds showed free radical scavenging activity decreasing in the following sequence: caffeic acid>chlorogenic acid>sinapic acid>ferulic acid>coumaric acid. This behavior is attributed to the higher ability of diphenols to quench free radicals in solution by easier donation of hydrogen of hydroxy groups and to stabilize the respective radicalar forms due to electron delocalization. As expected, the antioxidant or antiradical activity of most phenolic acids is inversely proportional to their oxidation potential. Diphenols (caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid) show high radical scavenging activities and low oxidation potentials when compared with other acids. Monophenols (p-coumaric acid) are less active and respond at a higher potential which is however smaller than those substituted by methoxy groups (sinapic and ferulic acids). In fact, the potential value is dependent upon the redox behavior of the compounds, reﬂecting their ability to lose electrons. The comparison is similar to that veriﬁed with DPPH measurement. Moreover, the ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 625 signiﬁcant difference noticed for antioxidant activity for caffeic and chlorogenic acids is also conﬁrmed by the shape of the voltammograms which indicates oxidation processes with reversible electron transfer. So, the electrochemical oxidation could be used as a simple model to compare antioxidant activity based on the evaluation of the shape of the voltammogram and the oxidation potential. 3.2. Analysis of orange juice samples In order to investigate the analytical potential of the electrochemical oxidation in determining phenolic derivatives in orange juice, cyclic voltammograms were recorded after a direct transfer of 100–3000 mL of natural orange juice samples to the voltammetric cell containing 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammogram, obtained as described in the experimental section, is shown in Fig. 4. A well-deﬁned oxidation peak at +0.38 V with 3.08 mA of anodic peak current (blank correction) is observed after transference of 600 mL of orange juice Danones, with peak heights proportional to the orange juice addition. Cyclic voltammograms recorded after standard addition of phenolic derivatives from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1 promote an extra peak at more positive values following the sequence: sinapic (70 mV), ferulic (150 mV) and p-coumaric (360 mV) acids indicating that they are probably not contributing signiﬁcantly to the endogenous peak. Nevertheless, the standard addition of caffeic acid exhibited a concomitant increase in the peak current without any distortion of the peak potential. The same effect was observed with the standard addition of chlorogenic acid indicating that both contributions cannot be split. Interference of ascorbic acid was also tested under the same experimental conditions. Cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1 103 mol L1 of ascorbic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 presents ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 b c d a e fractional convertion of DPPH % Concentration µmol L-1 Fig. 3.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 626 an irreversible oxidation peak at +0.42V, which was identiﬁed as potentially interfering in the analysis of phenolic compounds in orange juice, too. Similar results were obtained when the described method was applied to the determination of phenolic acids in commercial orange juice assigned as Batavos and Jussys. The voltammograms obtained for 600mL of orange juice in 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6 present oxidation peaks similar to those previously detected, with peak currents of 2.8270.21 and 2.7570.17mA (values represent means of triplicate determinations), respectively. The peak height increases with standard addition of caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid or ascorbic acid, indicating value media of total phenolic compounds of 244.8737mg L1 (n ¼ 3). So, taking into consideration the fact that cyclic voltammetry could provide information about the total antioxidant capacity, without the speciﬁc determination of the contribution of each individual component, the method was tested using activated glassy carbon electrode. 3.3. Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at modiﬁed glassy carbon electrode As described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997), glassy carbon electrode activated previously in bicarbonate solution can have its surface modiﬁed by active groups, where quinones, imidazolic groups and enzymes could be electrodeposited. Therefore, the analytical potentiality of the activated glassy carbon electrode obtained as described in the experimental section was investigated to determine phenolic compounds based on its interaction with the modiﬁed electrode. The voltammetric response of glassy carbon electrode activated by continuous potential cycles from 1.3 to +1.6 V at a sweep of 50 mV s1 (50 cycles) in sodium bicarbonate (0.1 mol L1) solution does not exhibit any electroactive sites in the potential range from –0.4 to +1.0 V. Two different deposition methods of phenolic compounds were employed. These methods involved dipping and cycling of the potential during the electrodeposition process.

After carefully rinsing with water, the electrode was placed in a solution of 0.1 mol L1 acetate buffer previously purged with nitrogen. In the latter method, the activated electrode was rinsed and placed in a 1 103 mol L1 solution of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6, where it was submitted to seven potential cyclings between +0.1 and +0.8 V (at 50 mV s1). The electrode was then removed to a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for both methods using caffeic acid were recorded at 100 mV s1. A redox couple of peaks at +0.33/+0.30 V attributed to oxidation of phenol/quinone was observed for both methods, with characteristics close to those expected in a system involving surface process (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The voltammetric curves obtained using the cycling method present a higher peak intensity (Fig. 5). Successive scans (Curve n of Fig. 5) have shown constant values of current after the ﬁrst scan indicating that the remaining material is quite persistent on the electrode surface. The results obtained using the dipping method have shown repetitive voltammograms with continuous decay during the continuous scanning of potential indicating that the material is released due to weak bound to the surface. So, the results obtained for both processes indicate that caffeic acid can be deposited on the electrode surface due to a weak interaction with the phenolic group (dipping) or strong interaction with quinone groups generated after successive oxidation (cycling). The most effective method was the electrodeposition of caffeic acid onto glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution using cycling potential and it was chosen as the best condition for analysis of the phenolic compounds. The inﬂuence of cycling time from +0.1 to +0.8 V during accumulation of caffeic acid on the voltammetric response obtained for activated electrode was investigated immersing the previously ARTICLE IN PRESS 100 200 300 400 500 600 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 n 1 ip(µΑ) POTENTIAL (mV) Fig. 5.

After a controlled time, the load electrode was removed to the voltammetric cell containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The current increased linearly up to 5 min of exposition, showing that the analyte is easily and rapidly accumulated on the electrode surface. At higher time, the current reaches a plateau indicating saturation of the electrode surface. In order to assess the reproducibility of the electrode response, a series of 10 repetitive measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammograms (at 100 mV s1) recorded for the activated electrode immersed in 1 103 mol L1 caffeic acid solution and transported to a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The electrode response indicated a mean current peak value of 4.2470.12 mA, where the coefﬁcient of variation calculated was 4.3%. Under these experimental conditions, the calibration plots were tested immersing the coated electrode in caffeic acid solution containing 1 104– 1 103 mol L1 using a controlled time of cycling of 5 min. Linear relationship was observed between ipa vs. concentration from 1.0 104 to 7.5 104 mol L1 following the equation: ip (mA)=0.2796+7.813 103 (C=moles L1), r ¼ 0:9988; n ¼ 6: Constant values of peak current were always obtained above the concentration of 1 103 mol L1, as shown in Fig. 6, suggesting saturation of the electrode surface. The detection limit was calculated (LD=3 sd/slope) to be 1 105 mol L1. The cyclic voltammograms obtained using the procedure described previously have shown that chlorogenic acid can also be deposited on glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution. A pair of redox peaks is observed due to oxidation of chlorogenic acid loaded in the electrode surface with similar electrochemical behavior observed for caffeic acid. The oxidation processes of p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids on activated glassy carbon electrodes are quite different from the behavior described for caffeic and chlorogenic ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 2 4 6 8 10 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 Ip(µΑ) Concentration (x10-4 mol L-1) Fig. 6.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 629 acids. The cyclic voltammograms recorded after activated electrode transference to a voltammetric cell containing 1 103 mol L1 of these phenolic compounds exhibit the expected behavior of that veriﬁed at bare electrode. But, when the electrode is rinsed and placed in a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6 there is no voltammetric signal, indicating that there is no remaining material on the activated electrode surface. The electrodeposition mechanism of o-, p-quinones onto activated glassy carbon electrode has been described (Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997). The deposition of such compounds has been explained on the basis of a nucleophilic attack of quinones produced from the oxidation of phenolic compounds. When an activated glassy carbon electrode is used as a surface for electrooxidation of chlorogenic acid or caffeic acid, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the electrode act as nucleophiles against the o-quinone anodically formed. Such a process leads to bond formation and development of a stable modiﬁed electrode. The absence of o-hydroxyl substituents in the chemical structure or the irreversibility of the process observed during electrochemical oxidation, respectively, of p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids, probably hinders this interaction or enhances the release rate from the surface and reduces the utility of activated glassy carbon electrode to pre-concentrate these phenolic compounds. So, taking into consideration the selective interaction between activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic acid and/or chlorogenic compounds, without interference of ascorbic acid, the applicability of the method was tested in three different samples of orange juice. Quantiﬁcation of the caffeic acid content in orange juice was accomplished by multiple standard additions of caffeic acid on activated glassy carbon electrode as described in the experimental section. Five milliliters of the orange juice was directly diluted in the voltammetric cell by adding it to 15 mL of pH 5.6 acetate buffer. After 10 cycles between the potential of +0.1 and +0.8 V, the activated glassy carbon electrode was replaced in a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6 and characteristic cyclic voltammograms were obtained before and after the standard addition of caffeic acid. This method was also tested for aliquots of orange juice from 1.00 to 10.00 mL and the peak current increases up to a dilution limit of 50% in juice:buffer. The peak rise at +0.4 V obtained in all voltammograms also increases with the amount of chlorogenic acid added as standard solution addition but has not shown any interference of p-coumaric, sinapic, ferulic or ascorbic acid, indicating that the modiﬁed electrode has shown high selectivity to caffeic acid or chlorogenic acid determination. The results obtained using the proposed method based on standard addition of caffeic acid are shown in Curves A and B of Fig. 7. The results obtained from the repetitions indicate that 2.4270.28 mg L1 of caffeic/chlorogenic acids are present in the Batavo orange juice samples. Danones commercial orange juice presented 2.1570.56 mg L1 and Jussys, 1.8570.39 mg L1, respectively. The results obtained using the proposed method are in agreement with the values provided by the literature (Robards and Antolovich, 1995) which indicate that caffeic and chlorogenic acids are the major cinnamic acid derivatives in orange juice and their usual concentrations are around 0.1–2 mg L1 in commercial orange juices. 4. Conclusions From these studies, it was concluded that cyclic voltammetry is a rapid, simple and efﬁcient instrumental tool for evaluating the antioxidant capacity of phenolic derivatives: ferulic, p- ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R.

The selective interaction of activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic or chlorogenic acid offers a good method for the detection and determination of these phenolic antioxidants in complex matrices like orange juice with a high degree of sensitivity without any pre-extraction step or interference of ascorbic acid, p- coumaric, ferulic, sinapic or cinnamic acids since they are not deposited on modiﬁed electrode surface.

Introduction Styracaceae is a family constituted of small trees and shrubs, mostly native to tropical and subtropical regions (Pio Correa, 1931). The genus Styrax is dierent from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat in¯ammatory dis- eases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styr- acaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985; Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988; Anil, 1980; Segal et al., 1967, 1964; Ulubelen et al., 1978; Kawai and Sugimota, 1940; Kitagawa et al., 1974; Ulubelen, 1976; Nakano et al., 1967). From the leaves of Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (4) and the known nor-lig- nans 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methyl- enedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1), 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7- methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2), 5- [300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (3) and the lignan di- hydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (5), together with urso- lic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds 1±2 showed inhibitory proper- ties against the microorganisms, Candida albicans, Clado- sporium cladosporioides and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elu- cidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and 2). 2.

The bioactive extract was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with n-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc (4300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by puri®cation on preparative HPLC aorded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (4) and the known nor-lignans (1) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (2) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and (3) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (5) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identi®ed by chromato- graphic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The tri- terpenes and sterols were identi®ed by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13C NMR spectral data for 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylene- dioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) and 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7-methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13C NMR spectral data for 1 and 2 are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC corre- lations are presented in Fig. 1. Compound 2 was obtained earlier from the seeds of S. ocinalis (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent puri®cation of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of S. camporum (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucida- tion of compound (4) as well as the antimicrobial activ- ities of all lignoids isolated. Compound 4 was obtained as a white amorphous powder.

The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Tables 1 and 2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 4 with those described for 2 indi- cated that 4 is a glucoside derivative of compound 2. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 displayed four doublets at 6.77 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at 7.44 (1H, dd, J=1.9; 8.0 Hz) attri- butable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at 7.17 (1H, s) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, s), two triplets due to methylene protons at 2.75 (2H, t, J=7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, t, J=7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at 1.86 (2H, dt, J=7.8 Hz). This 1H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of com- pound 2. Further analysis of the 1H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet at 4.11 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and several signals at 4.33±3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound 4. The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 2) suggested the presence of a nor-lignan with similar ske- leton to 2. The main dierence observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 4 was due to the presence of the signals at 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH2) which con®rmed a glucosyl moiety. The 1H±±1H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. 1H±13C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. 1H±13C-three-bond (HMBC) correla- tions from the H-100 protons resonances at 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at 107.64 and 112.12 identi®ed the later as C-4. The 3J HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-30 and C-40 quaternary carbons with H-20 and H-60 proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-tri- substituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound 4. Other signi®cant correlations for con®rmation of 4 are depicted in Fig. 1. The extract and compounds isolated from S. ferrugi- neus were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively. Compounds 1±2 exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus C. sphaer- ospermum could be predictive for the activity against C. albicans. In conclusion, the activities of compounds 1±5 may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infec- tions in several Brazilian regions. 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin±Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for 1H and 50 MHz for 13C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90 and 135, respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70±230 and 230±400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H2SO4 after heating. 3.2. Plant material Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart.

Bioassay The crude extract and puri®ed lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium S. aureus ATCC 12228, the fungus C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast C. albicans ICB 12. Stock solu- tions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure com- pounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appro- priate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on pre- coated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as posi- tive and negative controls, respectively. For the anti- fungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened cham- ber at 27C. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with C. albicans and S. aureus were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of C. albicans and S. aureus in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30C for 24 h. 3.4. Extraction Dried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of Styrax ferrugi- neus Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2±CH3OH (2:1, v/v) at room tempera- ture. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH±H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. After removal of the sol- vent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respec- tively. The CHCl3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel ¯ash (77.9 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gra- dient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5- (300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)benzofuran (1), and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(300 -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40 -dimethoxy- phenyl)benzofuran (2). Fr. 40±41 (39.4 mg) was fractio- nated by micron silica gel ¯ash CC (Merck) using CH2Cl2±CH3OH (95:5) as eluent to aord 11 Frs. Frs. 5±9 gave a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52±55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica ¯ash CC (11.6 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using Hex±EtoAc±CH3OH (6:2:2) as eluent to aord 20 Frs. Frs 6±12 furnished dihydrodehydiconiferyl alcohol (5) (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gradient yielded 22 Frs. Fr. 20 (13.8 mg) gave a mixture of 3+4, which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-18 column) using a mixture of CH3OH± H2O (4:6) as eluent to aord compounds 3 (4.0 mg) and 4 (5.8 mg). 3.4.1. 5-(300-Hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) White amorphous powder; IR max (KBr) 3432, 2926, 1606, 1476, 1232, 1148, 1037, 931 cmÿ 1; ES-MS [M+Na]+ m/z 349, ES-MS [M+K]+ m/z 365.

Endophytes live in association with host plants during all or part of their life cycle without causing any apparent disease. They are considered outstanding and underexploited sources of novel bioactive compounds. Chaetomium globosum was isolated as an endophytic fungus from the healthy leaves of Viguiera robusta. C. globosum is a remarkable producer of chaetoglobosins, which are typically cytotoxic. In this work, chaetoglobosins B (1), D (2) and E (3) have been produced by the endophytic C. globosum strain. Chaetoglobosin B was evaluated against Jurkat (leukemia) and B16F10 (melanoma) tumoral cells and showed 89.55% and 57.10% of inhibition at 0.1 mg mL-1, respectively. Chaetoglobosin B also showed weak antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 120 µg/mL) and Escherichia coli (MIC 189 µg/mL). Keywords: chaetoglobosins; Chaetomium globosum; endophytic fungus. INTRODUÇÃO Os microrganismos endofíticos podem ser detectados em um momento particular associados aos tecidos aparentemente saudáveis de plantas hospedeiras.1 Dentre os microrganismos endofíticos os fungos são os mais comumente associados às plantas. Eles vivem nos espaços inter ou intracelulares dos tecidos das plantas durante todo ou parte de seu ciclo de vida, sem causar sintomas aparentes de doenças.2 Evidências sugerem que os fungos endofíticos possuem grande diversidade genética, implicando importância prática com relação à descoberta de novos metabólitos secundários bioativos.3 Muitos destes metabólitos possuem um grande potencial a ser utilizado na medicina, agricultura e indústria. Novos antibióticos, antimicóticos, imunossupressores e compostos anticâncer são esperados como metabólitos secundários produzidos por endofíticos.2 Os fungos endofíticos constituem uma importante e ainda pouco explorada fonte de novas substâncias químicas com poten cial biológico, portanto, devem ser considerados em programas de bioprospecção.2,4 Resultados relevantes das pesquisas sobre o metabolismo secun dário de fungos endofíticos incluem o isolamento do taxol, produ zido por Taxomyces andreanae, fungo endofítico associado a Taxus brevifolia.5 Desde então, uma variedade de fungos endofíticos tem sido reconhecida pela habilidade de produzir o taxol.6 A vincristina, outro agente antineoplásico, foi isolada de um fungo endofítico não identificado associado a Catharanthus roseus.7 Outros importantes agentes anticâncer incluem a camptotecina, obtida de Rhizopus oryzae, fungo endofítico associado a Nothapodytes foetida8 e a po dofilotoxina, produzida por Phialocephala fortinii, fungo endofítico de Podophyllum peltatum9 e também por Trametes hirusta, obtido de Podophyllum hexandrum.10 A seleção da planta hospedeira é crucial para isolamento de fun gos endofíticos e obtenção de novos compostos bioativos. A planta deve ser selecionada principalmente com base em seu próprio meio ambiente, histórico etnobotânico, endemismo, longevidade e áreas de maior biodiversidade.2 O objetivo deste trabalho foi o isolamento, a identificação e avaliação biológica das substâncias produzidas por Chaetomium globosum, fungo endofítico associado a Viguiera robusta (Astera ceae), espécie endêmica no cerrado brasileiro. O gênero Viguiera é representativo da família Asteraceae e característico na produção de lactonas sesquiterpênicas com atividade antinflamatória e diterpenos com atividade sobre músculo liso.11 Chaetomium globosum foi isolado como endofítico das folhas de V. robusta. Esta espécie caracteriza-se pela produção de citocalasanas, que apresentam diversas atividades biológicas, incluindo ação citotóxica.12-15 O cultivo de C. globosum levou ao isolamento das chaetoglobosinas B (1), D (2) e E (3). PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os experimentos de RMN 1D e 2D foram obtidos em espec trômetro Bruker DRX-400 operando em 400 MHz para o núcleo de 1H e 100 MHz para 13C, e em espectrômetro Bruker DRX-500 operando em 500 MHz para 1H e 125 MHz para o núcleo de 13C. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas ESI-EM Micromass Quattro LC, no modo electrospray. As análises cromatográficas por CLAE no modo analítico foram realizadas em equipamento Shimadzu SHIM-PAK com detector de arranjos de dio dos, utilizando coluna analítica CLC - ODS (M) (250 x 4,6 mm). No modo preparativo, as análises por CLAE foram realizadas no mesmo aparelho, utilizando coluna semi-preparativa VP 250/10 Nucleosil 100-5 C18 (250 x 10 mm). Nas separações em CLAE reciclante foi utilizado equipamento Shimadzu LC-GAV (UV-SPD-10AV) e coluna preparativa Shodex Asahipak GS-310 26 (500 x 15 mm). Nas sepa rações cromatográficas em coluna aberta foram utilizadas sílica gel (0,060-0,200 mm) (Merck®) e sílica gel 60 silanizada (0,063-0,200 mm) (Merck®) como fases estacionárias. Nas separações por coluna Chaetoglobosinas produzidas por Chaetomium globosum 1681 Vol. 31, No. 7 líquida a vácuo (CLV) foi utilizada sílica gel 60H (45 µm) (Merck®) como fase estacionária. Material vegetal Folhas da espécie vegetal V. robusta Gardn. (Asteraceae) foram coletadas em outubro de 2002 no canteiro de plantas do Laboratório de Farmacognosia da Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribei rão Preto – USP. Uma exsicata do material vegetal, identificado pelo Prof. Dr. J. N. Nakashima, encontra-se depositada no Herbário SPFR do Departamento de Biologia da Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras de Ribeirão Preto – USP, sob o código FBC105. Isolamento da cepa fúngica O fungo endofítico foi isolado de folhas saudáveis de V. robusta. As folhas foram lavadas em água corrente e esterilizadas por imersão em etanol 70% (3 min), NaClO 5% (5 min), novamente em etanol 70% (1 min), seguidas de lavagem em água destilada esterilizada (1 min). Após o processo de assepsia superficial, as folhas foram cortadas em pequenos pedaços de aproximadamente 0,5 cm de diâmetro, os quais foram incubados em placas de Petri com meio BDA (batata dextrose ágar), contendo o antibiótico terramicina (50 mg/mL) para evitar o crescimento de bactérias endofíticas. A espécie foi identificada através da seqüência de rDNA e é mantida em sílica gel (6–12 mesh) e slants de BDA a 4 °C no Laboratório de Enzimologia Industrial da Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto – USP. Identificação do microrganismo O fungo foi crescido em meio líquido YPD (1% de extrato de levedura, 2% de peptona, 2% de dextrose) em mesa agitadora shaker (72 h, 30 °C, 120 rpm), sendo então filtrado a vácuo, congelado em nitrogênio líquido e estocado a –70 °C. O DNA genômico foi isolado utilizando a técnica de extração fenol-clorofórmio e então diluído em 100 µL de água esterilizada e 1 µL da solução de DNA foi utilizada para o procedimento de amplificação. O DNA foi quantificado por espectrofotometria por leitura da absorbância entre 260-280 nm. A amplificação dos produtos foi verificada em gel de agarose a 1%. O par de primers ITS3 e ITS4 foi utilizado para amplificar a porção maior de rDNA 5.8S e a região ITS2 adjacente. A amplificação por PCR foi realizada com um volume de 50 µL. Um µL do DNA genô mico (500 ng), 2,5 µL de dNTP 4 mM, 0,5 µL de 5U de Amplitaq platinum Taq polimerase por µL e 5 µL de tampão 10X (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8,3], 2 µL de MgCl2 50 mM, 1 µL de primers universais ITS3 e ITS 4 [21 pM] e 37 µL de água destilada). A amplificação foi completada num termociclo sob as seguintes condições: 94 °C por 2 min, seguido por 35 ciclos de 94 °C por 1 min, 54 °C por 1 min, 72 °C por 1 min e uma etapa final de 72 °C por 10 min. Os produtos de PCR foram purificados em coluna Qiagen. A análise da seqüência inteira de DNA do produto de PCR obtido com os primers universais de fungo ITS3 e ITS4 específicos para genes de rDNA foi realizada para confirmar a identificação da espécie. Foi então realizado o se qüenciamento automático em ambas as direções usando um primer de amplificação inicial e a seqüência alinhada de DNA resultante foi analisada com o software Sequencher. A comparação da seqüência isolada foi realizada com a seqüência presente no GenBank, utilizando busca avançada de BLAST.16 Cultivo do microrganismo e obtenção dos extratos brutos C. globosum foi repicado em 13 placas de Petri contendo meio BDA e incubado por 7 dias a 30 oC. A cultura fermentativa foi reali zada em duas etapas. Inicialmente, 3 fragmentos de ágar de aproxi madamente 0,5 cm de diâmetro foram transferidos das placas de Petri para cada um dos 13 frascos de Erlenmeyers (1 L) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo pré-fermentativo seed,17 os quais foram mantidos em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 30 °C por 48 h. Posteriormente, a massa micelial obtida foi filtrada em ambiente asséptico e transferida para 13 frascos de Erlenmeyers (2 L) contendo 400 mL de meio de cultivo Czapek,18 os quais foram incubados em mesa agitadora por 144 h, a 120 rpm e 30 °C. Ambos os meios de cultivo foram previamente submetidos à esterilização em autoclave a 121 °C e 1 atm de pressão por 15 min. Após o término do cultivo, a cultura foi filtrada a vácuo em funil de Büchner e o fluido da cultura foi submetido à partição líquido-líquido com AcOEt. A evaporação do solvente forneceu 600,0 mg do extrato bruto acetoetílico (CGLA). Isolamento dos constituintes químicos O extrato bruto CGLA (600,0 mg) foi submetido a uma CLV, utilizando-se como fase estacionária sílica gel 60H e como fases móveis hexano 100%, hexano-AcOEt 19:1, 9:1, 17:3, 4:1, 7:3, 1:1, 3:7, 1:4, 1:9, 1:19 (v/v), AcOEt 100%, MeOH-AcOEt 1:1 (v/v) e MeOH 100% (150 mL cada fração), fornecendo 14 sub-frações. A sub-fração CGLA9 (250,0 mg) foi submetida a uma coluna aberta utilizando-se como fase estacionária sílica gel silanizada e como fase móvel acetona-água (1:1), fornecendo na sub-fração 5 a substância 1 (25,2 mg). A sub-fração CGLA10 (72,0 mg) foi também submetida à coluna aberta sob as mesmas condições, fornecendo 8 sub-frações. As subfrações CGLA10.4 (19,7 mg) e CGLA10.5 (19,0 mg) foram submetidas à CLAE reciclante em sistema isocrático MeOH 100%, fornecendo 5 e 10 sub-frações, respectivamente. Do fracionamento da sub-fração CGLA10.4 foi obtida a substância 2 (2,0 mg) e a partir da sub-fração CGLA10.5, novamente a substância 1 (2,0 mg). A sub-fração CGLA11 (79,0 mg) foi submetida à coluna aberta em sílica sinalizada, utilizando-se como fase móvel MeOH-água (1:1), fornecendo 4 sub-frações. A sub-fração 4 (54,1 mg) foi submetida à CLAE semi-preparativa, utilizando-se como fase estacionária C-18, fase móvel MeOH-H2O (1:1), vazão de 5 mL/min e λ de 225 nm, fornecendo 5 sub-frações, dentre elas a substância 3 (1,0 mg) e novamente as substâncias 1 (1,0 mg) e 2 (1,0 mg). Avaliação da atividade citotóxica A substância 1 foi submetida ao bioensaio de citotoxicidade frente às linhagens tumorais Jurkat (leucemia T) e B16F10 (melanoma). A amostra foi solubilizada em DMSO/meio RPMI (1:100) sendo este diluente utilizado como controle negativo. Como controle positivo foi utilizado o cloridrato de gencitabina. Para avaliar a atividade ci totóxica foi utilizado o método colorimétrico de citotoxicidade pelo 3-(4,5-dimetil tiazol 2-il) 2,5-difenil brometo de tetrazólio (MTT).19 A avaliação da atividade citotóxica foi determinada por espectrofo tometria, utilizando filtro de interferência de 540 nm. Determinação da concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) A concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) foi determinada pelo método de microdiluição em microplaca utilizando cloreto de trifeniltetrazólio como revelador. Foram preparadas soluções das substâncias isoladas contendo 1 mg/500 µL em DMSO. Em seguida, foram transferidos 100 µL desta solução para tubo contendo 100 µL de caldo triptona soja. Com o auxílio de uma alça de platina esterilizada, as culturas de 24 h dos microrganismos indicadores, desenvolvidas no ágar triptona soja, foram transferidas para tubos contendo 10 mL de solução salina esterilizada. Foram procedidas as diluições suces Momesso et al. 1682 Quim. Nova sivas das suspensões microbianas (Escherichia coli (ATCC25922) e Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923)) em solução salina e por fim em caldo triptona soja, de modo a fornecer um inóculo de 104 UFC/ mL. Em uma microplaca esterilizada de 96 orifícios foi aplicado um total de 100 µL da mistura do caldo triptona soja, da solução da substância 1 e das suspensões dos microrganismos. A substância 1 foi avaliada em concentrações que variaram de 400 a 1,563 µg/ mL. Foram realizados também os controles positivo, negativo e de esterilidade do meio de cultivo. As microplacas foram incubadas a 37 °C por 24 h. Posteriormente, foram adicionados em cada orifício 40 µL de cloreto de trifeniltetrazólio (Sigma®) preparado em solução aquosa (7 mg/mL). As microplacas foram reincubadas por 30 min, sendo então observado o aparecimento de cor. A ausência de cor nos orifícios foi interpretada como ausência de crescimento microbiano (microrganismo sensível à amostra testada). Foram utilizados antibi óticos padrão como controles positivos, penicilina G para S. aureus e estreptomicina para E. coli.20 RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico do extrato bruto AcOEt obtido do cultivo em Czapek produzido pelo fungo endofítico C. globosum resultou no isolamento de três citocalasanas (1-3). A identificação destas subs tâncias foi realizada com base nos dados espectroscópicos obtidos (RMN 1H e 13C, DEPT, gCOSY 1H-1H, gHMQC, gHMBC e EM) e comparação com dados disponíveis na literatura.13,23 As citocalasanas são micotoxinas que se caracterizam quimicamente pela presença de um anel peridroisoindol-1-ona altamente substituído e fundido a um anel macrocíclico (Figura 1). A natureza do substituinte em C-3 indica o aminoácido que originou a citocalasana, através da ligação com a cadeia policetídica precursora dos anéis peridroisoindol-1-ona e macrocíclico. Quando a citocalasana é biossintetizada a partir do trip tofano, a sub-classe de metabólitos é denominada chaetoglobosinas.21 Fenilalanina (originando citocalasinas) e leucina são aminoácidos que freqüentemente são também encontrados nas citocalasanas. As principais características estruturais do anel macrocíclico, em geral de 11 ou 13 membros, incluem presença de até três oxidações em C-19 (álcool ou cetona), C-20 (álcool ou cetona) e C-22 (ge ralmente cetona); presença de até três ligações duplas (∆13,14, ∆17,18, ∆21,22); presença de grupamentos metílicos em C-16 (Me-24) e C-18 (Me-25). No anel peridroisoindol-1-ona as principais modificações estruturais encontradas são presença de ligação dupla ∆5,6, ∆6,12 ou ∆6,7; presença de epóxido entre C-6 e C-7; presença de hidroxila em C-7; presença de grupamentos metílicos em C-5 (Me-11) e C-6 (Me-12). Mais de 30 chaetoglobosinas já foram isoladas e identificadas, e os dados de difração de raios-X permitiram o estabelecimento da estrutura cristalográfica das chaetoglobosinas.22 Portanto, apesar da complexidade estrutural destas substâncias, é relativamente simples identificar a classe química com base na análise dos dados de RMN 1H e 13C, e, através da comparação com os dados da literatura,13,23 estabelecer a estrutura da chaetoglobosina. A análise dos dados de RMN 1H, RMN 13C (32 sinais) e EM ([M+H]+ 529) possibilitou a proposição da fórmula molecular C32H36N2O5 para a substância 1 (IDH 16) (Figura 1). O espectro de RMN 1H apre sentou sinais característicos de chaetoglobosinas. Os sinais do anel indólico do triptofano foram observados em δ 8,25 (sl, NH); 7,51 (dl, J = 8,1 Hz, H-4’), 7,38 (dl, J = 8,1 Hz, H-7’), 7,16 (s, H-2’), 7,09 (ddd, J = 8,1; 7,8; 1,0 Hz, H-6’) e 7,01 (ddd, J = 8,1; 7,8; 1,0 Hz, H-5’). Os sinais de hidrogênios metílicos foram observados em δ 1,00 (d, J = 6,6 Hz, H-24), 1,33 (sl, H-11), 1,40 (sl, H-25) e 1,65 (sl, H-12). Os deslocamentos químicos e valores das constantes de acoplamento para os hidrogênios vinílicos em δ 7,65 (d, J = 16,4 Hz, H-22), 6,76 (d, J = 16,4 Hz, H-21), 6,18 (ddd, J = 15,4; 9,8; 1,5 Hz, H-13) e 5,18 (ddd, J = 15,4; 10,1; 3,5 Hz, H-14) indicaram a presença de duas ligações duplas com geometria E no anel macrocíclico, geralmente encontradas nas chaetoglobosinas entre C-21 e C-22 e entre C-13 e C-14. O sinal em δ 5,57 (dl, J = 8,8, H-17) evidenciou a presença de dupla ∆17,18, também comum nas chaetoglobosinas. Foram ainda observados dois sinais referentes a hidrogênios carbinólicos em δ 3,91 (dd, J = 10,6; 1,0 Hz, H-7) e 5,09 (s, H-19). O espectro de RMN 13C apresentou três sinais de carbonilas, uma referente à carbonila de amida do anel peridroisoindol-1-ona em δ 174,6 e outros dois refe rentes às carbonilas do anel macrocíclico em δ 201,0 (C-23) e 202,7 (C-20). As correlações observadas nos experimentos COSY, HMQC e HMBC permitiram a completa e inequívoca atribuição de todos os sinais de carbonos e hidrogênios da molécula. Os dados de RMN 1H e 13C da substância 1 estão de acordo com os dados publicados previamente para a chaetoglobosina B.13,14,23 As configurações relativas foram propostas com base na litera tura, a partir de dados da estrutura da chaetoglobosina A obtida por difração de raios-X.22 Os dados de RMN 1H, 13C, HMQC e HMBC para a substância 2 foram muito semelhantes aos observados para 1, que apresentou o mesmo íon molecular no EM ([M+H]+ 529). Porém, apenas três sinais referentes a grupamentos metílicos foram observados. O sinal em δ 1,65 (sl, H-12) observado para 1 está ausente no espectro de RMN 1H de 2, e dois sinais de hidrogênios vinílicos estão presentes em δ 5,30 (m, 1H) e 5,05 (m, 1H), ambos ligados ao carbono em δ 113,6, conforme correlação observada no HMQC. O sinal dos hidrogênios metílicos em δ 1,10 (d, J = 6,8 Hz) indica acoplamento com H-5 (δ 2,90, m). Estas alterações sugerem ligação dupla ∆6,12 em 2 (Figura 1). Os dados para os anéis macrocíclico e indólico foram os mesmos observados para 1. Os dados de RMN 1H e 13C obtidos para 2 estão de acordo com os dados publicados para a chaetoglobosina D.23 A substância 3 (Figura 1) também apresentou dados de RMN uni e bidimensionais compatíveis com os dados das chaetoglobosi nas. Os dados para os anéis peridroisoindol-1-ona e indólico foram compatíveis com aqueles previamente observados para a substância 1; as modificações foram observadas nos sinais referentes ao anel macrocíclico de 3. Os sinais referentes aos hidrogênios vinílicos H-21 e H-22, e respectivos carbonos, não foram observados, sugerindo redução da ligação dupla ∆21,22 em 3. Adicionalmente, a correlação observada no HMBC entre os hidrogênios metílicos H-25 (δ 1,82, d, J = 1,4 Hz) e o carbono carbonílico em δ 204,8 (C-19) sugere que em 3 a carbonila está em C-19 e o grupamento hidroxílico em C-20, originando a chaetoglobosina E. Os dados de RMN 1H obtidos para 3 estão em concordância com os dados publicados para a chaeto globosina E.14-23 Figura 1. Estrutura geral de uma chaetoglobosina com anel macrocíclico de 13 membros e das substâncias 1-3 produzidas por C. globosum Chaetoglobosinas produzidas por Chaetomium globosum 1683 Vol. 31, No. 7 Os dados de RMN 1H e 13C para as substâncias 1-3 estão apre sentados na Tabela 1. As chaetoglobosinas já foram isoladas das culturas de diversos fungos de solo, fitopatógenos, de ambiente hospitalar e de coleções comerciais, pertencentes aos gêneros Ca lonectria,24 Cylindrocladium,25 Discosia,25 Iplodia,26 Penicillium27 e Phomopsis.28 Porém, a maioria das chaetoglobosinas foi isolada de espécies de Chaetomium.29 Recentemente, as chaetoglobosinas C, F, E, e penocalasina A, além da nova chaetoglobosina U, foram também isoladas de uma cepa endofítica de C. globosum. Novas chaetoglobo sinas continuam a ser identificadas de fungos de solo29 e marinhos.30 Citocalasinas derivadas da fenilalanina foram recentemente isoladas de fungo endofítico no Brasil.31 As citocalasanas são reconhecidas por suas notáveis atividades biológicas. O nome citocalasana tem origem nas palavras gregas cytos (célula) e chalasis (relaxação) e refere-se aos efeitos celulares destas substâncias. As citocalasanas inibem o movimento e a quebra citoplas mática de células de mamíferos, efeitos atribuídos direta ou indireta mente à interação destas substâncias com a proteína actina.21,29 Há vários relatos12-15 da proeminente atividade citotóxica in vitro para as citocalasanas, o que foi experimentalmente confirmado pelo ensaio de citotoxicidade realizado com a substância 1 frente às linhagens de células tumorais Jurkat (leucemia T) e B16F10 (melanoma). A substância 1 apresentou inibições de 89,55% para a linhagem Jurkat e de 57,10% para B16F10 na concentração de 0,1 mg/mL, enquanto que nessa mesma concentração o cloridrato de gencitabina, utilizado como controle positivo, não apresentou inibição do crescimento celular. Na concentração de 0,5 mg/mL, os valores observados foram de 86,51 e 85,14% para as linhagens Jurkat e B16F10, respectivamente, enquanto que o controle positivo inibiu em 37,93 e 38,27% o crescimento celular. Já na concentração de 1,0 Tabela 1.

Nova mg/mL, enquanto o controle positivo inibiu em 41,45 e 38,87% o crescimento celular das linhagens Jurkat e B16F10, respectivamente, a substância 1 apresentou 85,30 e 81,01% de inibição. As Figuras 2 e 3 ilustram os resultados obtidos nos ensaios, que mostraram a elevada atividade citotóxica desta substância frente às células tumo rais. As chaetoglobosinas C, F, E, U, e penocalasina, isoladas de cepa endofítica de C. globosum, também apresentaram ação citotóxica na linhagem tumoral humana KB.32 Citocalasanas derivadas da fenila lanina, obtidas de fungos do gênero Phoma, também apresentaram atividade frente a células FT210 de carcinoma de rato33 e frente à linhagem tumoral humana HT29.34 A atividade antibiótica da substância 1 foi avaliada pelo método de microdiluição com a finalidade de determinar a concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) frente a S. aureus e E. coli. A substância 1 apresentou fraca atividade antibacteriana, com CIM de 120 µg/mL para S. aureus e CIM de 189 µg/mL para E. coli. A maioria das atividades biológicas descritas para as chaeto globosinas foi avaliada em modelos in vitro.12-15 Ensaios de toxi cidade experimental em modelos animais são menos numerosos, mas evidenciaram que a chaetoglobosina A apresentou toxicidade após admistração por via oral 8 vezes inferior quando comparada à admistração por via parenteral.21 As chaetoglobosinas A e C, juntamente com outras micotoxinas, agentes químicos e particulados, têm sido apontadas como respon sáveis pela diminuição da qualidade do ar em interiores, causando a “Síndrome dos Edifícios Doentes”.35 Ainda, as chaetoglobosinas A e C foram detectadas em produtos derivados de frutas27 e castanhas36 contaminados com espécies de fungos do gênero Penicillium. A elevada citotoxicidade dificulta a utilização das citocalasanas como candidatos a protótipos para o desenvolvimento de fármacos. Porém, estas substâncias são extremamente valiosas em experimentos de biologia química,37 principalmente por inibirem a divisão celular, originando células multinucleadas.13-15 CONCLUSÃO A obtenção de chaetoglobosinas reforça a hipótese de simbiose entre o fungo endofítico e a planta hospedeira, uma vez que estas substâncias bioativas poderiam auxiliar na adaptação do hospedeiro ao meio ambiente. Além disso, C. globosum parece ser um bom produtor de chaetoglobosinas, uma vez que linhagens de origem de solo, endo fíticas e de origem marinha, cultivadas em diferentes meios de cultura líquidos e sólidos, produziram substâncias desta classe. A linhagem endofítica descrita neste trabalho também produziu chaetoglobosinas quando cultivada em diferentes meios, incluindo meio sólido arroz e meio líquido de malte. Os resultados obtidos ilustram o potencial biotecnológico dos fungos endofíticos na busca por novos compostos bioativos e/ou ferramentas úteis em biologia química.

The phytochemical investigation of trypanocidal extracts from leaves and stems of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani (Rutaceae) afforded new pyranoflavones along with the known compounds flavone, 7-methoxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, haplotusine, 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone alkaloid, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosteryl benzoate. Their structures were established based on their spectral data. NMR data for the alkaloid haplotusine and the new pyranoflavones are described for the first time herein. These compounds were assayed on the tripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Among them, haplotusine and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone showed moderate values of IC50 136.9 and 144.9 µM, respectively. Keywords: Conchocarpus heterophyllus; trypanocidal activity; pyranoflavones. INTRODUÇÃO A doença de Chagas, causada pelo protozoário Trypanosoma cruzi, é uma das mais graves endemias do Brasil. No Continente Americano, ela afeta 16-18 milhões de indivíduos, sendo que 100 milhões estão sob risco de contaminação.1 Devido à ampla distribuição geográfica desta doença, à falta de tratamento eficaz e seguro, e às graves manifestações clínicas que ocasiona, a procura de novas substâncias para a profilaxia e/ou tratamento desta endemia se faz necessária. Neste contexto, as plantas são valiosas fontes de novos com- postos ativos e com baixa toxicidade.2 De fato, segundo um levan- tamento recente, 61% dos 877 novos fármacos desenvolvidos du- rante o período de 1981-2002 são produtos naturais, ou substân- cias desenvolvidas a partir deles.3 De plantas da família Rutaceae foram isolados alcalóides e lignanas com atividades tripanocidas.4,5 Além disso, as atividades sobre o T. cruzi ou sobre sua enzima GAPDH (gliceraldeído 3- fosfatodesidrogenase) de vários extratos e algumas substâncias iso- ladas desta mesma família foram determinadas.6-8 A espécie Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) pertence à família Rutaceae (ordem Rutales) e era anteriormente denominada de Angostura heterophylla (A. St.-Hil.) Alb.9 Nenhum estudo fitoquímico sobre o gênero é descrito na literatura. Entretanto, do gênero Angostura foram isolados alcalóides acridônicos.10 Os extratos e as frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus apresentaram atividade sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 Neste trabalho são descritos o isolamento, as atividades tripanocidas das substâncias obtidas de tais extratos/frações, assim como os dados de RMN do alcalóide haplotusina (1) e das piranoflavonas inéditas (2). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus, ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi, permitiu o isolamento de esteróides, flavonas e alcalóides 2- e 4- quinolônicos. A partir do extrato hexânico do caule de C. heterophyllus foram isolados os esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol;11 da fração diclorometânica proveniente do extrato hexânico das folhas, o benzoato de β-sitosterila12 e uma mistura de piranoflavonas inéditas (2); da fração acetato de etila deste mesmo extrato, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona13 e 5-hidroxiflavona;14 e da fra- ção acetato de etila do extrato metanólico do caule, flavona, 7- metoxiflavona, haplotusina (1)15 e o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4- quinolona (3).16 Todas as substâncias foram identificadas através da análise dos seus dados espectroscópicos e comparação com os da literatura. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) está sendo descrita pela primeira vez Figura 1.

Entretanto, os dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) não estavam descritos.15 No espectro de RMN 1H do alcalóide 1 foram observados quatro sinais relativos a hidrogênios aromáticos [8,00 (dl, J = 8,0 Hz), 7,73 (m), 7,68 (m) e 7,34 δ (ddd, J = 8,0, 6,4 e 1,6 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a presença de um anel aromático orto- dissubstituído na substância 1. Adicionalmente, um singleto em 6,08 δ, integrado para um hidrogênio, revelou a identidade dessa substân- cia como um alcalóide 4-R-2-quinolônico, que é de ocorrência bas- tante ampla em plantas da família Rutaceae.17 Entretanto, apesar do alcalóide 1 ser do tipo 4-R-2-quinolônico, apresenta a ligação N- OCH3, que é bastante incomum. A presença desse grupo foi deduzida a partir do sinal em 63,73 δ no espectro de RMN 13C. As atribuições dos dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) (Tabela 1) foram realizadas através da análise dos mapas de contorno de HSQC e HMBC. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) foi identificada através de EM e RMN, em uma e duas dimensões. Seu espectro de RMN 1H apre- sentou sinais relativos a oito hidrogênios aromáticos [8,23 (dd, J = 7,9 e 1,6 Hz), 7,84 (dd, J = 7,8 e 1,6 Hz), 7,69 (ddd, J = 8,4, 7,2 e 1,6 Hz), 7,55 (dl, J = 8,4 Hz), 7,42 (m), 7,40 (m), 7,07 (ddd, J = 7,8, 7,8 e 0,9 Hz) e 6,98 δ (dl, J = 8,2 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a existência de dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Este fato foi confirmado pela análise do espectro de COSY 1H-1H. O espectro de RMN 1H apresentou ainda um sinal em 5,69 δ (1H, dd, J = 9,5 e 3,4 Hz) e vários sinais na região mais blindada [1,85 e 1,70 (m), 1,25 e 0,88 δ (t)]. Observou-se também que os hidrogênios em 1,85 e 1,70 δ acoplavam entre si e com o hidrogê- nio em 5,69 δ (dd). O mapa de contorno de HSQC permitiu a deter- minação dos deslocamentos químicos dos carbonos (Tabela 2) li- gados aos hidrogênios descritos anteriormente. Os experimentos de RMN 13C indicaram, excetuando-se a região mais blindada, a existência de 8 CH aromáticos e 7 carbonos quaternários, o que sugeriu a natureza de 2 como um flavonóide, mais especificamente como uma flavona. Além disso, definiu-se que tal flavona deveria ser substituída em 3, já que não existia o sinal de H-3 (geralmente em 6,8 δ) e em 2', pois só existiam dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Por conseqüência, foi determinado que entre os anéis B e C da flavona havia ocorrido ciclização, com formação de um anel pirano. Este tipo de ciclização é observada em flavonóides prenilados.18 Entretanto, nunca foi descrita na literatura a ocorrência de ciclização de uma flavona para uma piranoflavona através de uma cadeia policetídica, como é o caso de 2. A presença do anel pirano foi confirmada através das correlações (2J e 3J) de H-11 (5,69 δ) com C-2 (155,95 δ) e C-3 (114,45 δ). Vale ressaltar, que os carbonos quaternários em 155,95; 155,69 e 154,71 δ, por serem coincidentes na projeção do mapa de contorno de HMBC, foram atribuídos (Tabela 2) por comparação com a 2'-metoxiflavona.13 O carbono carbonílico em 174,85 δ foi determinado como C-4 através de sua correlação (3J) com H-5 (8,23 δ). A espectrometria de massas com ionização por electrospray no modo positivo permitiu que fossem identificadas algumas das piranoflavonas presentes na mistura 2. Através desta técnica analí- tica, determinou-se o tamanho e as insaturações presentes na ca- deia alquílica das diferentes piranoflavonas que constituíam a mis- tura (Tabela 3). Entretanto, a posição da dupla ligação não pode ser determinada. Portanto, a mistura 2 é constituída por piranoflavonas inéditas que se distinguem no tamanho e nas insaturações da ca- deia alquílica (R). As substâncias isoladas foram testadas sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi nas concentrações de 500, 250 e 100 µg/ mL e os valores de IC50 foram calculados a partir dos valores de porcentagem de lise parasitária (% L.P.) obtidos nessas concentra- Tabela 3.

Os resultados (Tabela 4) mostram que dentre as substâncias testadas, as mais ativas foram os alcalóides 1 e 3, apresentando valo- res de IC50 de 136,9 e 144,9 µM, respectivamente. Entretanto, as substâncias testadas não mostraram ser potentes agentes tripanocidas, principalmente quando comparadas ao quimio-profilático violeta de genciana, cujo IC50 é de 83 µM, e com a lignana (-)-metilpluviatolídeo, que na concentração de 67,5 µM ocasionou 99% de lise parasitária.4 Apesar deste fato, os resultados dos testes tripanocidas sugeri- ram que as substâncias isoladas podem ser os princípios ativos das frações e extratos de C. heterophyllus, que foram ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Materiais e equipamentos Os espectros de RMN 1H, 13C e dos experimentos 2D foram obtidos em espectrômetros DRX-200 e ARX-400 da Bruker. Fo- ram utilizados CDCl3 ou CD3OD como solventes e tetrametilsilano (TMS) como padrão interno. O espectro de massas foi obtido por injeção direta em um equi- pamento Micromass Quattro LC, utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações A obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus estão descritos em Ambrozin et al.6 Isolamento das substâncias A mistura dos esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol foi obtida do extrato AHCH. Este extrato foi inicialmente submetido à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 4,7 x 23,9 cm), utilizan- do-se sílica gel (230-400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH], originando 8 frações. Da quarta fração (AHCH4; 521,3 mg) foi obtida a mistura de esteróides (120,6 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 3,8 x 29,3 cm) de sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH]. A fração AHFHD (2,0 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 4,1 x 44,8 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hex:CH2Cl2→MeOH], originando 7 frações. A quarta fração (AHFHD4; 309,1 mg) foi cromatografada em sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,0 x 47,0 cm) e eluída com MeOH, dando origem a 5 frações. A quinta fração (AHFHD4,5; 5,9 mg) foi identificada como o benzoato de β-sitosterila. A fração AHFHD5 (375,6 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna e à cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa. Tais técnicas per- mitiram a obtenção de 2,8 mg da mistura de piranoflavonas 2. Da fração AHFHA foram obtidas a flavona e a 7-metoxiflavona, segundo procedimento descrito em Ambrozin et al.6 Desta fração também foi isolada a 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHFHA (7,5 g) foi inicialmente submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 8,0 x 5,9 cm), utilizando-se florisil como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (hexano→MeOH), obtendo-se 6 frações. A fra- ção 3 (AHFHA3; 1,6 g) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel (230-400 mesh) (φ x h = 3,9 x 25,2 cm), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (9:1) → MeOH), dando origem a seis frações. A sexta fração (AHFHA3,6; 31,4 mg) foi recromatografada em coluna de sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,2 x 49,2 cm) e eluída com MeOH, originando 6 frações, das quais a sexta (AHFHA3,6,5; 5,2 mg) foi identificada como 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHCMA (2,4 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 3,2 x 53,0 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (CH2Cl2:MeOH (9,5:0,5) → MeOH), para dar origem a 4 frações. A primeira fração (AHCMA1; 872,0 mg) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (7:3) → MeOH), obtendo-se 8 frações. Da quarta fra- ção (AHCMA1,4; 15,5 mg) foi isolada a haplotusina (1) (5,3 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição isocrática (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Da oitava fração (AHCMA1,8; 129,2 mg) foi isolado o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4-quinolona (3) (22,1 mg), por cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Ensaio tripanocida Os ensaios com as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi foram realizados no Departamento de Análises Clínicas, Bromatológicas e Toxicológicas da FCFRP-USP, segundo procedimento descrito em Vieira et al.7 Para os ensaios foram utilizadas cepas “Y” de T. cruzi, que são mantidas através de passagens seriadas em camundongos, por meio de repiques semanais, no Laboratório de Parasitologia do Departa- mento de Ciências da Saúde da FCFRP-USP. Os ensaios biológicos das substâncias foram realizados utili- zando-se sangue de camundongos albinos Swiss, infectados pela cepa “Y” do T. cruzi, o qual foi obtido por punção cardíaca no pico da parasitemia (sétimo dia). Esse sangue foi diluído em sangue de animal sadio, de forma a se obter uma concentração final de 2x106 formas tripomastigotas por mL de sangue. Os ensaios foram reali- zados em microplacas de titulação (96 poços), onde o sangue infectado e as misturas (ou substâncias) a serem avaliadas foram solubilizados (em triplicata), e o material foi incubado por 24 h a 4 oC. Após este tempo, a contagem das formas tripomastigotas foi Tabela 4. Atividade tripanocida das substâncias isoladas de C. heterophyllus substância Concentração %L.P.

A chemical study on the EtOAc extract produced by Xylaria sp., an endophytic fungus from Piper aduncum, resulted in the isolation of a new cytochalasin 1, along with five known 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5), and R (6). The 1-6 were evaluated against the fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum and only 5 showed weak activity. The cytotoxicity in vitro against HeLA and CHO cells lines were investigated and the cytochalasins 2-4, and 6 showed a strong activity against HeLA. The DNAdamaging activity of 1-6 were also investigated against mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. Keywords: Xylaria sp.; Piper aduncum; endophytic fungus. INTRODUÇÃO Aproximadamente um quarto de todos os produtos naturais biologicamente ativos conhecidos têm sido produzidos por fun gos.1 Estes são estimados em 1,5 milhões de espécies2 distribuídos principalmente entre fungos micoparasitas, coprófilos, de solo, de água doce, epifíticos e endofíticos. Fungos endofíticos são micro- organismos que habitam o interior de um vegetal,3 em pelo menos por um período de seu ciclo de vida. Apesar de serem produtores de metabólitos secundários biologicamente ativos,4 são pouco explorados. Dando continuidade aos estudos de prospecção química e bioló gica em fungos endofíticos isolados de espécies vegetais do cerrado, a espécie vegetal Piper aduncum foi selecionada, pois a medicina popular relata propriedades diurética, cicatrizante e anti-hemorrá gica.5-7 Dados fitoquímicos de P. aduncum relatam a ocorrência de amidas, fenilpropanoides, di-hidrochalconas e derivados prenilados com atividades moluscida, bactericida e citotóxica.8,9 Estes fatos, associados às observações de que micro-organismos endofíticos podem mimetizar a química de seus respectivos hospedeiros e produzirem substâncias ou derivados com maior bioatividade,10 direcionaram o estudo químico/biológico dos fungos endofíticos associados à P. aduncum. P. aduncum foi submetida ao isolamento e à purificação dos endófitos e conduziu a seis linhagens puras. Após triagem quími ca/biológica, a linhagem PA-01 foi classificada como Xylaria sp. e selecionada para estudo, mediante atividade seletiva do extrato bruto AcOEt contra a linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevi siae RS 321 e contra os fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. O fungo Xylaria sp. foi cultivado no meio de cultura PDB, em escala ampliada, para obtenção do extrato bruto que, após fracio namento cromatográfico por CLAE, levou ao isolamento de uma citocalasina inédita (1) e das 19,20-epoxicitocalasina conhecidas D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5) e (6). A estrutura das substâncias isoladas foi determinada com base nas análises dos dados espectrométricos de IV, EM-ES, RMN de 1H e 13C (1D e 2 D). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A fórmula molecular da citocalasina 1 foi estabelecida como C30H37NO7 por ESI-EMAR (m/z 524,2729 [M + H]+) e com auxílio dos espectros de RMN de 13C e DEPT. O espectro no IV mostrou as absorções de hidroxila (3440 cm-1) e uma absorção larga (1710 cm-1) atribuída a estiramentos C=O. A análise dos dados de RMN de 1H, 13C e DEPT indicou a presença de quatro átomos de carbono carbonílico (sendo dois de grupos cetona), um anel benzênico mo nossubstituído, cinco metilas, onze átomos de carbono de grupos metínicos (dois olefínicos e três carbinólicos), dois metilênicos e dois átomos de carbono quaternário, sendo um carbinólico. O índice de deficiência de hidrogênio calculado foi igual a 13. Estes dados são característicos de substâncias da classe das citocalasinas. A atribuição de todos os átomos de hidrogênio aos respectivos átomos de carbonos foi realizada com auxílio dos mapas de contorno do experimento gHMQC. A análise dos espectros de gCOSY e TOCSY indicou os átomos de hidrogênios acoplados em série e permitiu identificar os quatro sistemas de spins da molécula H-2’ a H-6’; H-10 a H-12; H-8 a H-22 e H-19 a H-21. A estereoquímica da ligação dupla entre C-13 e C-14, assim como o epóxido em C-19 e C-20 foi definida como trans pelas constantes de acoplamento (J = 15,5 e 2,0 Hz, respectivamente).11 A correlação gHM BC de H-10a (dH 2,68) com C-1´ (dC 137,5) confirmou a presença do grupo fenil em C-10. As correlações de H-12 (dH 1,01) e H-8 (dH 3,42) Citocalasinas produzidas por Xylaria sp. 2039 Vol. 33, No. 10 com C-7 (dC 212,6) e comparação com dados de citocalasa-13(E),19(E)- dieno-1,7,17-triona,12 possibilitaram a elucidação do núcleo isoindolona. As correlações de H-22 (dH 1,12) e H-23 (dH 1,44) com C-17 (δC 214,9) e entre H-21 (dH 5,43) e C-8 (dC 51,2) e comparação com 19,20-epoxi citocalasina C (3)13 permitiram elucidar o anel macrocíclico. As configurações relativas do núcleo isoindolona e do anel macrocíclico de 1 foram estabelecidas pelo experimento NOESY, onde se observou correlação entre H-4 e H-21, valores dos desloca mentos químicos de RMN de 1H e 13C, constantes de acoplamento e comparação com 18,21-di-hidroxi-16,18-dimetil-10-fenil-citocalasa- 13(E),19(E)-dieno-1,7,17-triona12 e com 19,20-epoxicitocalasina C (3),13 respectivamente, Figura 1. Estas informações permitiram estabelecer a configuração relativa da inédita citocalasina 1. As substâncias 2-6 foram identificadas pela análise por EM, RMN de 1H e 13C, gHMQC, gHMBC, gCOSY e NOESY e por comparação com dados descritos na literatura.13 As citocalasinas 1-6 (Figura 1) foram avaliadas quanto à atividade antifúngica, frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium clados porioides e C. sphaerospermum, usando-se o método da autobiografia direta.14 A substância 5 mostrou uma fraca atividade na concentração de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrão nistatina (1mg mL- 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentaram-se inativas. As substâncias 1-6 foram ensaiadas frente à linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevisiae RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica não serem as responsáveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15 A avaliação da atividade citotóxica de 1-6 foi realizada em células de mamíferos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cérvix humano) e CHO (ovário de hamster chinês).16 Para a linhagem não cancerígena CHO, as substâncias 2, 3, 5 e 6 apresentaram IC50 de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As citocalasinas 1 e 4 não apresen taram IC50 nas concentrações testadas, sendo que 1 foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1. Na linhagem cancerígena HeLa as substâncias 1-6 apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 5,0 mmol L-1. A forte atividade apresentada pelas citocalasinas 2-5 contra a linhagem cancerígena HeLa e a fraca contra a linhagem não cance rígena CHO evidenciam uma seletividade destas substâncias para as linhagens tumorais HeLa. Para o nosso conhecimento, este é o primeiro relato de citocalasinas sendo produzidas por fungos endofíticos associados à Piper aduncum. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentação Os espectros de absorção na região do IV foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa resolução da marca Fisons, modelo VG Pla tfform II, no modo de ionização electrospray (ESI). Os espectros Figura 1. Estruturas das substâncias isoladas de Xylaria sp. Silva et al. 2040 Quim. Nova de massas de alta resolução foram obtidos em espectrômetro QTOF (Micromass), utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em CDCl3 e DMSO-d6, no espectrômetro Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrão de referência. O aparelho de cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE) foi um Varian Pro Star, com detectores UV-Vis. As colunas analíticas e preparativas utilizadas foram Phenomenex tipo Luna - C18 (250 x 4,60 mm, 5 mm) e (250 x 21,20 mm, 10 mm), respectivamente. Os meios de cultura líquido e sólido foram submetidos à esterili zação em autoclave a 121 °C e 1 atm de pressão por 20 min. Material vegetal Folhas saudáveis de Piper aduncum foram coletadas na Casa de Vegetação do Instituto de Química - UNESP- Araraquara em maio de 2001. Isolamento dos fungos endofíticos As folhas coletadas foram lavadas com água e sabão, a seguir esterilizadas por imersão em NaClO (1%) por 5 min, seguido de etanol 70% por 1 min e lavadas com água esterilizada 2 vezes por 10 min.17-22 As folhas esterilizadas foram assepticamente seccionadas em segmentos de 1 cm2 aproximadamente e colocados em placa de Petri, contendo o meio de cultura batata dextrose ágar (PDA), marca Difco, preparado na concentração de 39 g/L, acrescido do antibiótico sulfato de gentamicina e incubado a 25 oC. O crescimento dos fungos foi monitorado diariamente e, após cada cultura atingir de 1-2 cm em diâmetro, foram submetidos a sucessivas repicagens até obtenção das linhagens puras. Foram obtidas seis linhagens puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Química Orgânica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como Xylaria sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Coleção Micológica de Lavras, Universi dade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292. Cultivo em meio líquido e obtenção dos extratos brutos O fungo endofítico Xylaria sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 dias. A seguir foi inoculado em 20 frascos de Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentração de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantidos em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 °C por 28 dias. Após este período o caldo foi separado do micélio por filtração, extraído com AcOEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extraído com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fração CHCl3 (0,7 g). Isolamento das citocalasinas A fração CHCl3 (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de sílica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco frações: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1). Estas foram analisadas por CLAE-DAD (Si C-18, gradiente H2O:CH3CN 5 a 100% de CH3CN, 40 min, fluxo de 1 mL/min), sendo detectada uma alta concentração de citocalasinas na fração PA-01-3. A fração PA-01-3 foi submetida à CLAE-prep em fase reversa [l = 220 nm, 10 mL/min CH3CN:H2O (68:32)], resultando nas cito calasinas 1 (5,5 mg, tR = 71 min), 2 (17,5 mg, tR = 32 min), 3 (30,0 mg, tR = 54 min), 4 (15,0 mg, tR = 26 min), 5 (15,5 mg, tR = 74 min), e 6 (12,5 mg, tR = 43 min). Bioensaios Teste de bioautografia com fungos Para avaliação da atividade antifúngica do extrato bruto AcOEt e das substâncias 1-6 frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioi des e C. sphaerospermum, utilizou-se a metodologia descrita anterior mente na literatura.14 Os ensaios foram realizados nas concentrações de 5, 10, 20, 50 e 100 µg mL-1, usando nistatina como controle positivo. Teste para avaliação preliminar da atividade citotóxica Para a avaliação da atividade citotóxica do extrato bruto AcOEt e das substâncias 1-6, foram utilizadas três linhagens mutantes de Sac charomyces cerevisiae (rad+, 52Y e RS 321), segundo metodologia descrita na literatura.15 Os extratos foram testados na concentração de 2 mg mL-1 e as substâncias puras com 0,5 mg mL-1, como padrões foram utilizados: camptotecina: rad+ 200 µg mL-1 (16,0 mm; 16,0 mm) e 52Y (5 µg mL-1; 21,0 mm) e estreptonigrina: RS-321 (4 µg mL-1 20,0 mm).

The ethyl acetate extract from culture of this fungus aﬀorded two benzopyran derivatives: (20S)-2-(propan-20-ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one (2) and 2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-benzopyran-4,5-diol (4); and two known benzopyrans: 2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (1) and (2R)-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzopyran-4-one (3). The structures of 2 and 4 were established on the basis of comprehen- sive spectroscopic analysis, mainly using 1D and 2D NMR experiments. The benzopyrans 1 and 2 showed weak in vitro antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides. Analyses of the biological activities were also carried out on HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, aiming to evaluate their potential eﬀects on mammalian cell line proliferation. Results from both cell lines indicated that compound 2 was able to induce cell proliferation: 70% on HeLa cells and 25% on CHO cells. 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The genus Ocotea is well known as a source of shi- kimate-derived aromatics such as benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, neolignans and pyrones (Franca et al., 1975; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989; Mandarino, 1985). Members of this genus are also widely used by Brazilian natives due to its purported pharmacological properties and resistance of the wood to fungal attacks (Chavez et al., 1995). As part of our studies on bioactive agents from metabolites produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado, we initially selected 16 species of plants, which had already been phytochemically proﬁled by our group. 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The extract of a Curvularia sp. isolated from Ocotea corymbosa (Meissn.) Mez. showed moderate antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides, triggering further studies. The crude EtOAc extract aﬀorded two new benzopyran derivatives (2 and 4) and the known compounds 1 and 3, which were tested in cell proliferation and antifungal assays. Compound 2 caused a potent proliferative stimulus to two mammalian cell lines and a weak antifungal activ- ity. The dualistic activities described in this study (stim- ulatory mammalian cell proliferation and antifungal) might be of special interest in what concerns to species speciﬁcity action. 2. Results and discussion The known compounds 2-methyl-5-methoxy-benzo- pyran-4-one (1) and (2R)-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-5-meth- oxy-benzopyran-4-one (3), were identiﬁed by comparing their physical and spectroscopic data with lit- erature values (Nagasawa et al., 1988; Wu et al., 1999). A positive optical rotation displayed by compound 3, further allowed the assignment of the absolute conﬁgu- ration at C-2 as R. Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecu- lar formula C12H13O4 ([M + H]+ at m/z 221.0917). Anal- ysis of the NMR, IR and UV spectra, suggested the presence of a chromane derivative (Saengchantara and Wallace, 1990). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 1) showed a signal at d 12.70 (1H, s) attributed to a che- lated phenolic OH. Spin-systems corresponding to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring and a 2-hydroxypropyl group were also observed, along with an isolated oleﬁn proton signal. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 sig- nals (Table 1) consistent with these units and with the presence of a carbonyl group. The 13C NMR chemical shifts indicated that the benzene ring is 1,3-dioxygenated and that the carbonyl group is part of a benzopyran unit. Data from the gHMBC experiment (Table 1) sup- ported these conclusions and enabled completion of structure 2. For example, correlations of the H-1a0 pro- ton with oleﬁnic carbons C-2 and C-3 enabled location at the 2-hydroxypropyl group at C-2. In addition, the selected irradiation 1D-NOESY experiment was con- ducted on H-3 and showed NOE correlations with H- 1a0 and H-20. The absolute conﬁguration of analogue (20S)-7-hydroxy-2-(20-hydropropyl)-5-methyl-chromone has been determined as S (Kashiwada et al., 1984) and showed a positive optical rotation. Since 2 also exhibited positive speciﬁc rotation, C-20 was assigned the sinister conﬁguration. Based on these and other data and d val- ues, the structure of 2 was deﬁned as (20S)-2-(propan-20- ol)-5-hydroxy-benzopyran-4-one. Compound 4 was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. Its HRESI mass spectrum exhibited a [M H2O + H]+ at m/z 163.0757 corresponding to a molecular formula C10H11O2. The absence of a carbonyl band in the IR spectrum suggested reduction at this po- sition relative to 3. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) revealed the presence of the same 1,3- dioxygenated; 1,2,3-trisubstituted aromatic system for 2 along with a spin-system corresponding to the C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-10 portion of structure 4. The equatorial and axial orientations of H-4, H-2, H-3 and H-10 were Table 1 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectroscopic data for compounds 2 and 4 in DMSO-d6 a Position 2 4 1H (d) 13C (d) gHMBC NOESY 1H (d) 13C (d) gHMBC 2 – 170.0 – – ax4.24 m 66.6 C-9 3 6.32 s 109.5 C-10, C-10 H-10a, H-20 ax1.50 ddd (14.7, 14.7, 4.0) 38.0 – – – eq1.88 ddd (14.7, 4.0, 4.0) – 4 – 182.0 – – eq4.72 br s 57.1 C-10 5 – 159.9 – – – 156.8 – 6 6.79 d (8.0) 110.7 C-10 – 6.20 dd (8.0, 1.0) 106.9 – 7 7.63 t (8.0) 135.6 C-5, C-9 – 6.92 t (8.0) 128.7 – 8 7.03 d (8.0) 107.3 C-10 – 6.33 dd (8.0, 1.0) 106.5 – 9 – 156.3 – – – 156.0 – 10 – 109.9 – – – 112.4 – 10a 2.68 d (8.5) 43.5 C-2, C-3 H-3 eq1.32 d (6.0) 21.2 C-2, C-3 10b 2.76 d (4.5) – – – – – 20 4.10 m 64.2 – H-3 – – – 30 1.18 d (6.0) 23.4 C-10 – – – – 5-OH 12.70 s – – – – – – 20-OH 4.92 d (4.5) – – – – – – a Chemical shifts (relative to TMS) are in (d) ppm, coupling constants in Hz in parentheses.

Small J-values showed by H-4 suggested vicinal eq–eq and eq–ax cou- plings with H2-3. The H-3eq showed constants that sug- gested a vicinal coupling eq–eq (4.0 Hz) with H-2 and eq–ax (4.0 Hz) with H-4 and a geminal coupling (14.7 Hz) with H-3ax. The 14.7, 14.7 and 4.0 Hz J-values for H-3ax indicated a geminal coupling, a vicinal ax–ax coupling with H-2 and an ax–eq coupling with H-4, respectively. Based on the conformational preference of methyl group over hydroxyl, the methyl group at C-2 was assumed to be in an equatorial position on a half-chair ring, which is the preferred conformation for benzopyrans (Joshi and Merchant, 1984). Therefore, due to equatorial position determined for H-4, com- pound 4 was characterized as the trans-isomer at H-4- H-2. All NMR signals were assigned by analysis of gHMQC and gHMBC experiments (Table 1) and d val- ues. Compound 4 was thus identiﬁed as the previously unreported 2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-benzopyran-4,5-diol. Compounds 1–4 (see Scheme 1) were evaluated against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladospo- rioides using direct bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited a weak antifungal activity, showing a detection limit of 10 lg for both sub- stances. Compound 3 and 4 did not show any antifungal activity. Nystatin was employed as a positive control showing a detection limit of 1 lg. The reduction at D2,3 in 3, changing the conformation of the pyrane ring, may be the cause of the loss of the activity. Biological evaluation of 1–4 was also carried out using HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines. Compound 2, at 20 lmol/L was able to induce 70% increase in cell proliferation to HeLa and 25% to CHO cells, when compared to the DMSO treated cells. The compounds 1, 3 and 4 were inactive in CHO and displayed a weak stimulatory eﬀect in HeLa cells. When cisplatin, a well known antineoplas- tic agent, was used as a control, a clear inhibition of cell proliferation was observed. The biological activity of 1 and 2 seems to be diﬀer- entially speciﬁc to fungi or mammalian cells, and also to diﬀerent mammalian cell lines. The indication of a possible speciﬁc mechanism of action is of great interest and deserves further investigation. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin–Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 C. UV spectra were recorded on a Shi- madzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Nicolet Impact-400 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were re- corded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as an internal standard. HRESI mass spectra were obtained on an Autospec-Micromass mass spectrometer. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm · 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm · 21.2 mm) preparative column. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated O. corymbosa plant material was col- lected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Experimental de Araraquara’’, Ara- raquara, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in 2001. The botanical identiﬁcation was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No MCMY-1314). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus For the isolation of the endophytic fungus, adult and healthy leaves were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, and immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlo- rite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was per- formed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 · 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato–dextrose–agar) and anthamicine sulfate O OCH3 O O OH O O OCH3 O O OH OH OH 2 4 6 8 1' 2' 3' 1 2 3 4 2 4 6 8 1' Scheme 1. H.L. Teles et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 2363–2367 2365 (50 mg/mL) with approximately three to four pieces on each dish. The material was incubated at 25 C for 10 days and the endophyte Curvularia sp. was isolated by replication and preserved in sterile water (Maier et al., 1997). The fungus was identiﬁed by Dr. Jose´ Odair Pere- ira (UFA) and deposited in NuBBEs collection with culture number ‘‘PAJ-04’’. 3.4. Growth of Curvularia and production of the EtOAc extract The fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlen- meyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 C for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 · 1 cm) of PDA med- ium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the Curvularia isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was partitioned with ethyl ace- tate (3 · 200 mL). Collection and evaporation of the or- ganic phase in vacuo yielded a brown solid residue (158 mg). After this extract was found to display bioac- tivity, this process was scaled up using 4.0 L of PDB (20 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) and aﬀorded 1.8 g of EtOAc extract. 3.5. Antifungal assay The microorganisms C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. The compounds 1–4 were applied on a pre- coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 lL) con- taining 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 lg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as posi- tive control. 3.6. Determination of cell viability after treatment with benzopyrans HeLa (human cervix tumor) and CHO (Chinese ham- ster ovary) cells were cultured at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2, using Dulbeccos modi- ﬁed Eagles medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Penicillin (100 lg/mL) and streptomycin (100 lg/ mL) were included in medium to prevent bacterial growth. A stock solution (20 mmol/L) was prepared by dissolving compounds 1–4 in DMSO (vehicle). The ﬁnal concentrations (200, 20 and 2 lmol/L) were achieved by direct dilution into the cell medium. Cells were plated (104 cells/well) in a 48-well tray 24 h prior to the beginning of the experiment. After addition of the compound or the vehicle, cells were analyzed after a period of 48 h using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983; Rubinstein et al., 1990). 3.7. Extraction and isolation The EtOAc extract (1.8 g) was fractionated by col- umn chromatography (CC) using reversed-phase silica gel (ODS) and eluted with a MeOH–H2O gradient (1:9 100% MeOH) aﬀording 8 fractions (A–H). Fraction A (125 mg) was further puriﬁed using reverse phase prep. HPLC [k = 221 nm, 12.0 mL/ min., CH3CN:H2O (2:8)] aﬀording 1 (2.2 mg) and 2 (1.8 mg). Fraction B (100 mg) was also puriﬁed using reversed phase prep. HPLC [k = 230 nm, 12.0 mL/min., CH3CN:H2O (23:77)], aﬀording 3 (10.2 mg) and ﬁnally fraction C (770 mg) was also submitted to reverse phase prep.

Jack, which is native to Southeast Asia, was introduced to Brazil and has flourished in Slo Paulo state. In Brazil it is used as an ornamental plant, but this plant is used for its med- icinal properties in tropical and subtropical Asia [l]. A search for previous phytochemical studies of M. paniculuta revealed that only the coumarin, coumur- rayin, has been reported from the ripe fruits of this species [2]. Working separately on peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits, we have isolated only poly- methoxylated flavones, flavonols and flavanonols. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The dichloromethane extract of the peel of M. puniculata after successive chromatographic sep- arations afforded six flavonoids: 5,7,3’,4’,5’-penta- methoxyflavanonol[3,4], 5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxy- flavone (1) [5], 3,5,7,8,3’,4’,5’-heptamethoxyflavone (2) [6], 5,7,8,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavone (3) [7], 5- hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavone (4) and 8- hydroxy-3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyllavone (5). Com- pounds 4 and 5 appear to be novel. The i3C NMR data for 2 and 3 do not appear to have been reported in the literature. Thus, the 13C chemical shifts of 2 and 3 have been listed in Table 1 using 1 and 5,7,8,2’,3’,4’,5’-heptamethoxyflavone (6) [3] as models. The carbon signals of 1, isolated from *Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by R.J.F. to the Universidade Federal de Slo Carlos. t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Neoraputia magniJica (Rutaceae), were assigned by use of HMQC and HMBC experiments [5]. Compound 4 was obtained as a yellow powder. The presence of a flavonoid nucleus was suggested by its UV and IR spectra. In the ‘H NMR spectrum (Table 2) of 4, three aromatic protons appeared at 6 6.43 (lH, s) and 6 7.52 (2H, s, H-2’ and H-6’), one hydroxyl group at 6 12.38 (lH, s, OH-5) and six methoxy groups at 6 3.95 (6H, s), 3.94 (6H, s), 3.92 (3H, s), and 3.90 (3H, s). The assignment of one singlet to H-2’ and H- 6’ suggested that three methoxyls were attached to the B-ring. Furthermore, the singlet at 6 6.43 clearly indicated the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisub- stituted. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5- hydroxy-7,8- and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3,7,8- and 5-hydroxy-3,6,7-tri- methoxyflavonol indicated that the C-6 methine (ca 6 96) resonates at a lower field than the C-8 methine (ca 6 91) [3]. Thus, the correct A-ring structure was, decided on the basis of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table l), which showed a signal at 6 95.5 for C-6, so placing the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-8. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for three meth- oxyl groups at 6 61.5, 61.0 and 60.3, indicating a 3- methoxyflavonol derivative and confirming the oxy- genation patterns in the A and B-rings. This was cor- roborated by the fragments at m/z 207 [C12H,404- Me]+ and 181 [C9H805 -Me]+, associated with the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of the C-ring followed by the loss of a methyl group, respectively. From these data 4 was characterized as 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’,5’- hexamethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spec- trum with those of 4’,5-dihydroxy-3,3’,7,8-tetra- methoxyflavone (ternatin, 7) and 4’,5-dihydroxy- 393 R. J.

Complete and unambiguous r3C NMR assign- ments for 8 were made using the HMBC technique PI. Compound 5 exhibited similar NMR spectra to 4 (Table 1 and 2) except for the absence of the signal for one chelated hydroxyl. The mass spectrum indicated a molecular formula C2,H2209 ([Ml+ = 418), which strongly suggested an isomer of 4. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals for two methoxyl groups at 6 6 1.3 and 60.1, which were assigned to the 3- and 4’- positions. This implies that the methoxyls in the A-ring were located at C-5 and C-7 (6 56.4 and 56.1) and determined the position of the hydroxyl group at C-8. The 5,7,8- and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones can be differentiated by the 13C NMR chemical shifts of the unsubstituted methine which absorbs at 6 92.6 OH 0 7:&=OMe &Rq=OPre (C-6, for example 6) in the case of the former [3] and at 6 96.3 (C-8, for example 1) in the case of the latter. Thus, the 13C signal at 6 91.6 for C-6 supported the proposed structure of 5 as 8-hydroxy-3,5,7,3’,4’,5’- hexamethoxyflavone. A hexane-soluble fraction of the hydromethanolic extract of pulp after successive chromatographic sep- arations afforded three flavonols: 4, 9 and 10. Com- pound 4 could not be separated from a small amount of 9. The ‘H NMR in addition to signals described above for 4, revealed the presence of three protons in the B-ring, giving rise to an ABC coupling system (6 7.02, d, J = 8.8 Hz, H-5’; 6 7.81, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H- 2’, 6 7.86, dd, J = 8.8 and 2.0 Hz, H-6’). This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed frag- ments at m/z 177 [C1rHn03-Me]+ and 181 [C,Hs05 - Me]+ due to the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage Flavonoids from Murraya paniculata Table 1. “C NMR chemical shift for compounds 2-5 and 10 and selected carbons in the model compounds 1 and 6-g 395 C 1 2 3 6 4 7 8 5 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1’ 2 3’ 4 5’ 6 OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe 161.0 108.3 117.2 154.5 140.4 157.8 96.3 152.6 112.9 126.9 103.4 153.6 140.9 153.6 103.4 56.4 56.4 56.4 61.1 61.6 62.2 156.1 139.6 174.0 151.6 91.9 156.2 130.0 150.5 108.8 125.9 105.2 152.8 141.0 152.8 105.2 55.8 55.8 56.1 56.2 59.7 62.0 62.4 160.2 158.0 155.1 107.8 112.3 138.8 177.8 177.7 179.0 151.9 151.8 158.5 92.3 92.6 95.5 156.6 156.3 157.4 130.5 130.5 128.8 156.3 156.1 147.1 108.7 106.0 105.0 126.6 119.7 125.6 103.1 147.2 105.9 153.4 145.4 153.1 140.7 149.2 140.1 153.4 147.4 153.1 103.1 106.0 105.9 55.9 56.0 56.2 56.1 56.1 56.2 56.2 56.4 56.4 56.5 61.0 60.3 61.0 61.1 61.0 61.4 61.2 61.5 156.9 139.2 179.8 158.3 96.6 159.4 129.8 149.2 105.2 122.4 112.9 149.1 152.1 117.3 123.9 56.3 56.9 60.4 61.9 156.8 139.2 179.8 158.2 97.7 158.8 130.1 149.4 106.2 122.5 112.9 149.0 152.1 117.3 123.9 56.1 60.5 61.9 156.1 137.7 172.3 150.8 91.6 156.8 130.3 141.6 105.9 126.5 104.6 153.2 139.3 153.2 104.6 56.1 56.1 56.1 56.4 61.0 61.3 157.7 140.1 173.7 153.5 140.2 157.8 96.0 152.4 113.1 125.1 105.8 153.1 141.1 153.1 105.8 56.4 56.4 56.4 60.1 61.0 61.6 62.3 Table 2. ‘H NMR chemical shift for compounds 4,5 and 9 H 6 2 5 6 OH OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe 4 6.43 s 7.52 s 7.52 s 12.38 s 3.90 s 3.92 s 3.94 s 3.94 s 3.95 s 3.95 s 5 6.42 s 7.61 s 7.61 s 3.92 s 3.93 s 3.95 s 3.95 s 3.95 s 4.02 s 9 6.43 s 7.81 d(2.0) 7.02 d (8.8) 7.86 dd (8.8,2.0) 12.47 s 3.89 s 3.91 s 3.93 s 3.96 s 3.98 s of the C-ring followed by loss of a methyl group, respectively. These data were consistent with the struc- ture of 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’-pentamethoxytlavone for 9, which has been found previously in Citrus retic- ulutu (tangerine peel) [9]. Compound 10 gave spectral data in agreement with those published for 3,5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hepta- methoxyilavonol [lo]. However, its 13C NMR data do not appear to have been reported previously in the literature. Thus, they have been listed in Table 1 using 1, 2 and 3 as models. A dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the meth- anolic pulp extract gave four flavonoids: 3, 5, 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanonol [3, 41 and 3,5,7, 8,3’,4’-hexamethoxyflavone [3, 111. Other organs of M. paniculata have long been the subject of extensive chemical investigations, which have proved that it is a rich source of coumarins, flavones and flavonols as are other plants of the Aur- antioideae [12]. The leaves have been reported to con- tain 2 [13], 3 [l, 131 and 10 [lo], while 3 has also been found in the roots [7]. Flavonol 1 has been isolated from the leaves of M. exotica [6], which has been considered to be a synonym of M. paniculata [14]. By contrast, the flowers appear to be poor in flavonoids. However, the only flavonol, 3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexame- thoxyflavone, reported from the flowers shows an oxi- dation level comparable to those of the leaves. Flavonol 9, 3,5,7,8,3’,4’-hexamethoxyflavone and 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanonol are reported for the first time from the Murruya, while the latter does not appear to have been recorded previously from the Rutaceae.

Isolation of compounds. The seeds, peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits were sepd by a perforated plate sieve (0.5 mm; tyler 32). The seeds and peel were dried, powdered and successively extracted with hexane, CH,C12 and MeOH. The pulp was stirred with MeOH at room temp. The extract was decanted, and the residual pulp similarly extracted a second time. The combined extracts were evapd under vacuum and the residue partitioned into hexane-, CH2C12-, MeOH- and n-BuOH-soluble frs. The coned CH2C1, extract of peel was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane- Me,CO (9:1), yielding 48 frs.

This flagel- late protozoan is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, an illness that affects 16–18 million peo- ple in Central and South America, and led to 14,470 deaths in 2002 [1]. At the moment, blood transfusion is one of the most important ways of transmission of this disease. However, gentian violet, the only trypanocidal substance available to prevent the infection by this route, shows limi- ted use due to undesirable effects on the patients [2]. Furthermore, the treatment of Chagas' dis- ease is still insufficient since the two available drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, can only be used for the early chronic phase of the illness. Ac- cording to the World Heatlh Organization (WHO), discovery and development of more effective and better tolerated drugs are still research challenges [3]. Thus, the search for both a prophylactic drug to be added to human blood as well as a safe and reliable therapeutic drug is needed. In this context, higher plants are a potential source of compounds with high activity and low toxicity [4], [5]. In fact, the investigation of these compounds has received increasing attention in the past years [6] and several active natural prod- ucts have been identified as trypanocides [4], [5], [7], [8], [9]. We have investigated plants from the order Ru- tales with the aim to identify biologically active compounds. We have also found that a number of natural products from Meliaceae and Rutaceae showed in vitro activity against T. cruzi [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Moreover, the Melia- ceae family has been pointed out as an important source of lead trypanocidal compounds [10], [14], [17], [18]. So, due to this high biological potential, we chose to investigate the species Cedrela fissilis, to search for new trypanocidal compounds. In this paper, we report the trypanocidal activity of 15 crude extracts, and 14 compounds includ- ing limonoids and triterpenes from Cedrela fissilis. We also describe the identification of 25 compounds (6 limonoids, 12 triterpenes, 1 ses- quiterpene, 5 steroids, and 1 flavonoid) from this species for the first time. Materials and Methods General procedures Compounds were identified through NMR and low resolution EI-MS, which were acquired on Bruker DRX 400 and on Micromass Quattro LC in- struments, respectively. Abstract Chagas' disease is an illness that affects millions of people in Central and South America. The search for both a prophylactic drug to be added to human blood as well as a safe and reliable therapeutic drug are greatly needed to control such disease. Herein, we report the trypanocidal activity of 15 crude extracts and 14 compounds (limonoids and triterpenes) as well as the isola- tion of 25 known compounds (6 limonoids,12 tri- terpenes,1 sesquiterpene, 5 steroids, and 1 flavo- noid) from Cedrela fissilis. The present study shows that this plant is a promising source of ac- tive compounds for the control of Chagas' dis- ease. The inhibitory activity found for odoratol indicates that it is potentially useful as an alter- native for the chemoprophylactic gentian vio- let. Leite ACet al. Trypanocidal Activity of… Planta Med 2008; 74: 1795–1799 Downloaded by: University of Queensland. Copyrighted material. Plant material Fruits, branches, stems, roots and leaves from Cedrela fissilis Vell. were collected in São Carlos-SP, Brazil, on 01/06/01 and identi- fied by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP where a voucher specimen (6701) was depos- ited at that department. Extraction and isolation The powdered air-dried parts of C. fissilis were extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The hexane extract from the roots of C. fissilis (RH, 3.5 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70–230 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 1.5 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The dichloromethane fraction (RHD, 834.1 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm), eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (8:1.5:0.5) to give 9 fractions. Fraction 2 (RHD-2, 290.5 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm), using hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone (8:1.5:0.5) to yield compound 19 (28.0 mg). Several column chromatographies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm, eluent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) and Sephadex LH-20 (3×50 cm, eluent MeOH) of the acetate ethyl fraction (RHA, 704.8 mg) allowed the isolation of the triterpene 18 (11.5 mg). The dichloromethane extract from roots (RD, 1.0 g) was fractio- nated through column chromatography on silica gel (70– 230 mesh, 4×45 cm), eluting with hexane to MeOH, to afford nine fractions. Limonoid 1 (12.1 mg) was obtained from fraction 5 (RD-5, 143.0 mg) through three successive chromatography columns on silica gel (70–230 and 230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm) and gradient elution (hexane to MeOH and hexane-CH2Cl2-ace- tone, 6:3:1). Fraction 6 (RD-6, 192.0 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×50 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (6:3:1) to yield compounds 3 (1.3 mg) and 10 (1.1 mg). The dichloromethane extract from leaves (LD, 29.0 g) was sub- mitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70– 230 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 2 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The dichloromethane fraction (LD-D, 6.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh) and florisil (1:1, 4.5×50 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane to MeOH) to afford 12 fractions. From fraction 4 (LD-D-4, 1.2 g), after two col- umn chromatographies on silica (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm, elu- ent hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3.5:0.5) and HPLC on silica Hyper- sil 5 μm column (1×29 cm), with hexane-2-propanol (8.5:1.5) isocratic elution and UV detection at 240 nm, limonoid 2 (5.1 mg) was isolated. Fraction 7 (LD-D-7, 800.3 mg) was chro- matographed twice on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 3×45 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3.5:0.5) to yield compound 5 (3.5 mg). The chromatographic separation of fraction 9 (LD-D-9, 1.0 g) by column chromatography (silica gel 70–230 mesh, 3×35 cm, elu- ent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 7:2:1) and normal HPLC (Hypersil 5 μm column, 1×29 cm, hexane-2-propanol 9:1, UV detection at 220 nm) afforded limonoids 4 (9.3 mg) and 6 (4.5 mg). The methanol extract from stems (SM, 40.0 g) was submitted to liquid-liquid partition chromatography with hexane-MeOH- H2O, CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O, EtOAc-MeOH-H2O, and n-butanol- MeOH-H2O. The hexane and dichloromethane fractions (SM- HD, 11.8 g) were chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 (4×50 cm) using CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1) as eluent to give 10 fractions. Several chromatographic procedures on silica (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm) and cromatotron of fraction 2 (SM-2, 2.3 g), using both isocratic (hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3.5:0.5) and gradient elution (CH2Cl2 until MeOH), allowed the isolation of 7 (35.6 mg), 8 (40.2 mg), and 14 (32.7 mg). Fraction 4 (SM-4, 3.5 g) was submitted to two column chromatographies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×45 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9.5:0.5) and cromatotron, with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3:1) elution, to afford 11 (33.5 mg) and 12 (23.1 mg). Compounds 9 (10.1 mg) and 13 (13.2 mg) were obtained from fraction 7 (SM-7, 2.1 g) through column chromatography on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9.5:0.5) and cromatotron (eluent hexane- CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3:1). The dichloromethane extract from fruits (FD, 5.0 g) was submit- ted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (230– 400 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 1.5 L of CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The ethyl acetate fraction (FDA, 3.0 g) was submitted to column chromatography on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) to yield 7 frac- tions. Fraction 2 (FDA-2, 715.0 mg) was twice chromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (6:3:1) to afford compounds 16 (36.5 mg) and 17 (25.9 mg). The triterpene 15 (4.3 mg) was obtained through col- umn chromatography on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 1.5×20 cm, eluent hexane-EtOAc, 7:3) and Sephadex LH-20 (1.5×30 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 1:1) from fraction 3 (FDA-3, 633.2 mg). Finally, the flavonoid 20 (48.9 mg) was isolated from the metha- nol extract from fruits (FM) through several column chromatog- raphies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×35 cm, eluent hexane until MeOH) and Sephadex-LH-20 (1.5×30 cm, eluent MeOH). Bioassay The procedure for in vitro assays on blood trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi was previously described by Ambrozin et al. [10]. Di- methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to prepare standard solu- tions of the crude extracts and compounds, which were added to the infected mouse blood to provide concentrations of 4 mg/ mL and 50, 100, and 250 μg/mL, respectively. The final concen- tration of DMSO was 1% (v/v). The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) that were incubated at 4°C for 24 h. The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (μmol/L) for pure com- pounds were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0. Results and Discussion In the present work, we assessed the trypanocidal activity of 15 extracts from fruits, branches, stems, roots and leaves of C. fissilis. The results, which are summarized in ● Table 1, showed that 11 extracts (73%) were significantly active (lysis% ≥50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. Moreover, nine of them presented lysis in the 60–80% range; the dichloro- methane extract of roots (RD) was the most active, reducing the number of parasites in the infected blood by 97.4%. Such results suggest that C. fissilis is really a promising source of trypanocidal compounds, as we expected from the previous works that had reported the antiprotozoal action of Meliaceae plants [10], [14], [16], [17], [18]. Thus, we carried out the chemical investigation of C. fissilis with the aim to isolate the compounds from some ac- tive extracts (RD, LD, FD, FM, and SM), and one inactive extrtact (RH). This work allowed the isolation of the limonoids (● Fig. 1): Original Paper 1796 Leite ACet al. Trypanocidal Activity of… Planta Med 2008; 74: 1795–1799 Downloaded by: University of Queensland. Copyrighted material. 3β-acetoxycarapin (1) [19], 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (2) [20], gedunin (3) [20], photogedunin (4), methyl angolensate (5), and 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (6) [20]; the triter- penes: hispidol A (7), piscidinol A (8), pentaol (9), nilocetin (10), odoratol (11), iso-odoratol (12), odoratone (13), 22S,3α-di- hydrotirucala-7,24-dien-23-one (14), 3,11-dioxoolean-12-en-28- onic acid (15), oleanonic acid (16) [19], oleanolic acid (17) [19], and 24-methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-one (18); the sequi- terpene criptomeridiol (19); the flavonoid ent-catechin (20); in addition to the steroids β-sitosterol, stigmaterol, campesterol, sitostenone, and 3β-O-β-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol. Fourteen compounds were assayed in vitro against the trypo- mastigote forms of T. cruzi (● Table 2). The results showed that the tirucallane-type triterpenes (7–13) were the most active ones. The results in ● Table 2 show that the trypanocidal activi- ty of odoratol (11) was better than that of gentian violet, the pos- itive control, when we compared the evaluated concentrations. This triterpene was isolated from the methanol extract from stems (SM, 58.0%), together with the tirucallane triterpenes his- pidol A (7), piscidinol A (8), pentaol (9), iso-odoratol (12), odor- atone (13) and 22S,3α-dihydrotirucala-7,24-dien-23-one (14).

So, odoratol (11) and iso-odor- atol (12) showed higher activity than hispidol A (7) and odora- tone (13). On the other hand, odoratone (13) was more active than piscidinol A (8). In general, oleanane-type triterpenes (15–17) were more active than limonoids (1–4), but less active than tirucallane triter- penes (7–13). They were isolated from the active dichlorome- thane extract from fruits of C. fissilis (FD, 75.4%) together with photogedunin (4). Among them, oleanolic acid (17) showed the highest activity displaying an IC50 value of 80.4 μM, which is near to the one observed for gentian violet [21]. It seems that for this class of compounds the trypanocidal activity is related to the presence of a hydroxy group at C-3. This observation cor- roborates the statement by Cunha et al [21], [22] that the free hydroxy at C-3 and the polarity of C-28 are the most influential structural features for the in vitro trypanocidal activity of olea- nane triterpenes. Besides anti-inflammatory, immunomodulato- ry, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimutagenic, antihepatotoxic, anti- diabetic, hemolytic, antiviral and antibacterial activity [23], the trypanocidal action of oleanane triterpenes has already been de- scribed previously [21], [22], [24], [25], [26]. Actually, oleanolic acid (17) showed trypanocidal activity on both trypomastigote [21], [25] and epimastigote forms [24], [26] of T. cruzi. Mexicanolide and gedunin-type limonoids (1–4) showed low trypanocidal activity. In a previous work, mexicanolide limo- noids displayed only weak activity on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi [14]. These results suggest that tirucallane-type triterpenes are a promising class of new trypanocidal compounds. The high try- panocidal activity of odoratol (11) (100% at 100 μg/mL) indicates that it has potential as an alternative for the chemoprophylactic gentian violet, which has many side effects [2]. However, toxicity assays have not been performed for 11 yet. In conclusion, the present study showed that C. fissilis, a plant from the Meliaceae family, is a promising source of active com- pounds for control of Chagas' disease. Specifically, we demon- strate the potential activity of tirucallane and oleanane-type tri- terpenes. The high activity of odoratol (11) is promising although it asks for further optimization and for assessment of toxicity.
