The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artificial diet at 1 mg g\\({}^{-1}\\) and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superficial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g\\({}^{-1}\\). Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic _S. densiflora_ extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from _V. polygamma_ were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, flavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition.\n\n(c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry 2006 62 1072 1081 2006 1\n\nTaruma; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; _Vitex polygamma; Siphoneugena densiflora; Spodoptera frugiperda_; botanical insecticide; pest control\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nWith a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efficacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3\n\n_Spodoptera frugiperda_ JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Nocutuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important field crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by consuming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4\n\nOf the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, _Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5-9 This plant is commonly called 'Maria-Preta', 'Taruma', 'Congonha-cinco-folhas' and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, _Siphoneugena densiflora_ Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in Sao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named 'Uvatinga',13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nEven though the selected plant species have not been ordinarily employed in pest control, their families comprise several species with injurious properties to insects reported in the literature.15-21 The present paper specifically deals with the effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from _V, polygamma_ and _S. densiflora_ against fall armyworm (_S. frugiperda_). Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### General\n\nHeteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, \\(J\\) 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethaneol) from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck-Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei Munchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low-resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple-quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectrophotometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pellets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Australia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 x 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software.\n\nColumn chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70-230 or 230-400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), Sephadex(r) LH-20 (25-100 mm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7(r) (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled.\n\n### Plants\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ were collected in July 2000, in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil, respectively.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after filtration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 degC. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 x 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting filtrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 degC) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid-liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1.\n\nCompounds **1** to **43** were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (**1, 9, 14** to **18, 25, 26** and **43;** see Fig. 1) are described below. Some of them, like compounds **15** and **16**, were isolated from more than one different extract of the same plant.\n\n#### Isolation of compounds **13** to **19** from Siphoneugena densiflora (_SD-EMR layer_)\n\nA quantity of 9 g of SD-EMR (Table 1) was subjected to CC using silica gel (38.0 x 5.0 cm) with dichloromethane + ethyl acetate (7 + 3 by volume) as eluent and gradient elution.

The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a final concentration of 1 mg g-1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 x 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 degC), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One first-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 +- 1 degC, 70 +- 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single first-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot's formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 x 6.0 cm) containing filter paper at the bottom (4.0 x 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10-20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence.\n\nThe control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground.\n\nMethanoic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls.\n\n#### 2.5.2 Isolated compounds\n\nFour well plates (24 x 1.5 mL wells) were filled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar flow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 mL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artificial congealed diet. The final concentration was about 0.1 mg g-1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot's formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound.\n\n### _Statistical analysis_\n\nData consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment means were established by Tukey's test.24 Results are given in the text as probability values, with \\(P\\) < 0.05 adopted as the criterion of significance.

They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid-liquid partition.\n\nPartition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD-AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2).\n\nThe VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of _Vitex madiensis_ caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in _S. frugiperda_.30 Ecdysteroids **9** to **12** (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract.\n\nFlavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufficient amounts to be bioassayed. The flavonoids quercetin (**25**) and quercetin (**26**) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (**25**) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450-dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione _S_-transferases from _S. frugiperda_.35 In addition, quercetin (**26**), a flavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not significantly different (_P_ < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound **17**, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity.\n\n### _Developmental effects_\n\nIn general, no statistically significant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP-HL and VP-HF, which showed significantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage.\n\nCompound **9**, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statistically significant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (_P_ < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmental stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result.\n\nAlthough the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds **14** and **43** (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins **15** and **17** were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea-Bulla _et al._,38 gallic acid (**13**), the compound isolated from several extracts of _S. densiflora_ and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound **14**, significantly reduces larval growth of _S. frugiperda_ at 1 mg g-1.\n\n## 4 CONCLUSIONS\n\nPolar extracts from _S. densiflora_ and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efficient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of _S. frugiperda_. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin **14** along with the insecticidal effects of flavonoids **25** and **26** might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound **14** might be acting synergistically with **43**, and in concert with daucosterol (**19**), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid **13** and other\n\n## Page 9\n\ncompound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr Fatima R Salimena-Pires (Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora - UFJF) and Marcos Sobral (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG) for botanical identifications, and to ALCOA Alumimio S/A for facilitating plant collections.

The genus _Styrax_ is different from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammatory diseases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styracaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985; Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988; Anil, 1980; Segal et al., 1967, 1964; Ulubelen et al., 1978; Kawai and Sugimoto, 1940; Kitagawa et al., 1974; Ulubelen, 1976; Nakano et al., 1967).\n\nFrom the leaves of _Styrax ferrugineus_ Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**4**) and the known _nor_-lignans 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**1**), 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**2**), 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**3**) and the lignan dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (**5**), together with ursoclinic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds **1-2** showed inhibitory properties against the microorganisms, _Candida albicans, Cladosporium cladesoporiades_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_, whereas compounds **3-5** inhibited only _S. aureus_ and _C. albicans_. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elucidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and 2).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves of _Styrax ferrugineus_ were extracted with a mixture of CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)--CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH (2:1 v/v). Evaporation gave an extract, which showed\n\n## Page 2\n\nantimicrobial activity, detected by inhibition of _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ (Table 3). The bioactive extract was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with _n_-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOHAc (4x300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by purification on preparative HPLC afforded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (**4**) and the known _nor_-lignans (**1**) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (**2**) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and (**3**) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (**5**) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identified by chromatographic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The triterpenes and sterols were identified by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13C NMR spectral data for 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-methylene-dioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**1**) and 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**2**). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13C NMR spectral data for **1** and **2** are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC correlations are presented in Fig. 1.\n\nCompound **2** was obtained earlier from the seeds of _S. officinalis_ (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent purification of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of _S. camporum_ (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucidation of compound (**4**) as well as the antimicrobial activities of all lignoids isolated.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The molecular formula C26H32O10 was deduced from ES-MS _m_/_z_ [M + Na]+ 527, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. Its IR spectrum recorded hydroxyl (3550-3200 cm 1), unsaturated (1650 cm 1) and aromatic (1550, 870 cm 1) absorptions, and its UV absorbance\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline Carbon & **1a** & **2b** & **4c** \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 156.06 \\(s\\) & 156.35 \\(s\\) & 156.12 \\(s\\) \\\\\n3 & 100.32 \\(d\\) & 100.27 \\(d\\) & 101.12 \\(d\\) \\\\\n4 & 112.28 \\(d\\) & 112.28 \\(d\\) & 112.12 \\(d\\) \\\\\n5 & 137.50 \\(s\\) & 137.49 \\(s\\) & 137.85 \\(s\\) \\\\\n6 & 1\n\n## Page 3\n\n(MeOH) was at 312.0 and 216.5 nm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Tables 1 and 2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of **4** with those described for **2** indicated that **4** is a glucoside derivative of compound **2**. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum of **4** displayed four doublets at \\(\\delta\\) 6.77 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 7.44 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 1.9; 8.0 Hz) attributable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 7.17 (1H, _s_) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, _s_), two triplets due to methylene protons at \\(\\delta\\) 2.75 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at \\(\\delta\\) 1.86 (2H, _dt_, \\(J\\) = 7.8 Hz). This \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of compound **2**. Further analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 4.11 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) and several signals at \\(\\delta\\) 4.33-3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound **4**. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **4** (Table 2) suggested the presence of a _nor_-ligman with similar skeleton to **2**. The main difference observed in the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **4** was due to the presence of the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH\\({}_{2}\\)) which confirmed a glucosyl moiety. The \\({}^{1}\\)H--\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C-three-bond (HMBC) correlations from the H-\\({}^{1\\prime\\prime}\\) protons resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 107.64 and 112.12 identified the later as C-4. The \\({}^{3}\\)_J_ HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and C-4\\({}^{\\prime}\\) quaternary carbons with H-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\) proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-tri-substituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound **4**. Other significant correlations for confirmation of **4** are depicted in Fig. 1.\n\nThe extract and compounds isolated from _S. ferrugineus_ were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_, respectively. Compounds **1-2** exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_, whereas compounds **3-5** inhibited only _S. aureus_ and _C. albicans_. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ could be predictive for the activity against _C. albicans_. In conclusion, the activities of compounds **1-5** may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infections in several Brazilian regions.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and 50 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and 100 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\), respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70-230 and 230-400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F\\({}_{254}\\) plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) after heating.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Styrax ferrugineus_ Ness et Mart.

A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Bioassay\n\nThe crude extract and purified lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium _S. aureus_ ATCC 12228, the fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast _C. albicans_ ICB 12. Stock solutions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure compounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appropriate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on pre-coated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as positive and negative controls, respectively. For the antifungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of _C. sphaerospermum_ in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 27degC. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with _C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of _C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30degC for 24 h.\n\n### Extraction\n\nDried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of _Styrax ferrugneus_ Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2-CH3OH (2:1, v/v) at room temperature. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH-H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOHAc. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respectively. The CHCl3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel flash (77.9 g, 230-400 mesh, Merck) using a CH2Cl2-CH3OH gradient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran **(1)**, and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran **(2)**. Fr. 40-41 (39.4 mg) was fractionated by micron silica gel flash CC (Merck) using CH2Cl2-CH3OH (95:5) as eluent to afford 11 Frs. Frs. 5-9 gave a mixture of unsolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52-55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica flash CC (11.6 g, 230-400 mesh, Merck) using Hex-EtoAc-CH3OH (6:2:2) as eluent to afford 20 Frs. Frs 6-12 furnished dihydrohedjcolorifyl alcohol **(5)** (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH2Cl2-CH3OH gradient yielded 22 Frs.

The compounds were separated by recycling-HPLC, and their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. CD measurements were used to establish the absolute configuration of the anthrone and oxanthrone. The antifungal activity of 1-_O_-b- and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ was shown to be similar to that of the lignan sesamin. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Further investigations afforded, in minor quantities, two new _C,O_-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picraminoside F (**1**), and an anthrone, mayoside C (**2**), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**3**) and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of compounds **1** and **2**, and the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe EtOAc extract from the bark of _P. taepensis_ afforded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds **1**-**4**, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shimadzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones **3** and **4** were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992).\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-molecular ions at \\(m/z\\) 671 ([M+1]\\({}^{+}\\)), 693 ([M+Na]\\({}^{+}\\)) and 709 ([M+K]\\({}^{+}\\)), with the base peak at \\(m/z\\) 509 ([M+1-C6H10O5]\\({}^{+}\\)). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAll of the spectroscopic characteristics of **1** were coincident with those of anthrones which we have previously reported (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at _l_max 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)), ester carbonyl (1735 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) groups. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at \\(d\\) 7.4-7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of _meta_-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at \\(d\\) 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at \\(d\\) 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at \\(d\\) 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at \\(d\\) 3.40-3.95, indicating sugar moieties.\n\nThe presence of 33 carbons was evident from the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at \\(d\\) 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at \\(d\\) 95.8 and \\(d\\) 105.4. Signals in the region of \\(d\\) 62-81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D-E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agreement with lyxose (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on Solis et al. (1995) which identified the sugar of picramniosides A-C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-_O_ were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments confirmed only one CH\\({}_{2}\\) signal at \\(d\\) 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit.\n\nComplete assignment of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In particular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between the ester carbonyl (_d_ 164.7) and H-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\), H-2\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) and H-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\), indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) (_d_ 81.4), confirming the position of the aglycone at C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a \\({}^{3}J\\) correlation of the anomeric\n\n## Page 3\n\nproton of the glucose unit (H-1, \\(d\\) 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the _O_-glucose unit at C-8.\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between H-5' and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. The configuration of the lysrose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (Solis et al., 1995; Hernandez-Medel et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-1' and H-2' (_J_ = 0 Hz) suggesting an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. Likewise, the \\(J\\) value of H-5'' (12 Hz) indicated an _ax_-_ax_ conformation for H-5'' and H-4'' in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety.\n\nFurther observations helped to establish the configuration at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of **1** (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picraminoside E (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the following expected differences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to _O_-glucosylation at C-8.\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of **2** gave pseudo-molecular ions at _m_/_z_ 709 ([M + Na]+) and 725 ([M + K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]-), which was consistent with the molecular formula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS-MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (_m_/_z_ 563), lysose (_m_/_z_ 432), CH2OH (_m_/_z_ 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corresponding to emodin (269).\n\nAs observed previously for the mayosides (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed the same pattern described for **1**, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of **2** had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). _O_-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound **2** at ring A.\n\nAsignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with published data (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not afford all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1'' with C-1 (_d_ 162) helped to confirm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1''.\n\nCircular dichroism confirmed the absolute configuration at C-10 of **1** and **2** as \\(S\\) and \\(R\\), respectively.

(1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds **3** and **4** presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in _Sesamm indicum_. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nMp: uncorr.; IR: BOMEM-FT-IR; UV: Hewlett Packard 8452A; 1H NMR, COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HSQC, HMBC and 13C NMR, in methanol-_d__a_, containing TMS as int. standard: Bruker DRX-400; ESIMS: Micromass Quattro LC, HRMS: Autospec-Micromass EBE.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe bark of _P. taepensis_ was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San Jose de la Montana, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica.\n\n### Isolation of constituents\n\nDried and powdered bark of _P. taepensis_ (615 g) was macerated with EtOH-H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then _n_-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID x 50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml min-1 UV detector at 254 nm), to afford compound **1** (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-_O_-b- **(3)** and 8-_O_-b-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). Further purification of **3** (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and **4** (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described).

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of _Piper arboreum_ yielded two new amides, _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**1**), arboreumine (**2**) together with the known compounds _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_)-pentaenosyl]-pyrrolidine (**3**) and _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_), 9(_E_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**4**). Catalytic hydrogenation of **3** yielded the amide _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]-pyrrolidine (**5**). We also have isolated six amides (**6-11**) and two antifungal cinnamoxyl derivatives (**12, **13**) from seeds and leaves of _Piper tuberculatum_. Compounds **1**-**11** showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against _Cladosporium phaerosospermum_ while compounds **3-4** and **6-13** also showed antifungal activity against _C. cladosporioides_. (c) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.\n\n_Keywords: Piper arboreum; Piper tuberculatum_; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity\n\n+\nFootnote †: journal: Physica A\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nChemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, ligands and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996; Parmar et al, 1997; Alecio et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides _N_-[7-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_),4(_Z_)-heptadienoyl]pyrrolidine, (32,_S_Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of _Piper hspidium_ H. B. K. (Alecio et al., 1998) and 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxyscinnamoyl)-\\(\\Delta^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one from _Piper tuberculatum_ Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**1**), arboreumine (**2**) and nine **(3-11)** known antifungal amides _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_)-pentaenosyl]-pyrrolidinine (**3**), its derivative _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]-pyrrolidine (**5**) and _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_E_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**4**); besides pedilirine (**6**), \\(\\Delta^{\\text{a}\\text{b}}\\)-dihydropierine (**7**), piperidine (**8**), dihydropierine (**9**), _cis_-pieridine (or 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13, 14-trimethoxyscinnamoyl)-\\(\\Delta^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one) (**10**) and fagaramide (**11**). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxyscinnamate (**12**) and methyl _trans_-6,7,8-trimethoxyscinnamate (**13**). The amides isolated from leaves of _Piper arboreum_ (**1**-**4**) and the hydrogenated derivative of **3 (**5**)** were active against the fungus _Cladosporium phaerosospermum_, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of _Piper tuberculatum_ **3, 4** and 6**-**13**\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n(Navickiene et al., 2000) were also active against the fungi _Cladosporium sphaerospermann_ and _C. cladosporioides_, as evaluated by direct bioautography (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n_N_-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoil]-pyrrolidine (**1**) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm-1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at \\(d\\) 5.93 (2H, _s_), and four olefinic protons which showed signals at \\(d\\) 6.29 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)7,8 = 14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)8,7 = 14.3 and \\(J\\)8,9 = 10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)9,8 = 10.9 and \\(J\\)9,10 = 11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)10,9 = 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the \\(E\\) and \\(Z\\) geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the \\(E\\) and \\(Z\\) configurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of _trans-trans_ configuration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assignment of the _cis_ configuration for the g,d double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at \\(d\\) 3.52 (2H, _m_) and \\(d\\) 1.90 (2H, m) attributed to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of **1** were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-field region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at \\(d\\) 164.8, 10 sp2 carbons, four sp3 carbons [_d_C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at \\(d\\) 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Araujo-Junior et al., 1997; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000).\n\nArboreumine (**2**) was shown to have the molecular formula C23H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES-MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm-1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respectively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at \\(d\\) 2.15 (2H, \\(J\\)2a,2b - _?a,2b = 17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, \\(J\\)2b,2a -?b,2a = 17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H-2'a and H-2b, H-2'b which are characteristic of methylene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-9', at \\(d\\) 4.29 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\)10,9 - _?,8' = 5.0 Hz and \\(J\\)10,11 - _?,10' = 6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at \\(d\\) 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at \\(d\\) 1.20 (_J_11,10 - _?,9' = 6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-11'; H-13, H-12'; H-14, H-13' and H-11, H-10', respectively. The signal at \\(d\\) 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as confirmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-5'; H-8, H-7' and H-9, H-8' showed signals at \\(d\\) 5.81 (_q_, \\(J\\)6,12 - _?,11' = 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (_dd_, \\(J\\)8,9 -?,8' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)8,12 - _?,11' = 1.0 Hz) and 5.76 (_dd_, \\(J\\)9,8 -?,7' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)9,10 - _?,9' = 5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further confirmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spectrum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-7'; H-9, H-8' and H-10, H-9' was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.76 assigned to H-9, H-8' (_J_9,8 -?,7 = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)9,10 - _?,9' = 5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-7' (_J_8,9 -?,8' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)8,12 -?,11' = 1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at \\(d\\) 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-9' (_J_10,9 -?,8' = 5.0 Hz and \\(J\\)10,11 -?,10' = 6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at \\(d\\) 1.20 assigned to H-11, H-10' (_J_11,10 -?,9' = 6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at \\(d\\) 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-2'a (_J_2a,2b -?a,2b = 17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at \\(d\\) 2.37 assigned to H-2b, H-2'b (_J_2b,2a -?b,2a = 17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spectral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum. The carbon signals at \\(d\\) 49.5 and 40.9\n\n## Page 4\n\nassigned to C-2, C-2' and C-3, C-3', respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at \\(\\delta\\) 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the carbon (C-3 and C-3'), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at \\(\\delta\\) 198.3 and the 3H singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 0.95 (C-14 and C-13') indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3' was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-2'a and H-2b, H-2'b (\\(\\delta\\) 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3' (\\(\\delta\\) 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-12' and C-14, C-13' and H-14, H-13' and C-13, C-12' were also observed. The carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 163.9 (C-5, C-4'), 126.1 (C-6, C-5') and 40.9 (C-3, C-3') showed a correlation with the 1H singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 2.15 (H-2a, H-2'a), corroborating the adjacent relationship between the amide group and C-2, C-2'. The carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 67.3 (C-10, C-9') and 135.6 (C-9, C-8') showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-10' adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,t-unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambiguously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 11' with the carbon signals \\(\\delta\\) 126.1 (C-6, C-5') and 128.6 (C-8, C-7'), whereas the quadruplet at \\(\\delta\\) 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-5' (\\(J_{6,12-5,11'}\\)= 1.0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-7'). Finally, HETCOR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide **2** was determined as depicted.\n\nThe CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of _P. tuberculatum_ were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\) containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to afford compounds **6-13**. Pellitorine (**6**) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further purification, and it was identified by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data previously described by Rosario et al., 1996. d\\({}^{\\Delta,\\mathrm{b}}\\)dihydro piperine (**7**) and dihydropiplartine (**9**) had their \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra published for the same compounds previously isolated from _ Piper rugosum_ (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and _ Piper guineense_ (Parmar et al., 1997) and their \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (**8**) was isolated from seeds and leaves, and the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). _Cis_-piplartine (**10**) had its \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (**11**) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl _trans_-6,7,8-tri-methoxycinnamate (**13**) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectroscopic data were similar to that obtained in this work.\n\nThe antifungal activity of compounds **1-13** was determined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds **1-13** (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for _C. sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered.\n\nThe minimum amount of compounds **3-4**; **2** and **5**; and **1** required to inhibit growth of the fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds **3** and **4** showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the standards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against _C. cladosporioides_, the amide **4** being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds **6-10**, **13** and **11**, **12** the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus _C. cladosporioides_ on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for **6-10** and **13** indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from _P. arboreum_ are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l r} \\hline Position & **2** & \\\\ \\hline  & \\({}^{1}\\)H \\(\\delta\\) [\\(m\\), \\(J\\) (Hz), 500 MHz] & \\({}^{13}\\)C \\(\\delta\\)a  \\\\  & & (125 MHz) \\\\ \\hline\n1, 1′ & 2.80 (1H, \\(s\\)) & – \\\\\n2a, 2′a & 2.15 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{2a,2b,2b-2a,2b}\\)= 17.0) & 49.5 (_t_) \\\\\n2b, 2b & 2.37 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{2a,2b,2a-2b,2a}\\)= 17.0) & \\\\\n3, 3′ & – & 40.9 (_s_) \\\\\n4 & – & 198.3 (_s_) \\\\\n5, 4′ & – & 163.9 (_s_) \\\\\n6, 5′ & 5.81 (1H, \\(q\\), \\(J_{6,12-5,11'}\\)= 1.0) & 126.1 (_d_) \\\\\n7, 6′ & – & b \\\\\n8, 7′ & 5.70 (1H, \\(dd\\), \\(J_{8,9\n\n## Page 5\n\npiperidine, dihydropyridone and isobutyl amides from _P. tuberculatum_. It is important to note that the inhibition of _C. sphaerospermann_ by dihydropyridone amide **9** appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of _C. cladosporioides_ was lower than the standards (Table 4).\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2x250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), flow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were performed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Piper arboreum_ H. B. K. leaves were collected in Aranaquara--SP, Brazil and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias--USP, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil.\n\n_Piper tuberculatum_ Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA--Manaus, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias--USP, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil.\n\n### Antifungal assays\n\nThe microorganisms used in the antifungal assays _C. sphaerospermann_ (Penzig) SPC 491 and _C. cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay--10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds **1-5** and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds **6-13**, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of _C. sphaerospermann_ or _C. cladosporioides_ in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 degC. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of **1-5** and **6-13** required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and microazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nA CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of _P. arboreum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides **1-4**.\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves of _P. arboreum_ (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and conc. in vacuo to afford 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively. The resulting CH2Cl2 soluble\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compound & Antifungal activity a (μg) \\\\\n**3** & 0.1 \\\\\n**4** & 0.1 \\\\\n**6** & 5.0 \\\\\n**7** & 5.0 \\\\\n**8** & 5.0 \\\\\n**9** & 5.0 \\\\\n**10** & 5.0 \\\\\n**11** & 10.0 \\\\\n**12** & 10.0 \\\\\n**13** & 5.0 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Antifungal activity of compounds **6–13** against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compound & Antifungal activity a (μg) \\\\\n**1** & 10.0 \\\\\n**2** & 5.0 \\\\\n**3** & 0.1 \\\\\n**4** & 0.1 \\\\\n**5** & 5.0 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Antifungal activity of amides **1–5** against _Cladosporium sphaerospermann_\n\n## Page 6\n\npart (54.8 g) were applied to a silica gel column (300.0 g), and eluted with CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) containing increasing amounts of MeOH (up to 100%) to give 30 fractions.

The resulting extract of seeds was filtered and conc. in vacuo to afford 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **8** (33.0 mg) and **10** (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yielded **9** (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds **6** (0.2 g) and **7** (18.0 mg), respectively, without any further purification. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26-62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier. Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide **8** (0.9 g), without further purification.

A literature analysis pointed out its importance as a source of premylated bioactive molecules. The screening performed on aromatic acceptors (benzoic acids, phenols and phenylpropanoids) including geranyl diphosphate as premyl donor, showed the biotransformation of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid by the crude extract, and the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid by both the microsomal fraction and the crude extract, after treating leaves with glucose. The analysis of the products allowed the identification of _C_- and 0-geranylated derivatives, and the protease (subtilisin and pepsin) inhibition performed on the 0-geranylated compounds showed weak inhibition. Electrophoretic profiles indicated the presence of bands/spots among 56-58 kDa and pl 6-7, which are compatible with premyltransferases. These findings show that \\(P\\). _crassinervium_ could be considered as a source of extracts with geranyltransferase activity to perform biotransformations on aromatic substrates.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nBiotransformations are chemical reactions catalyzed by cells, organs or enzymes. They are different from biosynthesis, where complex products are assembled from simple substrates by whole cells, organs or organisms. Plant enzyme biocatalysts can be utilized to introduce new structural motifs on existing drugs expecting to improve their bioactivity, pharmacokinetic profile and also for the production of new drugs (Giri et al., 2001).\n\nSo far, natural products bearing one or more premyl groups have been isolated predominantly from higher plants. These compounds, originated from several natural product classes, often hold antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer activities (Epifano et al., 2008). Since the premylation of small aromatic molecules is a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of many natural products, the access to prenylation reaction catalysts might represent an advantageous short-cut to obtain premylated aromatic compounds (Yazaki et al., 2001; Haagena et al., 2007).\n\nAromatic geranyltransferases are a sub-class of premyltransferases that catalyzes _C_-geranylations on several aromatic substrates. Several examples of new aromatic premyltransferases have been reported from bacteria as soluble monomeric biocatalysts, with a relatively high promiscuity for aromatic substrates. In spite of the lack of a full elucidation of substrate- and regioselectivity, these enzymes were successfully employed to carry out either _C_- or _O_-prevalations of several compounds (Epifano et al., 2008). In plants, aromatic geranyltransferases are membrane-bound proteins, showing a strict substrate specificity for the endogenous premyl donor groups (e.g. DMAPP, GPP, etc.), although they may accept a variety of aromatic compounds as acceptors of the premyl moieties (Yazaki et al., 2001; Kuzuyama et al., 2005). There are few examples in which premyltransferases have been isolated and characterized from plants (Muhlenwege et al., 1998). Therefore, biotransformations using plant enzymatic extracts enriched in premyltransferase activity could be used as an alternative to obtain either known or new bioactive compounds.\n\nPiperaceae family is a basal angiosperm family, comprising more than 4000 species. Its species are chemically very rich and major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Parmar et al., 1997; Benesvides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003; Felippe et al., 2008), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alecio et al., 1998; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005). Belonging to this \n\n## Page 2\n\nfamily, _Piper_ is one of the most abundant genera, with approximately 2000 species (Wanke et al., 2007). _Piper crassineurium_ species accumulates antifungal, trypanocidal and antioxidant C-geranylated metabolites derived from both benzoic acid and _p_-hydroquinone (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008).\n\nIn spite of the knowledge on the chemical constituents and the biological potential of Piperaceae species, no comprehensive study has been made in order to survey such bioactive metabolites within the members of the family.\n\nHere we present a compilation that points out to the importance of _Piper_ genus as a source of bioactive compounds and, particularly, of _P. crassineurium_ as an enzyme source to perform geranylations on aromatic substrates. We report the biotransformation (i.e. the geranylation) of both the _p_-hydroxybenzoic and 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acids carried out by the enzymatic extracts from the leaves of _P. crassineurium_ besides the full characterization of two products as geranyl ester derivatives in addition to the characterization of one major product formed by biotransformation of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a C-geranylated derivative. Additionally, the inhibitory activity on HIV-like proteases was determined for the products as well as the electrophoretic characterization of catalytically active protein fractions by using SDS PAGE and 2-DE.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Literature survey and analysis\n\n'Piperaceae' and 'activity' were used as key words to perform a search in the available databases (e.g. _Science Direct_ and _ACS_ databases). All the obtained information was uploaded in a table according to genus, species, type of compound and biological activity reported (see the Electronic Annex in the online version of this article). Typical software Excel 2007(r) (Microsoft Corporation) was used to analyse and plot the obtained information.\n\n### Plant material\n\nFresh leaves of _P. crassineurium_ were collected from adults specimens cultivated from seeds under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara, SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo-Peru) and the voucher specimen (Kato-0084) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\n\nIncubation into _b_-D-glucose of young leaves from _P. crassineurium_. Leaves freshly excised from an adult plant were placed separately in 1.5 ml Eppendorf(r) tubes and each administrated 100 ml from a 10% solution of _b_-D-glucose in water at 25 degC for 72 h (Bergamo et al., 2005).\n\n### Synthesis and purification of geranyl diphosphate (GPP)\n\nIn a 100 ml round bottom flask 1 mmol of geraniol was mixed with 6 mmol of trichloroacetonitrile. Bis-triethylammonium phosphate (2.4 mmol in 20 ml of acetonitrile) was added drop-wise to the mixture over a period of 6 h, at room temperature under continuous stirring (Cornforth and Popjak, 1969). The mixture was further stirred for 12 h at room temperature and then, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 100 ml of ethyl ether, followed by extraction with 30 ml of NH4OH 0.1 M (3x). The basic solution was then re-extracted with 30 ml of ethyl ether (3x) and evaporated under reduced pressure. The GPP was purified by precipitation in acetonitrile at -20 degC overnight, compared with a commercial sample using TLC on cellulose (isopropanol/25% aqueous ammonia/water 50:25:25) and characterized by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): \\(d\\) 4.44 (H-1, \\(d\\) = 7.0 Hz), 5.41 (H-2, \\(t\\) = 7.0 Hz), 2.02-2.15 (H-4 and H-5, _m_), 5.17 (H-6, _m_), 1.59 (-_CH_3 = 8, _s_), 1.65 (-_CH_3 = 9, _s_), 1.66 (-_CH_3 = 10, _s_), 1.3C NMR (125 MHz, D2O): \\(d\\) 63.0 (-1, 1.243 (C-3, _d_), 143.6 (C-3, _d_), 2.58 (C-5), 120.0 (C-6), 133.9 (C-7), 2.50 (C-8), 1.72 (C-9) and 15.8 (C-10), 31P NMR (H3PO4, 202 MHz, D2O): \\(d\\) -9.75 (P-1), -1.40 (P-2).\n\nSynthesis, purification and characterization of the 0-geranyl derivatives of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid\n\nTo a stirred solution of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2 mmol) in dry DMF (10 ml), anhydrous potassium carbonate (6 mmol) was added and the solution stirred for 30 min at 40 degC under nitrogen atmosphere (Pisco et al., 2006). Geranyl bromide (4 mmol) was added drop-wise and the resulting mixture was heated and stirred at the same temperature for 8 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then poured into cold water (50 ml) added with 0.1% of HOAc, and extracted with CHCl3 (100 ml) and EtOAc (100 ml). The EtOAc layer was washed, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was submitted to column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230-400 mesh), iso-cratic elution with Hex-EtOAc (60:40)] yielding five fractions. Fraction 2 was characterized as compound **3**, fraction 4 as compound **4** and fraction 5 as compound **5**. The purified products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Fig. 4, Table 1).\n\nSynthesis, purification and characterization of the 0-geranyl derivatives of the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid\n\nThe _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid (1 mmol) dissolved in 5 ml of THF was added to a slurry of 5 g of Al2O3 neutral in ether (1 ml) (Glusenkamp and Buchi, 1986). The solvent was evaporated and geranyl bromide (3 mmol) in ether-hexane (30:70) was added. After stirring during 4 days, Al2O3 was filtered off and washed with 1% HOAC in EtOAc. The combined organic layer was evaporated and the products were purified using column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230-400 mesh), gradient elution with Hex 100%, Hex-EtOAc (90:10; 80:20; 50:50)], yielding 7 fractions. From fraction 3 it was characterized the geranyl ester derivative (**6**), whereas the geranyl ether derivative (**7**) was purified from fraction 4 by subsequent column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230-400 mesh), isocratic elution with Hex-EtOAc (80:20)]. The purified products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Table 2, Fig. 5).\n\n### Protein extraction\n\nLeaves of _P. crassineurium_ were harvested from an adult specimen and maintained in liquid N2. The frozen leaves (10 g) were triturated in a mortar with addition of 35% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 30 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 8). The homogenate was stirred slowly by 15 min in ice bath, filtered on gauze and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant (crude enzymatic extract), which was then submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis.\n\n### Microsomal fraction\n\nThe protocol was performed according to Muhlenweg et al. (1998) with minimal modifications. The supernatant (20 ml) obtained as described in Section 2.6 was subjected to ultracentrifuga\n\n## Page 3\n\ntion at 39,000 rpm for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 1 M KCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol, and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspension was subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. The supernatant was discarded, and the tube was carefully rinsed with 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The pellet was then resuspended in 10 ml of 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 2 M KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 4 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonium]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPSO), and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspension was ultracentrifuged as described above, and the desired proteins were recovered as supernatant, which was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (9.0 cm long, 1.0 cm i.d.), previously equilibrated with the 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1.5 mM CHAPSO, 2 mM DTT and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The eluate was submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis.\n\n### Protein determination\n\nThe protein determination was performed by the Bradford modified method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard (Stoscheck, 1990).\n\n### Detection of the geranyltransferase activity\n\nThe reaction mixture (100 ml) containing 100 mM KPi (pH 8.0), 10 mM of precursors, 10 mM GPP, 10 mM MgCl2 (or MnCl2) and 65 ml of the proteic extract was incubated under stirring for 60 min at 35 degC. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 5 ml of 6 M HCl and extracted with 150 ml of EOAc. After vortex and centrifugation, the organic layer was evaporated, the residue dissolved in MeOH (100 ml) and analysed by HPLC-UV, using a Phenomenex GEMINI(r) column (5 mm C18 110 A, 250 x 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic condition (25 min) consisted of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous HOAc (30%), with detection at 254 and 280 nm. Injection volume: 50 ml. For each reaction, two negative controls, which consisted of: (1) enzymatic extract + buffer and (2) precursor + divalent cation + GPP + buffer, were carried out simultaneously. Each experiment was performed in duplicate.\n\n### Sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)\n\nThe SDS PAGE was performed according to the supplier information (GE Healthcare(r)). The 12% polyacrylamide gels were stained with AgNO3. The relative molecular mass (_M_r) of denatured proteins was estimated using the Lablmage 1D(r) software calibrated with low molecular weight standards (phosphorylase \\(b\\), serialbumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase and trypsin inhibitor, with 97.4, 66.2, 45.0, 31.0, 21.5 and 14.4 kDa, respectively).\n\n### Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE)\n\nThe 2-DE with immobilized pH gradients (IPG-Dalt) was carried out according to the supplier information (GE Healthcare(r)). The IPG strips (13 cm) were rehydrated for 14-18 h with sample proteins previously treated with the Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare(r))\n\n## Page 4\n\nin an Immobiline DryStrip Reswelling Tray. First dimension isoelectric focusing (IEF) was carried out in an Ettan IPCphor II Manifold applying a manufacturer's standard protocol. The second dimension was performed on a vertical (\\(14\\times 16\\) cm) 12% polyacrylamide SDS gel, in a SE 600 Ruby System, 45 mA/gel and 600 V. Each gel was stained with silver according to the Silver Staining Protocol (Amersham Biosciences(r)).\n\n### Inhibition of the protease activity\n\n#### 2.12.1 Reagents\n\nPepsin was from porcine gastric mucous. Recombinant Type VIII Subtilisin Carlsberg, Arg-Glu-(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln-Lys-(DABCYL)-Arg fluorogenic substrate (EDANS-DABCYL) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) spectrophotometric grade, were from Sigma-Aldrich, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n#### 2.12.2 Protease activity assay\n\nThe assays were performed in triplicate. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) for subtilisin and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.4) for pepsin, respectively. Warfarin and dicouamod were used as positive controls (Thaisiromgs et al., 1994; Pochet et al., 2000). Samples and standard inhibitors (1 mg/ml) were pre-incubated with subtilisin (37 nM) or pepsin (1.7 nM) for 1 h, and then transferred to a black opaque microplate to be tested. The substrate EDANS-DABCYL (2 mM) was prepared in the specific buffer for each protease. In the control assay only protease and substrate were used. Proteases were prepared in the day of the experiment and the tests were performed for each one separately. Readings were made using 360 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission) filters during 7 min, with 1 min intervals, at 37 degC (Hirata et al., 2005). The fluorescence intensity was used to calculate the % of inhibition as follows:\n\n\\[\\% I = 100 - \\left[ \\left( \\Delta\\text{Fs}/\\Delta\\text{Fp} \\right) \\ast 100 \\right]\\]\n\nwhere, \\(\\Delta\\text{Fs}\\) and \\(\\Delta\\text{Fp}\\) are the difference between the first and last readings for the sample test and the control, respectively.\n\nFluorescence bioassay data were collected with a multidetection microplate reader Synergy(tm) HT and analysed using the KCA software (Bio-Tek(r) Instruments, Inc.) and Microsoft Windows XP(r).\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\nPrenylation is a chemical or enzymatic addition of a hydrophobic side chain to an accepting molecule (another terpenoid molecule, an aromatic compound, a protein, etc.). In particular, the prenylation of aromatic secondary metabolites plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of a wide range of molecules exerting valuable pharmacological effects. Several examples can be found in phylogenetically different classes of living organisms, from bacteria across mammals to plants (Epifano et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nstudied partially due to their wide occurrence and biomass availability (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex).\n\nAmong _Piper_ genus, 44 species were subjected to photochemical or bioactivity investigations, being _P. cubeba_ the most intensively studied with near 8%, followed by _P. longum_ and _P. aduncum_ with 7%, _P. methystcium_ and _P. tubercultum_ with 6%, _P. sanctum, P. nigrum and _P. crassinevium_ with 5% (Fig. 1). Only nine studies with _Peperoma_ species were found, with _P. duclouxii_ (28%), _P. dindygulensis_ (18%) and _P. galioides_ (13%), being the three mentioned most frequently.\n\nConsidering the type of compounds, they were grouped based on their structural characteristics, as follows: ALK (alkaloids and other substances bearing nitrogen), LG (ligmans, neoligans and related compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPRP (preparlated benzopyrans), HQPR (preparlated hydroquinones), BPR (preparlated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (flavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopytrans), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (steroids), CHX (cyclohexanic derivatives), KLN (kavalacotones, pyrones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives), (Fig. 2A). Their distribution shows the prevalence of nitrogenated substances (ALK), ligands (LG) and flavonoids (FLV) in _Piper_ species. Nevertheless some differences could be observed in _Peperomia_, where LG (lignoids) and BPPR (preplated benzopyrans) were the most abundant (Fig. 2A).\n\nRegarding biological activities, the grouping was performed considering the biological target in order to simplify as follows: **snc** (involving activities related to central nervous system, such as sedative and relaxant), **tryp** (antiprotozaol activity against _Tympanosoma_, _Plasmodium_, _Leishmania_), **cyt** (cytotoxicity and related activities), **atb** (anticmicropholi, such as antibacterial and antifungal), **can** (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more specifically targeted), **insec** (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti-mosquito or ant), **aox** (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), **enz** (inhibitory activity against several enzymes), **aai** (anti-inflammatory activity), **acoa** (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), **iger** (allelophatic activity), **photo** (photo-protecting activity), **cic** (cicatrizing activity) and **avir** (antiviral activity). The obtained distribution shows that _Piper_ genus is mostly related to antibacterial and antiprotozaol activities, followed by anti-inflammatory and enzymatic inhibitory activities, while _Peperomia_ appears to be mostly related to cytotoxic and antiprotozaol activities. Only _Pothomorph_ genus showed some relationship with antiviral activity (Fig. 2B).\n\nFig. 2.: (A) Distribution by type of bioactive compounds reported by genera in Piperaceae family, ALK (substances bearing nitrogen at the molecule), LG (ligmans, neoligans and related compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPPR (preprylated benzopyrans), HQPR (preparlated hydroquinones), BPR (preprylated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (flavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopyrans), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (cytochastic derivatives), KLN (kavalacotones, pyrones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives). (B) Distribution observed by biological activity groups for each genus reported: **snc** (related to central nervous system, such as sedative and relaxant), **tryp** (antiprotozaol activity against _Tympanosoma_, _Plasmodium_, **civ** (cytotoxicity and related), **atb** (anticmicropholi, such as antibacterial and antifungal), **can** (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more specifically targeted), **insec** (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti-mosquito or ant), **aox** (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), **enz** (inhibitory activity against several enzymes), **aai** (antiinflammatory activity), **acoa** (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), **iger** (allelophatic activity), **photo** (photo-protecting activity), **cic** (cicatrizing activity) and **avir** (antiviral activity). The obtained distribution shows that _Piper_ genus is mostly related to antibacterial and antiprotozaol activities, followed by anti-inflammatory and enzymatic inhibitory activities, while _Peperomia_ appears to be mostly related to cytotoxic and antiprotozaol activities. Only _Pothomorph_ genus showed some relationship with antiviral activity (Fig. 2B).\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nAbout preplated natural products, i.e., all the compounds bearing one or more prepally, geranyl, farnesyl or geranyl/ary moieties as substituents in their basic structures, open or cycled (BP, BPR, BPR and HQPR), they could be found in _Preperomia_, _Pothornorph_ and in _Piper_ species (Fig. 2). In addition, they are mostly related to antimicrobial (**arb**), insecticidal (**insec**) and antioxidant activity (**aox**), being the prenylated benzoic acid derivatives (BPR) from _Piper_ species, the group with the most biological activities reported (Fig. 3).\n\nThe analysis for the occurrence of major secondary compounds pointed out that _Piper_ species could be considered as an important source of prenylated compounds and thus a source for further studies of prenyltransferase activity. The two species _P. crassinevium_ and _P. aduncum_ accounted for 11% of the total number of species in which bioactive substances have been reported for this genus and can be considered good candidates for further investigation on bioactive prenylated metabolites (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex).\n\nConsidering the literature survey performed here as well as our previous experience on both bioactivity and biosynthetic studies of prenylated compounds from some _Piper_ species, _P. crassinevium_ was selected for further studies (Lopes et al., 2008). This species accumulates two C-geranylated metabolites derived from benzoic acid [4-hydroxy-3-_E_-(3',7'-dimethyl-1'-_oxo-2',6'-octalenyl)benzoic acid (**1**)] and from 1,4-benzenediol [(1,4-dihydroxy-2',6'-octalenyl)benzene (**2**)], which showed antifungal, antioxidant and trypanacid activities (Fig. 1) (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008).\n\nA screening for the prenylation activity with the crude enzymatic extract from fresh leaves of _P. crassinevium_ plus geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as the prenyl donor, a divalent cation (MgCl2 or MnCl2) and several aromatic substrates (_p_-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, _p_-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phenol, _p_-hydroquinone, caffeic acid, _o_- and _p_-counter acids) was initially performed. Neither the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid nor the _p_-hydroquinone (the two theoretically natural precursors of compounds **1** and **2**) was biotransformed, whilst the reaction with the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid led to the formation of products, as observed in the chromatographic profile, suggesting a biotransformation reaction when compared with that of the negative control. The reaction was consistently reproducible and the product was analysed by HPLC-UV-MS showing an intense peak at _t_R: 13.1 min with _l_max at 280 nm besides some minor compounds between _t_R: 7-9 min (Fig. 4). The fact that the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid could be bio-transformed is interesting because no prenylated natural products bearing a catechol moiety have been isolated from _P. crassinevium_ previously.\n\nThe characterization of the biotransformation products was performed by the analysis of their UV-Vis and MS or tandem MS-MS (ESI negative mode) spectra, as well as by comparison with synthetic compounds prepared for this purpose: the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid geranyl ester (compound **3**), the 4-0-geranyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound **4**) and the 3-0-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound **5**) (Table 1).\n\nRegarding the minor products detected (chromatographic peaks detected at 254 nm with _t_R between 7 and 9 min), their mass (MS) spectra were investigated and compared to those of the synthetic compounds **3**-5. This analysis and the comparison of the chromatographic profiles, UV (_A_max 258 and 295 nm) and MS spectra ([M-H]- = 289, [M-C10H17]- = 153 and [M-C10H17-C02]- = 109) with those of the negative controls (see Section 2.9) allowed the determination of the product eluted at _t_R: 8.6 min as the geranyl ester of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (**3**) (Fig. 4).\n\nThe compound eluted at _t_R: 13.1 min displayed a [M-H]- = 303, which under subsequent fragmentation by MS-MS, gave rise to the fragment ion _m_/_z_ = 259, indicating the loss of a CO2 molecule (Fig. 4). Considering that the addition of one geranyl moiety to this aromatic core produces a molecule with MW = 290, an additional oxidation at the geranylic chain was suggested on the basis of the MW = 304 observed, compatible with additional 14 unites to the MW = 290. This suggestion was based on the observation of the oxidation pattern of the isolated metabolites **1** and **2**, which have a carbonyl carbon at their geranyl moieties (Fig. 1). The position of the geranyl moiety could be proposed as a _C_- (at the aromatic ring) instead of an _O_-substitution (at a phenol group), due to the lack of the fragment at _m_/_z_ = 153 in the MS-MS spectrum (Fig. 4). The position of the oxidation at the geranyl moiety was assumed to be at C-5', due to the observation of the fragment ions at _m_/_z_ = 203 and 159, which could result from a McLafferty-type rearrangement (Fig. 4) (Grossert et al., 2006).\n\nSince plant prenyltransferase are mostly membrane-associated enzymes, an additional protocol on the crude extract was performed to obtain a microsomal fraction (Muhlenwege et al., 1998). The process was monitored by electrophoresis SDS PAGE and 2-DE, and the microsomal fraction was evaluated for its geranyltransferase activity having _p_-hydroquinone, _p_-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids as aromatic acceptors. No products were detected when _p_-hydroquinone and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid were used as substrates. Nevertheless, the analysis indicated that the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid was biotransformed yielding a new product as a weak chromatographic peak (_t_R: 13.6 min), absent in the negative controls. The chromatographic profile of the obtained product was compared with those of the endogenous (**1**) and synthetic (**6** and **7**, Table 2) compounds, suggesting that the product of this biotransformation could be an 0-geranylated derivative (Fig. 5).\n\nPrevious studies carried out by our research group with leaves of _P. crassinevium_ have demonstrated that compounds **1** and **2** were biosynthesized _de novo_ after incubation for three days with glucose (unpublished results). Consequently, a protocol of feeding glucose by pre-incubation of fresh leaves from _P. crassinevium_ with a 10% aqueous solution was applied to enhance the expression of the geranyltransferase activity.\n\nSubsequent to the enzymatic reaction, the synthesis of the expected product was enhanced, being possible to identify it as the geranyl geranyl ester of the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid **6** both in the crude extract and in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 5). This result is\n\nFig. 3: Distribution of prenylated bioactive metabolites by genera within Piperaceae family.

Nevertheless, from the analysis of the spectral data of the product\n\nFig. 4: Typical chromatogram obtained for the biotransformation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, using GPP and the crude enzymatic extract from the leaves of _P_-_crasinerurum_, which shows the product identified as compound **3** at \\(t\\)2; 8.6 min, and the proposed fragmentation pattern of the product eluted at \\(t\\)2; 13.1 min, based on the analysis of its MS and tandem MS-MS.

Chromatographic conditions: ACN–HOAc 0.1% (70:30), 1 ml/min, inj., vol. 50 ul, 25 min, detection: UV _λ_ = 280 nm, ESI negative mode – 30 V.\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\nobtained and characterized by Haagena et al. (2007), we propose that it is the ester derivative instead of the ether, as reported. The expected chemical shift value for the CH2-1' at \\(d\\) observed in the 1H NMR, should be similar for the two derivatives **6** and **7** and, therefore this data should not be enough to distinguish which derivative was formed. Thus, further NMR experiments including analysis of the 13C NMR values and the _g_HMBC correlations were carried out.\n\nThe observed differences in the substrate specificity, suggest the presence of, at least, two geranyltransferases in _P.__cassinevium_. One of them was soluble and showed affinity to the 3.4-dihy-droxybenzoic acid, while the second was concentrated in the microsomal fraction, recognizing the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid as substrate and was inducible by glucose. The SDS PAGE and 2-DE analysis indicated the concentration of spots between pl 6-7 and 56-58 kDa in the microsomal fraction, which is in agreement with previous reports for geranyltransferases from plants (Fig. 6).\n\nThe two enzymatically formed products were characterized as _O_-geranylated derivatives and were previously reported as synthetic compounds (Kubo et al., 2003). The production of esters instead of ethers or C-prenylated derivatives, as naturally occurs in plants, suggests that different conditions and environments could affect the prenylation outcome in crude and partly purified enzymatic extracts. Besides, a C-geranylated derivative of the 3.4-dihy-droxybenzoic acid bearing a carbonyl group at C-5' could be proposed by the analysis of its MS-MS fragmentation data.

The inhibition of viral proteases has indeed been demonstrated to be a good target to search new drugs for the treatment of several illnesses including AIDS. In this context, the investigation on some common proteases such as subtilisin and pepsin is considered as a useful screening for the discovery of potential inhibitors of retroviral proteases (Hirata et al., 2005). Compounds **3** and **6** were tested as inhibitors of subtilisin and pepsin using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology. Both compounds showed weak activity, being the ester **6** slightly more active than **3** showing 15% of inhibition at 1 mg/ml on pepsin and 14% on subtilisin (Table 3). Warfarin and dicomumoral were tested as positive controls. The HIV-like protease inhibitory potential reported for **3** and **6** is the first approach to the determination of antiviral activity of this kind of compounds, and complements the range of biological activities previously reported, such as antifungal and antibacterial (Kubo et al., 2003; Nihei et al., 2004).\n\n## 4 Conclusions\n\nPrenylation of aromatic compounds represents an important feature when the formation of bioactive compounds in plants is concerned. There are several examples in which different simple prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl, geranylgeranyl or polytergenic unities are added to aromatic substrates rendering them with important biological properties. The literature survey indicated that among Piperaceae family, _P. crassinervium_ species appeared as an important source of geranyltransferase activity looking at biotransformations reactions. Between the two substrates evaluated, the p-hydroxybenzoic acid was O-geranylated, whilst the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was both C- and O-geranylated. The 0-geranylated products presented a weak protease inhibitory activity. The electrophoretic analysis performed on the microsomal fraction showed a typical prenyltransferase electrophoretic profile (Mr 56-58 kDa, pl 6-7).\n\nThis work contributes to the comprehensive study of biotransformation reactions with geranyl moieties using plant enzymatic extracts as an alternative strategy to the biocatalysis with purified enzymes.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Prof. Wagner Vilegas and Dr. Alberto C.

Their IR spectra revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (1466, 1690 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** (Table 1) showed two aromatic signals, one at \\(\\delta\\) 6.87 (1H, _s_) and the other at \\(\\delta\\) 6.43 (1H, _s_), suggesting a tetra-substituted aromatic spin-system with a _para_ configuration. A series of complex signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.76 (1H, _m_) 3.35 (4H, _m_); \\(\\delta\\) 3.04 (1H, _m_) and \\(\\delta\\) 2.30 (1H, _m_) were indicative of two carbonic and two benzyl hydrogens, respectively. Further signals at \\(\\delta\\) 0.51 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 1.03 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 2.05 (3H, _s_) revealed the presence of two aliphatic and one aromatic methyl groups in the molecule.\n\nThe 13C NMR chemical shifts for **1** along with the information obtained from a DEPT-135 experiment (Table 1), indicated a total of 15 signals, suggesting a sesquiterpene: six aromatic carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 152.9 (_s_), 141.1 (_s_), 128.1 (_d_), 127.4 (_s_), 121.9 (_s_) and 114.7 (_d_), confirming the tetra-substitution for the aromatic moiety and the _para_ hydrogen system; two carbonic signals: a methine at \\(\\delta\\) 67.8 and a methylene at \\(\\delta\\) 64.4; three signals for methines at \\(\\delta\\) 40.1, 38.4 and 36.5; one aliphatic methylene at \\(\\delta\\) 24.6 and three signals for methyl groups: \\(\\delta\\) 16.7, 15.9 and 10.8. The above data suggested a caldinane skeleton (Zhang et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 1996). The total attribution for the observed signals was accomplished based on gHMQC correlations.\n\nAdditional gHMBC correlations of H-5 (\\(\\delta\\) 6.87) with C-15 and C-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 15.9 and \\(\\delta\\) 36.5, respectively) and H-2 (\\(\\delta\\) 6.43) with C-10 and C-4 (\\(\\delta\\) 40.1 and \\(\\delta\\) 121.9) allowed us to fully determine the aromatic moiety. The phenolic function linked at C-3, was supported by the correlations between H-15 (\\(\\delta\\) 2.05) and C-3/C-5 (\\(\\delta\\) 152.9 and \\(\\delta\\) 128.1, respectively). The linkage of the _p_-methane moiety was determined through the correlations shown by C-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 141.1) with H-14/H-9 (\\(\\delta\\) 1.03/\\(\\delta\\) 3.76) and C-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 127.4) with, H-11/H-8\\(\\delta\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 2.70/\\(\\delta\\) 1.52). Observed correlations between C-12 \\(\\rightarrow\\) H-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 64.4/3.04) and H-13 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 0.51/36.5) allowed us to fully determine the calamenene skeleton (Nagashima et al., 1996).\n\n_g_NOESY was useful to establish the relative configuration of the stereocenters for **1**. A correlations between Me-14 and Me-13 confirmed a _cis_-calamenene, according to reported literature (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993). Further observed correlations between H-9a and H-7 allowed us to confirm a (_cis_)-1,3-_pseudo_-diaxial relationship between these centers (Nabeta et al., 1993). We were not able to determine the configuration of the stereocenter at C-11, due to free rotation of this center with C-7-C-11 bond. Compound **1** was thus identified as the rel. (\\(-\\))-(7S,9S,10S)-3,9,12-trihydroxycalamenene.\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H22O3 ([M + H-H2O]\\({}^{+}\\)) at _m_/_z_ 233.1542. The obtained mass and similarities observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) indicated that **2** was a diastereoisomer of **1**. The main spectroscopic differences observed for this molecule were elucidated by using gNOESY. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 indicated that both groups remained in a _cis_ conformation. The appearance of a strong correlation of Me-14 and H-9 indicated that H-7 and H-9 were in a _trans_ conformation. Further comparisons with reported data (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c c} No. & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** & \\\\ \\hline \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C & \\(\\delta\\)H & \\(\\delta\\)C \\\\ \\hline\n1 & & 141.1 & & 139.0 & & 142.1 & & 134.7 & & 1\n\n## Page 3\n\net al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993) allowed us to provisionally deduce identify **2** as rel. (+)-(75,9\\(R\\), 10S) the C-9 diastereo-isomer of **1.**\n\nCompound **3** was isolated as a white amorphous powder. HRESI mass data allowed us to propose the molecular formula C15H22O2 ([M + H]+ at _m/z_ 235.1777). The absence of an oxygen atom in this molecule allowed us to provisionally deduce that a reduction occurred at position C-9. This reduction was confirmed by 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) due to the presence of the signal at \\(d\\) 28.5 and the lack of the carboxymethine signal at \\(d\\) 67.8/69.1 present in **1** and **2**, respectively.\n\nA correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 was observed in the _g_NOESY experiment thus concluding that **3** has a _cis_ calamenene relative stereochemistry. Observed correlations between H-9a and H-8a and H-7 defined their relative configuration also as _cis_. Further observed correlations between H-8b and H-9b, confirmed the relative configuration established for the _p_-menthane moiety. Compound **3** was hence identified as the rel. (+)-(75,10S) 3,12-dihydroxycalamenene.\n\nCompound **4** was isolated as a white amorphous powder. A molecular formula C15H18O2 ([M + H]+ at _m/z_ 231.1405) was obtained after HRESI mass data analysis. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed a new aromatic hydrogen spin system at \\(d\\) 7.03 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and \\(d\\) 6.93 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) with an _ortho_ configuration. The downfield shift observed for Me-14 (_t_  1.3) was indicative of an aromatization of the _p_-menthane moiety (Nabeta et al., 1994). 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) data showed 10 aromatic carbons, three methyls: two benzylic _g_HMQC, _g_HMBC, and compared with reported data for cadalene analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975).\n\nFurther correlations observed in the _g_HMBC experiment, particularly the ones of H-8 (_d_ 6.93) with C-6/C-11 and H-9 (_d_ 7.03) with C-1/C-14 allowed us to fully determine the substitution pattern of the B ring for the naphthalene moiety. Compound **4** was identified as 3,12-dihydroxycadalene.\n\nCompound **5** was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H18O3 ([M + Na]+ at _m/z_ 269.1179). The appearance of a hydroxyl group in **5** was corroborated by the loss of the signal assigned to H-11 (_d_ 3.59) in **4** thus suggesting that oxidation had occurred at this position. 13C NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopic data corroborated this assumption showing a signal at \\(d\\) 75.3 (_s_) which exhibited a correlation showed in the _g_HMBC experiment with H-8 (_d_ 7.21) indicating that the new oxidized position was at C-11. Other correlations were determined using _g_COSY, _g_HMQC, and compared with reported data for analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Compound **5** was identified as the new 3,11,12-trihydroxycadalene.\n\nThe antifungal activity of compounds **1**-**5** against the phytopathogenic fungi _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ was evaluated by bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). The compound 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (**2**) exhibited potent activity against two fungi. The detection limit for the compound **5** was found to be 1.0 mg, comparable with the same amount of the standard nystatin.\n\nCytotoxicity of the compounds **1**-**5** against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983). Compound **4** exhibited\n\n## Page 4\n\ncytotoxicity against cell line (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 20 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{-1}\\)), and **3** and **5** a weak cytotoxicity (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 100 and 110 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{-1}\\), respectively). Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC\\({}_{50}\\) 5 \\(\\mu\\)mol L\\({}^{-1}\\).\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedure\n\nOptical rotations were determined at room temperature using Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer and Perkin-Elmer UV-Vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on Microquimica MQAPF-301. \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra; _g_HMBC and _g_HMQC, _g_COSY and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive and negative ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-resolution orthogonal time of flight (o-TOF) configuration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 \\(\\mu\\)ml/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH-H\\({}_{2}\\)O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using a ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/ MS spectra of mass selected ions were acquired using 10-20 eV collisions with argon. For preparative HPLC separations, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, and a Phenyl-hexyl Luna Phenomenex column, (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 \\(\\mu\\)m), were used in this study. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromato-integrator connected to a UV detector.\n\nTLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisal-dehyde 5% in H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) followed by heating.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _C. spectabilis_ plant material was collected in the Chemistry Institute UNESP - Aranaquara, SP, Brazil in June 17, 2001 by G.H. Silva. The botanical identification was made by Professor Maria Claudia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SILVA - 193).\n\n### Isolation of the endophytic fungus\n\nThe fungal strain _P. cassiae_ was an endophyte isolated from leaves of _C. spectabilis_. The leaves were washed in running H\\({}_{2}\\)O and surface sterilized by successive soaking in NaOCl 1% for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 1 min and then rinsed twice with water. Aseptically the leaves were cut open and 1 x 1 cm\\({}^{2}\\) pieces of the leaves were placed on water agar in Petri plates. After incubation at 25 degC for seven days, individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maier et al., 1997). During the first three weeks of incubation, the cultures were periodically checked for purity and successively subcultured by hyphal tipping method until pure culture was obtained. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar. The taxonomic identification as _P. cassiae_ was performed based on fungal morphology by Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited Cole-cao Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lavras fungal herbarium and assigned as CML 292.\n\n### Growth of P. cassiae and production of the EtOAc extract\n\nThe fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 degC for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 x 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the _P. cassiae_ isolated were inoculated into each flask and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 degC on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration. The culture broth was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 2,0 L). The EtOAc extracts were combined, filtered, and evaporated _in vacuo_ to give a yellow oil (277.12 mg).\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\nThe microorganisms _C. cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and _C. sphareospermum_ (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds **1**-**5** were applied on a precoated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 \\(\\mu\\)L) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 \\(\\mu\\)g. After eluting with CHCl\\({}_{3}\\):CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control.\n\n### Cytotoxicity bioassays\n\nThe human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described (Mosmann, 1983). Cisplatin was used as positive control (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 5.0 mmol L\\({}^{-1}\\)).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe extract was subjected to C18 column chromatography employing gradient elution from H\\({}_{2}\\)O to MeOH, to yield 7 fractions (H\\({}_{2}\\)O:MeOH, 85:15, 65:35, 60:40, 55:45, 45:55, 35:65, 00:100 each 150 mL). \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectroscopic analyses identified fractions 3, 4 and 5 as promising \n\n## Page 5\n\nfor further fractionation. The fraction 3 (23.0 mg) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 mm, Phenomenex 21.20 x 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (19:81) as the solvent, flow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to afford sesquiterpene **1** (3.5 mg). Fraction 4 (15.0 mg) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 mm, Phenomenex 21.20 x 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (22:78) as the solvent, flow rate 10 mL/min, UV detection at 248 nm] to afford sesquiterpenes **2** (2.5 mg) and **4** (4.0 mg). Fraction 5 (30.0 mg) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 mm, Phenomenex 21.20 x 250 mm] using CH3CN:H2O (29:71) as the solvent, flow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to afford sesquiterpenes **3** (4.0 mg) and **5** (4.8 mg).\n\n#### 3.7.1 Rel.

The MeOH extract of leaves of _Iryanthera juruensis_, one of the plants endemic to the Amazon region and consumed in Brazil, and the hexane extract from its seeds inhibited lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2)) enzymes in in vitro assays. Further analyses of these extracts yielded 5-deoxyflavones (**1**-**5**) from the leaf extract and sargachromenol (**6**), sargaquinoic acid (**7**), a novel juruenoic acid (**8**), _o_-aryalkanoic acids (**9a**-**c**), and the lignan guaiacin (**10**) from the seed extract.

However, compounds **7** and **8** were inactive and lignan **10** exhibited LPO inhibitory activity by 99% at 100 ppm compared to commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and vitamin E. The flavones **1**-**5** also inhibited COX-1 and -2 enzymes by 50-65% at 100 ppm. Compound **6** showed high but nonselective inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, when compared to aspirin and Celebrex, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Compounds **7** and **10** inhibited COX-1 by 60% and 65% and COX-2 by 37% and 18%, respectively, whereas compounds **8** and **9a**-**c** showed little or no activity against these enzymes.\n\n**Keywords:** _Iryanthera juruensis_; Myristicaceae; lipid peroxidation; cyclooxygenase; flavone; tocotrienol; o-aryalkanoic acids; lignan\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nPlants from Myristicaceae family have been traditionally used as food supplements by South American Indians. The anecdotal health benefits of these plants are implicated in healing stomach infections and wounds and for inducing central nervous system (CNS) alterations when used during religious ceremonies. The _Iryanthera_ species are endemic to the Amazon region and their crushed leaves were reported to heal infected wounds and cuts. Also, the latex from the parks, mixed with warm water, was used for treating infections (_1_). The seeds of _Iryanthera_ species are valued in Brazil for their high yield in fatty acids, which also explains their general designation as \"ucu-uba\", or fat-producing tree. The protein-rich air and roasted seeds as well as beverages prepared from the crushed leaves of _Iryanthera_ are consumed by native people in the Amazon region. The major constituent in the seeds of _Iryanthera_ species is myristic acid, a C14 fatty acid. It usually co-occurs with antioxidant toci-triends and is extensively used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries (_2_). In the course of our systematic studies on _Iryanthera_ species, we have demonstrated the presence of antioxidant tocientionds, flavonoids, and flavonoligans in fruits and leaves of _Iryanthera grandis_, _Iryanthera lancifolia, Iryanthera saggiana_, and _Iryanthera juruensis_ (_3_-_7_).\n\nOxidative damage to the cell membrane and its components is the initial event in several human disease processes, including cancer and atherosclerosis. _Iryanthera_ spp. are known for their health benefits and hence we have continued the search for natural antioxidants in this plant species. It is a popular notion that regular consumption of antioxidant compounds imparts beneficial effects to biological systems and that such compounds act as chemopreventive agents. It has been established that compounds with radical scavenging activity are beneficial to health since they induce detoxifying enzymes (_8_, _9_).\n\nAs part of ongoing projects aimed at the discovery of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora [Biota-FAPESP (www.biotasp.org.br) and BIOprospecTA (www.bioprospecta.org.br), the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of 56 plant extracts have been examined by means of in vitro assays measuring the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and\n\n## Page 2\n\ncyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, respectively. The methanol and hexane extracts of _I. juruensis_ leaves and seeds, respectively, were subjected to bioassay-directed chromatographic purification. This paper presents the comparative LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities of the pure isolates and of crude extracts along with commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxynisole (BHA), and vitamin E, as well as clinically used antiinflammatory agents aspirin and Celebrex. Also, this is the first report of flavones **1-5** from _I. juruensis_ and of the novel juruenolic acid (**8**).\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### General Experimental Procedures\n\nUV and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B and a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1750 spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR spectra [\\({}^{\\text{H}}_{\\text{i}}\\), \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\), correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiments] were measured on Varian NOVA (300 MHz) and VPK (500 MHz) instruments. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to residual proton signals of CDCl3 at 7.24 and DMSO-_d_d_d at 2.50. Coupling constants, \\(J\\), are in Hertz. \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\) NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to residual \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\) signals of CDCl3 at 77.0 and DMSO-_d_d_d at 39.5. Standard pulse sequences were employed for all 1D [\\({}^{\\text{H}}_{\\text{i}}\\), \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\), and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)] and 2D (COSY, HMBC, and HMQC) NMR experiments. Mass spectra were recorded at the Michigan State University mass spectrometry facility on a JEOL HX-110 double-focusing mass spectrometer (Peabody, MA) operating in the positive ion mode for fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and high-resolution (HR) FABMS experiments.\n\nMerck silica gel (60 mesh size, 35-70 \\(\\mu\\)m) with particle size of 60 \\(\\mu\\)m was used for preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). For preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation, 250, 500, and 1000 \\(\\mu\\)m silica gel plates (Analtech, Inc., Newark, DE) were used. TLC plates were viewed under UV light at 254 and 366 nm or sprayed with 10% sulfuric acid solution.\n\nSolvents were of ACS reagent grade and were purchased from Spectrum Chemical Co. (Gardena, CA). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxylosynisole (BHA), a-tocopherol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Celebrex was a physician professional sample. 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-_sn_-glycerol-3-phosphocholine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and 3-[_p_(6-6phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatriyl]phenylpropionic acid was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were prepared in the Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals Laboratory (BSNP) from ram seminal vesicles and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2), from cloned insect cell lysate, respectively (12).\n\n### Plant Material and Extract Preparation\n\nLeaves and fruits of _I. juruensis_ were collected in Reserva do Mocampo, in the Amazon forest in January during the rainy season, and identified as _Iryanthera juruensis_ Warburg by botanist Nelson Rosa. A voucher specimen, ID 141860 MG, was deposited at the Herbrahim Joho Mura Pires at Museu Paranes Emilio Goedi (Belem, PA, Brazil). The dried and ground leaves (111 g) and seeds (53 g) were extracted separately with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol at room temperature, using 3 x 300 mL of each solvent for extraction of leaves and 3 x 130 mL of each solvent for extraction of seeds. Solvents were removed under vacuum by use of a rotary evaporator and afforded the crude extracts hexane (1.4 g), EtOAc (1.8 g), and MeOH (6.4 g) from leaves and hexane (13.5 g), EtOAc (14.1 g), and MeOH (3.3 g) from seeds.\n\n### Isolation of Constituents\n\nThe MeOH extract from the leaves of _I. juruensis_ (3.2 g) was stirred with CHCl3 and filtered to remove the precipitate (1.5 g). The CHCl3-soluble part of this extract was concentrated (1.7 g) and subjected to HPLC on silica gel. Euliton with hexane-acetone (H/A) solvent system under gradient conditions (H/B 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL; H/A 2:4, 200 mL; each; A/A 300 mL; A/A 3:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL; A/A 300 mL; A/A 3:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:2, 300 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL; A/A 300 mL; A/A 3:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:\n\n## Page 3\n\nextrusion (29 times) through a 100 nm pore size membrane. The final assay volume was 2 mL, consisting of 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of \\(N\\)-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-\\(N\\)-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer [50 mM HEPES and 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Trisi)], 200 \\(\\mu\\)L of 1 M NaCl, 1.64 mL of N2-spraged Millipore purified water, 20 \\(\\mu\\)L of test sample or DMSO (solvent control), and a 20-\\(\\mu\\)L aliquot of liposome suspension. Peroxidation was initiated by addition of 20 \\(\\mu\\)L of FcCl2* 4H2O (0.5 mM) to achieve a final concentration of 50 \\(\\mu\\)M Fe2+. The positive controls BHA, BHT, and co-tocopherol/vitamin E were tested at a final concentration of 10 \\(\\mu\\)M. Fluorescence was measured at 384 nm and monitored at 0, 1, and 3 min and every 3 min thereafter up to 21 min on a Turner model 450 digital fluorometer (Barnsstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA). The decrease of relative fluorescence intensity with time indicated the rate of peroxidation. Relative fluorescence (\\(F_{t}\\)/\\(F_{0}\\)) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence value at a given time \\(t\\) (\\(F_{t}\\)) by that at \\(t=0\\) min (\\(F_{0}\\)).\n\n_Cyclooxygenase Enzymes Inhibitory Assay._ COX-1 enzyme inhibitory assay was conducted with an enzyme preparation from ram seminal vesicles (ca. 0.46 mg of protein/mL in 30 mM Tris buffer, pH 7). COX-2 activity was determined by using a preparation from insect cell lysate and diluting with Tris buffer (pH 7) to give an approximate final concentration of 1.5 mg protein/mL (_12, 13_). COX assays were measured at 37 oC by observing the initial rate of O2 uptake with a micro oxygen chamber and electrode (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) attached to a YSI model 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instrument, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Each assay mix contained 0.6 mL of 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7), 1 mmol of phenol, and 17 \\(\\mu\\)g of hemoglobin. For each test compound (100 ppm) or standards in DMSO (10 \\(\\mu\\)L), activities were determined following a 2-10 min preincubation of samples with enzyme COX-1 or COX-2 (10-20 \\(\\mu\\)L) in the assay chamber. Celebrex (1.7 ppm) and aspirin (108 ppm) were used as positive controls in this assay. Different concentrations of standards used were due to their difference in inhibitory activities and also to achieve a uniform enzyme inhibition at 50%. Reaction was initiated by adding arachidonic acid (10 \\(\\mu\\)L of a 1.64 \\(\\mu\\)M solution). Data were recorded with Quicklog for Windows data acquisition software (Strawberry Tree Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have evaluated 158 Brazilian plant extracts by TLC for the presence of antioxidant compounds (unpublished data) by spraying the developed TLC plates with \\(\\beta\\)-carotene solution followed by exposure to natural light (_10_). The results indicated the presence of antioxidants in 56 extracts, based on the observation of persistent yellow spots after exposure of the plates to natural light (_10_). These 56 plant extracts were then evaluated for their LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities. On the basis of the bioassay results, the methanol and hexane extracts of _I. jurvenis_ leaves and seeds, respectively, were selected for the isolation of bioactive compounds. In summary, the chromatographic purification of the leaf-extract afforded 5-deoxy-flavones (**1\\(-\\)5**) and the seeds extract gave sargachromenol (**6**), sargaquinoic acid (**7**), the novel juruenoic acid (**8**), \\(\\omega\\)-aryalkanoic acids (**9a\\(-\\)c**), and guaiaacin (**10**).\n\nThe identification of isolates was based mostly on NMR, UV, and MS spectral analysis and comparison with literature data. Compounds **1\\(-\\)5** belonged to the class of flavones lacking a 5-oxy substituent, which was confirmed by the signal at ca. \\(\\delta\\) 7.90 (d, \\(J\\sim 8.0\\) Hz), assigned to H-5, in their \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra. The position of -OCH3 groups in flavones **3** and **4** was established by UV spectral analysis with NaOAc/MeOH and NaOMe/MeOH as shift reagents for determination of the substitution patterns in rings A (band I) and B (band II), respectively (_14, 15_). Also, the NMR data of these compounds were identical to the reported chemical shift values and further confirmed their identities. Therefore, compound **1** was identified as 7,4 -dimethoxyflavone and was formerly isolated from _Virola_, a widely occurring neotropical Myristicaceae genus (_16_), whereas compound **3** was identified as tithonine, previously isolated from _Tithonia_ (Asteraceae) (_17_). Compounds **2** and **4**, identified as fasciculiferin and farnisine, respectively, were reported from _Acacia fasciculifera_ and _Acacia farnesiana_ (Fabaceae) (_18, 19_). Similarly, compound **5** was identified as 7,4 -dihydroxyflavone, reported from _Pterocarpus marsupium_ (_20_).\n\nThe structures of sargachromenol (**6**) and sargaquinoic acid (**7**) were also confirmed by NMR and MS spectral analyses. These compounds have been isolated earlier from brown seaweeds from the genera _Sargassum_ and _Stipopodium_ (_21, 22_) and as repeated isolates from _I. jurvenis_ (_7_).\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum of compound **8** showed signals for four methyl groups on sp2 carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 1.59, 1.62, 1.68, and 2.13, which showed correlations to signals at \\(\\delta\\) 17.7, 15.8, 25.6, and 29.9, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. A triplet at \\(\\delta\\) 5.98, integrated for one proton, and a multiplet at \\(\\delta\\) 5.09 for two protons were observed in its \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR signal at \\(\\delta\\) 172.0, assigned to an a,\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carboxyl, and at \\(\\delta\\) 123.0, 130.0, 132.0, 135.0, and 145.6, assigned to olefinic carbons of an isoprene chain, suggested a partial structure similar to the side chain in compounds **6** and **7**. An\n\n## Page 4\n\nadditional signal at d 208.0, which showed HMBC correlation with the singlet at d 2.13 and the triplet at d 2.45, indicated a methyl-carbonyl-methylene moiety in the structure of **8** (**Figure 1**). Also, one quartet at d 2.60, two triplets at d 2.08 and 2.11, integrated for two protons each, and one multiplet at d 2.26, integrated for four protons, were assigned to the allyl-methylene protons. The HMBC correlation between H1 (d 2.26) and C1 (COOH, d 172.6), in addition to correlations of H8 (d 2.27) to C6 (d 130.6) and to C10 (C=O, d 208.8) indicated the position of -COOH moiety at C2. Additional COSY (**Figure 2**) and HMBC correlations led to the complete assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR signals (**Table 1**). HRFABMS and FABMS analysis showed peaks at 293.2116 [M + H+] and 585 [2M + H+], respectively, which confirmed the molecular formula as C18H2O3, whereas peaks at _m/z_ 69 and 165 in the FAB mass spectrum (positive ion mode) were assigned to the isopentemly (C6H9) moiety and to the ion resulting from the loss of isopentyl and carboxyl moieties [M - C3H9 - COOH]+, respectively. Therefore, the spectral data gave conclusive support to the establishment of the structure of the new compound **8** as 2-(4-methylpentyl-3)-10-oxonadecan-2,6-dienoic acid.\n\n_o_-Arylalkanoic acids **9a-c** were identified on the basis of their UV, 1H and 13C NMR, and FABMS spectra and are probably biosynthetic precursors of g-lactones known as jurue-nolides, which occur widely in _Iryanthera_ species (_7_, _23_). Compound **10** was identified from its spectroscopic data and by comparison with literature values as guaiacin, an aryltetralin lignan, previously isolated from _Guaicanum officinale_ (Zygophylplaceae) (_24_, _25_).\n\nFlavonoids are by far the most investigated class of natural products regarding antioxidant properties. The aromatic -OH groups and the C2\\(-\\)C3 double bond are some of the features of flavonoids important for their antioxidant activity (_26_). Flavones **3-5** showed lipoperoxidation inhibition by 95% when tested at 100 ppm. At lower concentration (10 ppm), they were still highly active (**Figure 3**) and inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88%, respectively. This suggested that flavones **3-5** offer better protection of lipid membranes from oxidation than sargachromenol (**6**) or sargaunoioic acid (**7**).\n\nFlavones **1-5** also showed moderate inhibition of COX enzymes. However, the COX-1 enzyme was inhibited the most, by 40\\(-\\)65%, compared to COX-2 enzyme (**Figure 4**). At 100 ppm, flavones **1** and **2** inhibited COX-2 enzyme by 31% and 51%, respectively, whereas flavones **3-5** showed <20% inhibition. This activity profile might be dependent on their polarity as well as the substitution pattern in ring B. For example, flavones **1** and **2** are fully methylated compounds, whereas compounds **3-5** contained free -OH groups in their structures. Moreover, the substitution pattern in ring B seemed to play a major role in determining the COX-2 enzyme activity, as the presence of a 3, 4-dimethoxy ring B rendered the highest enzyme inhibitory activity among flavones **1-5** tested. Also, lack of a methoxy group in ring B led to a reduction in the activity as shown by flavone **5**. The presence of either a 7-OMe or 7-OH group in ring A seemed to be of lesser impact on COX-2 inhibition as shown by compounds **3** and **4**, which showed similar activities.\n\nIn previous studies, sargachromenol (**6**) was shown to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties that were assessed by electrochemical studies, by reaction with the stable free radical DPPH, and by inhibition of TPA-induced mouse ear edema (_7_, _27_). In this paper, we present additional support of the biological activity of _I. juruensis_ by demonstrating the ability of its isolates to inhibit LPO (76% at 100 ppm) (**Figure 3**) and COX-1 (98%) and COX-2 (84%) enzymes (**Figure 4**). In contrast, plastoquinone 7 exhibited poor inhibitory activities of LPO and COX-1 and -2 enzymes. This was probably due to\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} position & d0_μ_b_c_c_c_c_ & HMBC & HMOOCOSY \\\\\n1 & & 172.6 s & \\\\\n2 & & 135.5 s & \\\\\n3 & 5.981 (7.5) & 145.34 & C-5, C-2, C-1 & H-8 \\\\\n4 & 2.80 (7.5) & 28.11 t & C-6, C-5, C-3, C-2 & H-3, H-3 \\\\\n5 & 2.081 (7.5) & 39.0 t & C-7, C-4, C-3, C-2, C-12 & H-7, H-4 \\\\\n6 & & 130.6 s & & \\\\\n\n## Page 5\n\nthe lack of aromatic hydroxyls in its molecule and/or its oxidizing features associated with the quinone moiety. Poor inhibitory activities toward COX-1 and -2 enzymes were also observed for compounds **8** and **9**. In contrast, arylkalanoic acid **9** inhibited LPO by 79%, whereas compound **8** showed much lower ability to protect liposomes from oxidation (**Figure 3b**). Guaiacin (**10**) presented the highest LPO inhibitory activity (>95% at 100 ppm) among the tested compounds from _I. jurwensis_ fruits. This was probably due to the presence of two veratryl moieties in its structure, which may increase the hydrogen radical donating ability of the aromatic hydroxyl groups. It also strongly inhibited COX-1 (75% at 100 ppm) enzyme but showed weak activity toward COX-2 (<20% at 100 ppm).\n\nThe findings of our research on _I. jurwensis_ seeds and leaves have clearly shown that the plant parts studied possessed LPO inhibitory activity and were in agreement with the anecdotal reports. In addition, the moderate inhibition of COX-2 enzyme by extracts from seeds and leaves and the isolates from them further suggested the potential health beneficial effects of this plant and validated the ethno uses of _I. jurwensis_ decoction by Amazon Indians.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nWe thank Dr. D.

Ximenes, Mariana G. Lopes, Maicon Segalla Petronio, Luis Octavio Regasin, Dulce H. Siqueira Silva, Luiz M. da Fonseca\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe protective effect of gallic acid and its esters, methyl, propyl, and lauryl gallate, against _2,2'_-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH)-induced hemolysis and depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in erythrocytes was studied. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent, and the esters were significantly more effective than gallic acid. Gallic acid and its esters were compared with regard to their reactivity to free radicals, using the DPPH and AAPH/pyranine free-cell assays, and no significant difference was obtained. Gallic acid and its esters not only failed to inhibit the depletion of intracellular GSH in erythrocytes induced by AAPH but exacerbated it. Similarly, the oxidation of GSH by AAPH or horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in cell-free systems was exacerbated by gallic acid or gallates. This property could be involved in the recent findings on pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidant activities of gallates in tumor cells. We provide evidence that lipophilicity and not only radical scavenger potency is an important factor regarding the efficiency of anti-hemolytic substances.\n\nGallic acid; gallates; erythrocytes; hemolysis; glutathione; peroxyl radical; antioxidant; pro-oxidant activity\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nGallic acid and its derivatives are among the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in wines and green tea (_I_ - _3_). This phytochemical is well-known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and chemopreventive properties (_t_ - _7_). The similar beneficial effects of the synthetic esters of gallic acid have been extensively studied, and in many cases, they are stronger than those of gallic acid itself. For instance, lauryl gallate (dodecyl gallate), a widely used food additive, is more efficient than gallic acid as an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, and of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by FeIII-NADPH (_d_). Methyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid at inhibiting oral bacterial growth and the formation of _Streptococcus mutans_ biofilms (_4_). Methyl gallate inhibits the production of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2 by bone-marrow-derived mast cells (_th_). Nonyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid against the growth of _Salmonella choleraeus_ (_10_). Lauryl gallate protects against the formation of dimethylbenzanthracene-induced skin tumors in mice and kills, selectively, tumor cells in established tumors (_11_). Such biological activities have been correlated with the amphipathic feature of these ester derivatives (_12_), because the _in vitro_ antioxidant potential is nearly the same as that of gallic acid. Hence, it may be supposed that the accessibility of the gallates to the intracellular medium could be a determining factor for their effects.\n\nAnother relevant property of gallates is their pro-oxidant characteristics. Indeed, the cytotoxic effect of octyl, dodecyl, and tetracdexy gallates on melanoma cells has recently been demonstrated (_13, 14_). This biological effect has been associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of NF-_k_B, inhibition of cell adhesion, and alteration of the cell redox status by depletion of both glutathione (GSH) and ATP (_13_). Similarly, the inhibition of HeLa cell growth by propyl gallate was associated with depletion of intracellular GSH and increased production of the superoxide anion (_14_).\n\nThe hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an _ex vivo_ model for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced disruption of cell membranes and the protective effect of antioxidants. One of the most frequently studied models uses the water-soluble azo compound 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), which decomposes at physiological temperature (37 degC)\n\n## Page 2\n\nto generate an alkyl radical (R*). In the presence of dissolved molecular oxygen, this radical is converted to the corresponding peroxyl radical (ROO*) (_15_). The mechanism of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by thermolysis of AAPH is not completely understood, but it has been correlated with lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins (_16_). The incubation of erythrocytes with AAPH also provokes the depletion of intracellular GSH (_17_).\n\nBecause the above biological phenomenon is associated with the disruption of the cell membrane and in view of increasing evidence that the lipophilicity of gallic acid esters is decisive for their beneficial effects, here, we aimed to synthesize selected gallate esters and compare their efficacy as inhibitors of AAPH-induced hemolysis and GSH depletion. The objective was to retain the same oxidizable moiety while altering the lipophilicity. Additionally, we studied and compared the antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of gallic acid and gallates in cell-free systems.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Chemicals and Equipments.\n\nGallic acid, vanillic acid, methyl vanillate, (+-)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), _N_-ethylmaleimide (NEM), (+-)-a-tocopherol (vitamin E), 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), 5,5'-dithioish(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), glutathione (GSH), 8-hydroxypropyl-2,3,6-trisulfin acid trisulfin salt (pyramine), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picylhydrazyl (DPPH), \\(N\\),N_-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, amine hydroperoxide (Cu-OOH), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1), and _o_-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was prepared by diluting a 30% stock solution and calculating its concentration from its absorption at 240 nm (_ε_240 = 43.6 M-1 cm-1) (_18_). Column chromatography was carried out over 0.06-0.20 mm silica gel (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out in a Varian Prep-Star 400 system with a Phenomex C-18 (250 x 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Iowa 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz ('H) and 125 MHz ('C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-_d\n\n## Page 3\n\n37 degC. When present, apocynin, gallic acid, and gallates (100 _m_M) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 _ng_/mL catalase. The concentration of GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection, as previously described (2): For GSH determination, 50 _m_L of the above reaction mixture was added to 1.0 mL of 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. To a 20 _m_L aliquot of this mixture, 300 _m_L of 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0 and 20 _m_L of 0.1% OPA in methanol were added as this reaction mixture was incubated at 25 degC for 15 min in the dark in well-capped tubes, after which 20 _m_L of each sample was injected into the HPLC system. For GSSG determination, a 200 _m_L aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 degC with 200 _m_L of 40 mM NEM, for 25 min, in the dark, to react with the GSH present in the sample. To this mixture, 750 _m_L of 0.1 M NaOH was added. A 20 _m_L portion of this mixture was taken for measurement of GSSG, using the procedure outlined above for the GSH assay, except that 0.1 M NaOH was employed as the diluent rather than 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. The HPLC method for the determination of GSH and GSSG is based on derivatization with OPA to form a stable, highly fluorescent derivative (2). The derivatives of GSH and GSSG were separated by liquid chromatography (Varian ProStar in line with a fluorescence detector set at 350/420 nm). The analyses were carried out isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 _m_m). The mobile phase consisted of 15% methanol in 25 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 6.0 (flow rate of 0.5 mL/min).\n\n### Measurement of Oxygen Consumption.\n\nThe consumption of dissolved molecular oxygen during the oxidation of GSH was monitored in a YSI 5300A oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring, OH). The reaction mixture of 1 mM GSH, 100 _m_H2O2, and 0.1 _m_M HRP in PBS was incubated at 37 degC in the presence or absence (control) of 10 _m_M apocynin or gallates. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. The oxygen consumption was monitored for 10 min.\n\nPyranaine-Based Procedure for Evaluation of the Reactivity of Gallates with Peroxyl Radicals Generated by AAPH Thermolysis.\n\nThis experiment was performed as described by Lissi et al. (2_d_), with minor modifications. The experiments were based on the decay in the fluorescence of pyramine when it was submitted to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compound pyramine (5 _m_M) was incubated with 20 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 degC in the absence (control) or presence of gallates in the wells of a microplate. The fluorescence bleaching of the pyramine was monitored at _dx_= 460 nm and _x_= 510 nm in a Spectramax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The final reaction volume was 300 _m_L. The flag phase (induction time) obtained when the antioxidants were present was measured for various concentrations of each gallate. The slopes of the curves of induction time versus concentration were used to measure the relative reactivity of the gallates with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals.\n\n### Free-Radical Scavenging Activity on DPPH/DPPH Bleaching Assay.\n\nThe free-radical scavenger activity of gallic acid and its esters was compared by the DPPH bleaching assay (5). The antioxidants were incubated for 30 min with 100 _m_M DPPH in methyl alcohol in the dark. The scavenger activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm, using the absorbance of the unreacted DPPH radical as the control. The scavenger activity was calculated as ((absorbance of the control - absorbance of the sample)/absorbance of the control) x 100.\n\n## Results\n\nWe studied the hemolysis of erythrocytes and the protective effect of gallic acid and its esters. The molecular structures of the compounds studied are shown in **Figure 1**. Hemolysis was provoked by thermolysis of the azo compound AAPH, which generates a low but constant flux of peroxyl radicals when incubated at 37 degC (_15_). **Figure 2** shows the kinetic profile of hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid and propyl gallate. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent (Figure 3), and the esters methyl gallate (G1), propyl gallate (G3), and lauryl gallate (G12) were more effective inhibitors than their acid precursor, gallic acid (G0) (**Table 1**).\n\nBecause the above results suggest a higher efficacy of the esters as free-radical scavengers, we also compared their relative potency in cell-free models. First, they were compared as scavengers of the stable free-radical DPPH. The results depicted in **Table 2** show that no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its ester derivatives. In a second set of experiments, we studied the direct reactivity of gallic acid and its esters with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. In this assay, the relative reactivity of the antioxidants with peroxyl radicals is determined by the lag phase in the decay of pyramine fluorescence (2_d_). **Figure 4** shows the typical time profile of the bleaching obtained when pyramine was incubated with AAPH in the presence of gallic acid and methyl gallate. The linear relation between the delay and the concentration of gallic acid or gallates was used to measure the reactivity of the tested compound with AAPH. In this design, the slope of the curve is directly proportional to the efficiency of the antioxidant as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals. **Figure 4** also shows the typical linear correlation between the concentration and lag phase for gallic acid and methyl gallate. The slopes obtained were 442 +- 30 for gallic acid, 499 +- 31 for methyl gallate, 453 +- 6 for propyl gallate, and 187 +- 7 for lauryl gallate (mean +- SEM, \\(n\\) = 3). As can be observed, only lauryl gallate presented a\n\nFigure 1.: Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study.\n\nFigure 2.: AAPH-induced hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3). The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 °C. The results are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of duplicates of three separate experiments.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\ndecreased reactivity with peroxyl radicals in this experimental model.\n\nConsidering the above cell-free studies, the stronger antihemolytic effect of the gallates, relative to that of gallic acid, suggests that lipophilicity is a determining factor in this experimental model. To verify this proposal, we also compared the antioxidant vanillic acid versus its methyl ester (methyl vanillate) and trolox, a more water-soluble form of vitamin E, versus vitamin E itself. The results with these two different classes of antioxidants followed the same pattern as that for gallates and gallic acid, reinforcing the suggestion that lipophilicity of antioxidants is crucial with respect to antihemolytic protection (**Table 1**).\n\nThe direct hemolytic capacity of gallic acid and gallates was also investigated, because these compounds could interact with and disrupt the erythrocyte membrane. In these experiments, gallic acid and gallates were incubated with erythrocytes without AAPH. The results in **Table 3** show that only the 12-carbon ester lauryl gallate caused significant hemolysis after incubation for 6 h.\n\nThe protective effect of gallates was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis. The results given in **Table 4** show that gallates were also effective when the hemolysis was provoked by incubation of erythrocytes with cumene hydroperoxide. Again, there was a correlation with lipophilicity.\n\nIn a further experiment, the protective effect of gallic acid and gallates on the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by AAPH was also studied. Despite their antimobutyric properties, gallic acid and gallates were unable to inhibit the oxidation of GSH when erythrocytes were incubated with AAPH. On the contrary, the depletion of GSH was exacerbated by methyl and lauryl gallates (**Table 5**).\n\nTo clarify these findings, we studied the direct reaction between pure GSH and AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and tested the effect of gallic acid and gallates on this reaction. Again, the presence of gallic acid and gallates tended to exacerbate the oxidation of GSH (**Figure 5**).\n\nIn another set of experiments, pure GSH was oxidized by H2O3 in a reaction catalyzed by HRP. Because GSH is a poor substrate for peroxidase, the efficiency of oxidation was low (26). However, the addition of gallic acid and gallates caused a strong increase in the oxidation of GSH (**Figure 6**).\n\nIt is well-known that some phenolic compounds are able to act as a co-catalyst in reactions of inefficient peroxidase substrates, such as GSH. In such situations, the oxidized intermediate phenolic radical is reduced back and GSH is converted to GSSG. Moreover, during this redox cycle, the dissolved molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture is consumed, being reduced to superoxide anion (27). For these reasons and in light of our results, we measured the production of GSSG and the oxygen consumption as GSH was oxidized by HRP/H2O2 in the presence of gallic acid or gallates. To ascertain whether our experimental conditions for assessing the co-catalytic effect of phenols upon the oxidation of GSH was correct, we used apocynin, which is able to initiate this process, as a reference compound (28). As can be seen in **Figure 7**, both gallic acid and apocynin exacerbated the oxidation of GSH; however, only in the presence of apocynin was GSSG obtained as a product. Similarly, only in the presence of apocynin was the consumption of dissolved oxygen observed (**Figure 8**). The other gallates showed the same results as gallic acid (data not shown).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an _ex vivo_ model in the study of ROS-induced disruption of cell membranes. The inhibitory property of many antioxidants upon AAPH-induced hemolysis is well-documented (29-32). However, there is no clear relationship between the molecular structure of the antioxidants and their efficiency as inhibitors. Here, working with gallic acid and its ester derivatives, we found\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline experimental condition & percent hemolysis (3 h) & percent hemolysis (6 h) \\\\ \\(-\\)AAPH & \\(2 \\pm 1^{6}\\) & \\(3 \\pm 1^{6}\\) \\\\  & \\(17 \\pm 3^{6}\\) & \\(78 \\pm 7^{6}\\) \\\\  +G0 & \\(3 \\pm 2^{d}\\) & \\(72 \\pm 6\\) \\\\  +G1 & \\(3 \\pm 2^{d}\\) & \\(18 \\pm 5^{d}\\) \\\\  +G3 & \\(2 \\pm 1^{d}\\) & \\(9 \\pm 4^{d}\\) \\\\ +AAPH & +G12 & \\(\n\n## Page 5\n\nthat lipophilicity seems to be an essential characteristic of an efficient antihemolytic compound. Similar findings were reported by Wu et al. that ranked the antihemolytic efficiency of gallates as propyl > ethyl > methyl (_33_). Corroborating this proposal, the correlation between efficacy against AAPH-induced hemolysis and lipophilicity was not restricted to gallic acid and its ester derivatives but extended to other classes of molecules, such as vanillic acid versus its lipophilic derivative methyl vanillate and trolox versus vitamin E. Moreover, the benefit of lipophilicity was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis, because it was also seen when the erythrocytes were challenged with cumene hydroperoxide.\n\nReinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, our result showed clearly that higher antihemolytic efficacy of the gallates was not related to their oxidizability. Indeed, except for lauryl gallate, no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its esters in their potential as antioxidants in cell-free systems. Only the 12-carbon chain ester was relatively poor as a peroxyl radical scavenger in the cell-free systems. Despite that and again reinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, lauryl gallate was a more efficient inhibitor of hemolysis than gallic acid.\n\nIt is important to observe that any compound used as an antihemolytic agent when erythrocytes are challenged by free\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline experimental condition & percent hemolysis (2 h) \\\\ \\hline –Qu–OOH & & 8.1 ± 4.9a \\\\  & & 72.9 ± 1.6a \\\\  & 10 & 67 ± 1.7 \\\\  & +60 (_μM_) & 20 & 17 ± 6.9a \\\\  & +G1 (_μM_) & 10 & 11.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nradicals could also interact directly with the cell membrane and provoke its disruption. This effect has been described, and there is a relationship between lipophilicity and hemolytic capacity developed by many compounds [34, 35]. Accordingly, lauryl gallate, the most lipophilic compound used in this study, was the only ester capable of inducing hemolysis of erythrocytes under our experimental conditions.\n\nOther important findings include the interaction of gallic acid and gallates with GSH. This chemical feature could explain or be involved in the recent findings about cellular pro-oxidant effects of gallates [13, 14]. This tripeptide is the main endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) reflects directly the redox status of the cell [36]. It is well-known that redox homeostasis is crucial for cells to survive, and the pathophysiological mechanisms of several diseases are related to the exacerbated production of ROS and/or decreased antioxidant functions [37]. In fact, apoptosis, which is altered in tumor cells, strongly depends upon the GSH/GSSG ratio [38, 39]. Two pathways could explanation the exacerbated oxidation of GSH when gallates are present in the reaction mixture or cellular medium. The first is the action of these compounds as co-catalysts, where the intermediate phenoxyl radical would be reduced back to gallate with concomitant oxidation of GSH. This phenomenon is well-established for phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine and apocynin [27, 28], and the consequence of this redox cycle is the consumption of GSH, the formation of GSSG, and the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion [40]. This was exactly what we observed for apocynin, used as a model for a comparison to gallates in this study. However, when gallates were used, the consumption of GSH was not followed by the formation of GSSG and the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Hence, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for the augmented depletion of GSH caused by gallic acid and gallates.\n\nThe second possible explanation for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates in the depletion of intracellular GSH is a chemical reaction between the oxidized trihydroxybenzene moiety, probably in its quinone form, and GSH via the Michael\n\nFigure 5.: Oxidation of GSH by BAPH and effect of gallic acid and gallates. The reaction system (positive control) consisted of 2.5 mM AAPH and 100 _μ_M GSH in PBS, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. When present, the gallates were 100 _μ_M. The results are mean ± SEM of duplicates of five separate experiments.

This is a well-known reaction that involves electrophilic quinones and nucleophilic substances, such as GSH, leading to thiol adducts (_41_, _42_). In this case, the consumption of GSH is not followed by the formation of GSSG and oxygen consumption, as verified here. In summary, **Scheme 1** shows our proposal for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates when these compounds were oxidized in the presence of GSH, which could explain the depletion of intracellular GSH as verified here and by others (_13_, _14_).\n\n## Literature Cited\n\n* (1) Bertelli, A.

Nair\n\nInstituto de Quimica, UNESP-Sao Paulo State University, C.P. 355, CEP 14800-900, Araraquara, SP, Brazil, Departamento de Ciencias Exatas, Federal University of Alfernas, 37130-000, Alfernas, MG, Brazil, and Bioactive Natural Products and Phytochemicals, Department of Horticulture and National Food Safety and Toxicology Center, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824\n\n###### Abstract\n\nPhylochemical work in the search for bioactive metabolites from the methanolic extract of _Senna spectabilis_ green fruits led to the isolation of a new piperidine alkaloid, (+)-3-O-feruloylcassine (**1**), in addition to the known (-)-spectaline (**2**) and (-)-3- O-acetylspectaline (**3**). The isolates were submitted to in vitro evaluation of lipoperoxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and -2) inhibitory properties and showed moderate antioxidant activities (40-70%) at 100 ppm when compared to commercial standards BHT and vitamin E and moderate inhibition of COX-1 (ca. 40%) and marginal inhibition of COX-2 enzymes (<10%) at 100 ppm when compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin, rofecoxib, and celecoxib, respectively.\n\nThe chemotaxonomy of widely occurring _Senna_ and _Cassia_ (Fabaceae) species has been the subject of extensive studies, leading to reclassification of some species, including _Cassia spectabilis_.1 Both of these genera exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties and ethnomedical uses, especially those associated with inflammation.2-6 In Brazil, the tea of their crushed leaves is used to treat throat inflammation and diarrhea.7 Therefore, many plants belonging to _Senna_ and _Cassia_ species have been or are being studied for their anti-inflammatory botanical extracts or for the isolation of new metabolites with unique chemical structures, mode of action, selectivity, and/or effectiveness. Extracts of species from both genera have been investigated for anti-inflammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. For example, _Cassia italica_ is one of the most studied species due to its analgesic, antipyretic, laxative, and antitumor properties.8 Its ethanolic extract decreased the severity of rat paw edema in a potency comparable to acetylsalicylic acid and inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis by rat peritoneal leucocytes.9 An extract of _Senna dariensis_ has been used against snakebite and was highly active in the inhibition of the hemorrhagic effect of the venom from _Bothprops atrox_,10 whereas _Senna neglecta_ and _Senna alata_ have been used in southern Brazil and Thailand, respectively, to treat inflammation linked to microbial infection.11,12 _Cassia tora_ and _C. angustifolia_ leaf extracts have also shown anti-inflammatory properties using in vivo models with histamine-induced rat hind paw edema and 12-_O_-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema, respectively, whereas _C. fistula_ leaves methanolic extract was evaluated in vitro models and efficiently protected free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in model membranes and also inhibited the 5-lipoxygenase-mediated peroxidation of arachidonic acid.13-15\n\nAs part of our ongoing research on active metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of Sao Paulo State (Brazil), we have recently reported the isolation of several new piperidine alkaloids including (-)-spectaline (**2**), (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (**3**), and (+)-spectaline from leaves, flowers, and ripe fruits of _Senna spectabilis_, which showed anti-inflammatory and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties.16-18 Herein we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new piperidine alkaloid, (+)-3-O-feruloylcassine (**1**), from unripe fruits of _Senna_ (DC.) Irwin & Barneby), along with the identification of the known alkaloids **2** and **3**. In addition, we also report their free radical scavenging potential toward DPPH, lipoperoxidation (LPO), and cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitory activities.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a pale yellow solid (mp 7-74 \\(\\U\\)C). HRESIMS and elemental analysis of **1** indicated the molecular formula C23H43NO3, with eight degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum suggested the presence of secondary amine (3413, 1514 cm-1), ketone (1710 cm-1), and olefinic (3050, 1629, 1529 cm-1) moieties. The 'H NMR spectroscopic signals for two vital olefinic methines at d 7.68 (d, \\(J\\) = 15.5 Hz, H-7 ) and d 6.36 (d, \\(J\\) = 15.5 Hz, H-8 ) with a _trans_ relative configuration, three aromatic methanes at d 7.06 (brs, H-2 ), d 7.00 (d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-6 ), and d 6.82 (d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-5 ), and three methyl protons at d 3.81 (s, H-10 ) suggested a derived moiety in compound **1**. This spectrum also gave signals for one oxymethine hydrogen at d 4.99 (brs, H-3), three methyl protons at d 1.19 (m, H-7), and two methines at d 3.14 (m, H-2) and 2.80 (m, H-6). The two multiplets at d 1.62 and 1.48, integrated for four protons, were assigned to H-46/H-54\\({}_{\\text{eq}}\\) and H-46/H-54\\({}_{\\text{av}}\\), respectively, on the basis of correlations observed in the 'H-1H COSY spectrum. Signals for methylene protons at d 1.48 (m, H-1 ), 1.16-1.21 (m, H-2 -H-9 ), and 2.34 (t, 7.5 Hz, H-10 ) and methyl protons at d 2.06 (s, H-12 ) clearly indicated a long saturated side chain as previously observed in compounds **2** and **3**.16 The \\({}^{1}\\)C NMR and DEPT-1357 spectra showed signals for three methines carbons at d 69.0, 56.9, and 54.4,\n\n## Page 2\n\nmethylene carbons at d 29.1-29.7, and one methyl carbon at d 16.9, which strongly supported the 2,6-disubstituted-piperidin-3-ol ring similar to those reported for (-)-spectaline (**2**) and (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (**3**)16 (Figure 1).\n\nThe joint analysis of the 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and HMBC spectra evidenced signals for a carbonyl carbon at d 209.6, correlating to methylene protons at d 2.34 and to methyl protons at d 2.06, which were assigned to a terminal methyl ketone subunit on the side chain at C-6. The carboxyl signal at d 166.7 correlated to the olefinic methine at d 7.68 in the HMBC spectrum and suggested an a,d-unsaturated conjugation between the piperidine unit and the 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring. The downfield value of the methine carbon at d 69.0, when compared to that in (-)-spectaline (d 67.9), and its correlation with the H-7 methyl protons led us to propose a conjugated ester at C-3 on the piperidine ring. The HMBC correlations observed for the methoxy protons at d 3.81 to the quaternary carbon at d 147.0 and for the aromatic methines H-2 (d 7.06), H-5 (d 6.82) to the carbon at d 148.3 evidenced the presence of aromatic methoxy and hydroxy substituents at C-3 and C-4 (Figure 1). The NOESY 1D experiment indicated the position of methoxy at C-3 and hydroxy at C-4 on the basis of the sole spatial correlation of the methoxy protons and H-2. All of these assignments were confirmed by additional HMBC correlations and led us to propose the structure of 2-methyl-3-feruloyl-6-(dodecyl-11 -one)piperidine for compound **1**, which was confirmed by the molecular ion peak at _m/z_ 474.3198 in its HRESIMS. The relative configurations at C-2, C-3, and C-6 were established by comparison of the coupling constants observed for **1** with those published for **2** and **3**16,19 and NOESY 1D experiments. The irradiation of the H-2 signal confirmed its relative spatial correlations to H-3, H-4a, H-6, and H-7 protons as _cis_. Therefore, the structure of **1** was assigned as (+)-2-methyl-3-feruloyl-6-(dodecyl-11 -one)piperidine.\n\nThe free radical scavenging activity of compounds **1-3** was evaluated spectrophotometrically by using the stable free radical DPPH and measuring the decrease in absorption at 517 nm. Compounds **2** and **3** were weakly active in this assay and exhibited absorbance variation lower than 10% at 60 ppm. However, compound **1** showed moderate activity (%\\(\\Delta\\)A = 40% at 60 ppm) when compared to the standard truth (%\\(\\Delta\\)A = 92% at 60 ppm), which may be associated with the presence of a feruloyl moiety in the structure of **1**.\n\nThe lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity of the isolates was evaluated by measurement of the fluorescence decay after adding Fe\\({}^{2+}\\) to initiate the oxidation of large unilamellar vesicles. The alkaloids were tested at 100 ppm, the extract was tested at 250 ppm, and commercial antioxidants BHT, BHA, and vitamin E were used as standard reference compounds at 1.9, 2.2, and 4.3 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids **2** and **3** exhibited moderate inhibition (ca. 75% after 21 min, Figure 2) of the liposome peroxidation. Alkaloid **1** showed only 50% inhibition of the LPO, despite the presence of a feruloyl moiety in its structure, which is normally associated with an increase in antioxidant activity. This behavior might be at least partly explained by the possible chelation of Fe\\({}^{2+}\\) ions by compounds **2** and **3**, in contrast to the poor ability for Fe\\({}^{2+}\\) chelation of compound **1**. The use of AAPH as the free radical initiator, instead of Fe\\({}^{2+}\\), confirmed this observation by showing a similar trend in lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (ca. 50%) by compounds **1-3**.\n\nInhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzyme activity of compounds **1-3** was evaluated by polarographic measurement of the oxygen uptake during the COX-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Each alkaloid was tested at 100 ppm and compared to standard reference compounds refecoxib, celecoxib, and aspirin, which were tested at 1.7, 1.7, and 108 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids **1-3** inhibited COX-1 enzyme by 33, 40, and 58%, respectively. However, the inhibitory activities of COX-2 enzyme by these compounds were marginal (Figure 3).\n\nIn summary, we have isolated three alkaloids (**1-3**) from the green fruits of _S. spectabilis_, which showed weak to moderate free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH and moderate lipoperoxidation inhibitory properties. In addition, these compounds displayed moderate anti-inflammatory activities, especially toward COX-1. Additional research is needed to further explain the anecdotal medicinal claims of this fruit and its potential to be considered as a medicinal or dietary supplement.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**Plant Material.** Plant material was collected in February 2004 from a specimen of _Sema specethilis_ cultivated in the Chemistry Institute at Sao Paulo State University (Aararaquara-SP). A voucher (SP 370917) was deposited at the herbarium of Sao Paulo Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** Green fruits of _S. specethilis_ (8 kg) were ground and extracted with EtOH (5 x 5 L). Evaporation of solvent yielded 676 g of a crude extract (8.5%). The extract was analyzed by TLC (silica gel, CHCl\\({}_{3}\\)-MeOH\\(-\\)NH\\({}_{4}\\)OH, 36:3:1) to confirm the presence of alkaloids by spraying with Dragonoff and iodochloro-platinate reactions. This extract (9 g) was then suspended in MeOH\\(-\\)H\\({}_{2}\\)O, 4:1, the insoluble residue was removed by filtration, and the remaining solution was partitioned successively with hexanes, CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{3}\\), EtOHac, and \\(n\\)-BuOH. Analysis of the organic fractions by TLC revealed that most of the alkaloid constituents were concentrated in the CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) fraction (5.7 g). An aliquot of the CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) fraction (1 g) was then fractionated by neutral alumina column chromatography (hexanes/Et\\({}_{2}\\)O and Et\\({}_{3}\\)O/MeOH gradients) to give 30 fractions.

Le Roch, Mario A. Izidoro, Paulo C. Vieira\n\n# Abstract\n\n_Metrodorea stipularis_ stem extracts were studied in the search for possible antichagastic, antimalarial, and antitumoral compounds using cruzain from _Tympanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium falciparum_, and cathepsin B and L, as molecular targets, respectively. Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed significant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Compounds 1-4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 \\(\\mu\\)M against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three different strains of _P. falciparum_ in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsin B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 \\(\\mu\\)M. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe study of the role of the various species of dihydrochalcones is a key step in the development of the biological process of cancer.

Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6-trihydroyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2,en-1-yl)phenyl)propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2\n\nCompounds **2** and **3** were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESTTOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for **2** and **3**, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C23H30O3 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for **2** and **3** showed one singlet at \\(d\\) 5.92 attributed to H-8', the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both **2** and **3** the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.76 (H-3') and 2.53 (H-4') and the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.33 (H-9' and H-10'). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at \\(d\\) 6.91 (H-5' and H-7') and 6.56 (H-8') for **2** and signals at \\(d\\) 6.87 (H-2'), 6.83 (H-6'), and 6.64 (H-5') for **3** assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound **2** showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.73 (H-3') and 2.69 (H-4') and the signals of the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.22 (H-8' and H-9'). Compound **3** displayed one premyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4'' and H-5''), one olefinic hydrogen at \\(d\\) 5.28 (H-2''), and the methylene signal at \\(d\\) 3.25 (H-1''). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in **1** and confirmed the structures of **2** and **3**.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESTTOFMS data showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (calculated _m_/_z_ 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O3. As mentioned for compounds **2** and **3**, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the characteristic signals of the three methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at \\(d\\) 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and confirmed the structure of **4**.\n\nThe dihydrochalcones **1**-**4** showed inhibition activities against crazin, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 _m_M (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the first report of crazin inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies.\n\nDihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 _m_M (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochalcones **1** and **3** showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these compounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more effective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydrochalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsin s such as cathepsin K.12\n\nThe dihydrochalcones were also tested against _Plasmodium falciparum_ growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against _P. falciparum_ the dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** showed significant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 _m_M for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against _P. falciparum_ growth for this class of compounds.\n\nFour compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases crazin and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of _Plasmodium falciparum_. The results described in this paper are significant, since this is the first report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against crazin, and it is interesting that compounds **2** and **4** are active against cathepsin B, while compounds **1** and **3** are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of finding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nAll commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co, and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-_4\\(6\\) and methanol-_4\\(p\\) using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe AITA). MS data were collected on a Bruker Dalonics micrOTOF-Q. II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H5SO/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230-700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna).\n\n### Plant Materials.\n\nThe stems of _Metrodarea stipularis_ were collected in July 2010 at the Agornomic Institute in Campinas, SP1; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 degC, affording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against crucain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed significant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 5.0 cm x h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10.0, 15.5, 5.5, 0.10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1-MSD24).\n\nFraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15.1-MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg).\n\nFraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 3.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD211_1-MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD211_8-MSD21\\(8\\)20). Subfraction MSD21_8 12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21\\(8\\)19 (9 mg) was purified by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, _ph_ = 1.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/cAMP/H2O (4:15) as mobile phase and a flow of 3.5 mL/min to afford 4 (2.5 mg).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)/propan-1-one (2):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2066 (caled for C3H2H2O3 _m_/_z_ 410.2094).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(14-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4-trimethyl-2,3,44,96-hydroxy-10-Mantham-7-ylpropan-1-one (4):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 2; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (caled for C9H2O3 _m_/_z_ 478.2720).\n\n**Enzyme Inhibition Assays.**_Gruzin._ All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectrofluorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured by hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonylphenylanalytarginine-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide). The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) with 5 mL of DTT at 37 degC after addition of 2 mL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with five inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the program GraFit S.\n\n_Cothepins._ All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Molecular Devices Spectra\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & compound 2 & compound 3 & \\\\ position & _δ_0°_a_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ \\\\\n1 & 204.7, qC & & 204.0, qC & & \\\\\n2 & 45.5, CH2 & 3.30, t (7.2) & 6°, 1, 3 & 45.5, CH2 & 3.25, t & 1, 2° \\\\\n3′ & 29.7, CH2 & 2.83 & 5′, 7′, 1, 2 & 30.2, CH2 & 2.82, t (8.4) & 1′\n\n## Page 4\n\nMAX M3 fluorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic fluorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and a concentration of 185 _m_M for catB and 10 _m_M for catL. The enzyme was activated for 5 min with DTT and acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 degC, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 200 _m_L, kept under stirring (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptides, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with at least seven inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot 12.0.\n\n_Bioasory of Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth._ The strains 3D7, W2, and Dd2 of _P. falciparum_ malaria parasites (BEI Resources, MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in human type O+ erythrocytes in complete medium (RPMI 1640 (Celgrg), 0.043 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 0.014 mg/mL hypoxanthine (Acros), 38.5 mm HEPES (Sigma), 0.18% NaHCO3 (Celgrg), 0.20% Glucose (MP Biomedical), 0.003 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.2% Albumax (Gibco), 5% human serum) as previously described.1 Briefly, cultures were maintained in 25 cm2 flasks (Corning) at a volume of 10 mL and were glassed for 30 s with an environment of 3% CO2, 1% O2, and 96% N2, then incubated at 37 degC.\n\nThe antimalarial activity was determined with a SYBR Green based parasite proliferation assay, adapted from Smilkstein15 and Bennett.16 Using this technique, the increase of parasite DNA contained in human red blood cells was measured after 72 h of incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds.17 Relative fluorescence values were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM fluorimeter (excitation 495 nm and emission 525 nm).

These bacteria are responsible for producing two-thirds of the commercially available antibiotics [2, 3]. Most antibacterial species explored commercially were isolated from the soil. However, after decades of bioprospecting antibacterials from this environment, it is becoming more difficult to obtain strains producing novel bioactive metabolites [4]. Thus, many companies have turned the search for microbial producers of novel antifungal compounds to other environments such as hydrothermal vents,\n\n## Page 2\n\nmarine environments, tropical rain forests, and microbial symbionts associated with plants and animals hosts [5, 6]. For example, the occurrence of actinobacteria associated with marine sponges and the fact that such strains produce compounds with antimicrobial activity confirms this potential [7, 8, 9]. In addition, endophytic actinobacteria are also explored for their capacity to produce antimicrobial compounds [10, 11, 12].\n\nSeveral studies have focused on the association between actinobacteria and insects from an ecological perspective [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. On the other hand, few studies have focused on the multitude of chemical compounds that are involved in such interactions [26]. The best studied example is the symbiosis between actinobacteria and fungus-growing ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: tribe Attini). In this association, the actinobacteria are found on the ants' integument and produce antimicrobial compounds that help the ants to suppress the microfungus _Escovopsis_ sp. [13, 14]. This fungus is considered a specialized parasite of the ant cultivar and causes negative impacts to the ant colony [27].\n\nActinobacteria isolated from the integument of attine ants are generally classified in the genus _Pseudonocardia_ and _Streptomyces_. Bioactive molecules have already been isolated and characterized from actinobacteria isolated from several attine genera [26]. _Pseudonocardia_ isolated from _Acromyrmex octopinosus_ and _Apterostigma dentigerum_ are known to produce several compounds like (i) dentigerumycin, a complex compound active against _Candida albicans_ and _Escovopsis_[28]; (ii) a nystatin-like antifungal [29]; (iii) the novel quinone pseudonocardones A-C active against the malaria causal agent _Plasmodium berghei_[30]; (iv) the already known antibiotics 6-deoxy-8-O-methylrabelomycin and X-14 881, both active against _Bacillus subtilis_ and _P. berghei_[30]. In addition to _Pseudonocardia_, actinobacteria in the genus _Streptomyces_ are also found on the integument of _Acromyrmex_ workers and were shown to produce (i) candidin, active against _Escovopsis_ sp. [29, 31, 32, 33, 34], (ii) antimycins active against _Escovopsis_ sp. [32, 33, 34], and (iii) actinomycin D, actinomycin X2 and valinomycin that are active against _B. subtilis_[32].\n\nPoulsen [35] suggested that the attine ant-microbe association is little explored regarding the search for new antimicrobials. The author highlights the various symbiotic associations between attine ants and microorganisms as a promising source for drug discovery, especially those with antimicrobial activity. Here, we explored the antimicrobial potential of actinobacteria isolated from the integument of _Trachymyrmex_ fungus-growing ants and demonstrate the action against different medically important _Candida_ species. We also report two previously described urauchimycins from a _Streptomyces_ strain and emphasize the newly discovered anti-_Candida_ activity of these compounds.\n\n## 2 Material and Methods\n\n### Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification\n\nTwelve _Trachymyrmex_ colonies were collected in different Brazilian biomes (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material available online at [http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/835081](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/835081)). Colonies were carefully excavated in order to reach the first fungus garden chamber. Fungus garden with the tending workers and brood was sampled using an alcohol-flamed spoon and stored in sterile plastic containers. All containers were kept in a cooler during transport to the laboratory where they were maintained at 25degC.\n\nFrom each colony, we randomly selected four workers for actinobacteria isolation. Then, the propleural plates were scraped with a sterile needle under a low power stereomicroscope. All ants used in the present study had a visible, whitish covering on the propleural plates. Scrapings were plated on SCN agar (in g \\(\\cdot\\) L\\({}^{-1}\\): 10.0 starch, 0.3 casein, 2.0 KNO3, 2.0 NaCl, 2.0 K2HPO4, 0.05 MgSO4, 7 H2O, 0.02 CaCO3, 0.01 FeSO4. 7H2O and 18.0 agar supplemented with 0.05 Nystatin) [36]. After scraping, the entire body of all workers was inoculated on SCN agar. All plates were incubated at 25degC for 30 days. From each sampled _Trachymyrmex_ colony, one representative strain was selected from each morphotype obtained. The strains were subcultured in YMA (in g \\(\\cdot\\) L\\({}^{-1}\\): 3.0 yeast extract, 3.0 malt extract, 5.0 peptone, 10.0 glucose, 18.0 agar) and stored at \\(-80\\)degC in 15% glycerol.\n\nWe used a molecular approach to provide taxonomic affiliation to actinobacteria strains. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method of Sampaio et al. [37]. We carried out 16S rDNA PCR with the universal primers 27F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-3') and 1492R (5'-TACGGTTACCTTTGTTACGACTT-3') [38]. Reactions were conducted in a final volume of 25 \\(\\mu\\)L and contained 1 \\(\\mu\\)L of diluted DNA template (1:10), 2.0 \\(\\mu\\)L of each primer (10 mM), 2.5 \\(\\mu\\)L of 10X buffer, 1.0 \\(\\mu\\)L of MgCl2 (50 mM), 4.0 \\(\\mu\\)L of dNTPs (1.25 mM each), 0.2 \\(\\mu\\)L of Taq polymerase (5 U/\\(\\mu\\)L), and 12.3 \\(\\mu\\)L of ultrapure water. Amplicons were cleaned up with _GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit_ (GE Healthcare). Forward and reverse sequences were generated using the same primers, along with an internal primer U519F (5'-CAGCMGCCGGCGTAATWC-3'). Sequences were generated using _BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit_ (Life Technologies) in an ABI 3130 sequencer and manually edited in BioEdit v. 7.1.3 [39]. Contigs were compared with those available in the databases NCBI-GenBank ([http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) and Ribosomal Database Project (RDP, [http://rdp.cmc.msu.edu/](http://rdp.cmc.msu.edu/)). Sequences generated in the present study were deposited in NCBI-GenBank (accessions KC480554-KC480557).\n\nA phylogenetic analysis was carried out in order to determine the taxonomic affiliation of strain TD025. Sequences of closest relatives were retrieved from the NCBI-GenBank and the RDP Project and aligned in ClustalW. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in PAUP v. 4.0 [40]. Genetic distances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model of nucleotide substitution [41]. Robustness of the relationships was estimated from 1000 bootstrap pseudocircles.\n\n### Organic Extracts and Antifungal Assays\n\nAll actinobacteria were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 50 mL of modified MPE medium (in g \\(\\cdot\\) L\\({}^{-1}\\): 5.0 soy flour,\n\n## Page 3\n\n20.0 glucose, 5.0 of NaCl, 4.0 CaCO3) [42]. Each flask was inoculated with five mycelium disks (1 cm in diameter) cut from a previously grown culture and then incubated at 28degC for two days on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. From this culture, 10 mL was inoculated in two Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 100 mL of the same medium and incubated for five days on the same conditions. After incubation, the fermented broth was separated from the mycelium by centrifugation and partitioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the EtOAc extracts were diluted in RPMI-1640 culture broth containing 10% DMSO and used in the antimicrobial assays.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated against the yeasts _Candida albicans_ CBS 562, _Candida dubliniensis_ CBS 7987, _Candida glabrata_ CBS 138, _Candida krusei_ CBS 573, _Candida parapsilosis_ CBS 604, and _Candida tropicialis_ CBS 94. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the microdilution method according to the M27-A2 standard of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [43].\n\n### Isolation and Characterization of the Bioactive Compounds of Strain TD025\n\nThe actinobacteria strain that exhibited both a broad antifungal spectrum and lower MIC values was strain TD025. In order to identify the compounds responsible for the observed results, the strain was cultured in 5 L of modified MPE medium and the extracts were obtained as described.\n\nThe fermented broth (5 L) was separated from the cells by centrifugation and portioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The crude extract, a dark green oil (1.40 g), was separated by means of column chromatography using silica gel 60 eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc as the elution gradient, yielding 8 fractions. All fractions were submitted to antimicrobial assays against _C. albicans_ following the procedure described above. The most active fraction (67.5 mg) was subjected to preparative TLC (thin layer chromatography) eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7:3) two times, yielding 3 subfractions. The subfractions obtained were submitted to antimicrobial assays against _C. albicans_. The most active subfraction was submitted to semipreparative HPLC separations carried out in a Shimadzu (LC-6AD apparatus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-MI0Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP). The separation was carried out using VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18 column eluted with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.01) at a flow rate of 3 mL min-1, yielding compounds **1** and **2**. The isolated molecules were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic experiments recorded on a BRUKER DRX-400 spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard.\n\n### Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Fungicide Concentration of Bioactive Compounds\n\nAfter isolation and determination of the structure of the targeted compounds, they were evaluated for antimicrobial activity following the method described previously. Besides the MIC determination, we also evaluated the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The MFC was determined by inoculating Sabouraud dextrose medium with 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of the contents of each of the wells where there was growth inhibition of yeast, the MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the substance capable of preventing the onset of colony forming units.\n\n## 3 Results and Discussion\n\n### Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification\n\nSeveral actinobacteria colonies were observed after incubation of isolation plates. We selected just one morphotype of each per ant colony, rendering a total of 24 strains out of 12 _Trabymyrmex_ spp. nests (Table S1). Four actinobacteria genera were identified and _Streptomyces_ was the most abundant taxon (Table I), corresponding to 66.67% of the strains. It is assumed that the main actinobacteria associated with the integument of attire workers is the genus _Pseudonocardia_[14, 15, 16, 20]. However, several authors have demonstrated the isolation of actinobacteria other than _Pseudonocardia_ on the integument of attire ants [17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 29, 31]. The prevalence of _Streptomyces_ and absence of _Pseudonocardia_ among our isolates may be due to the culture medium used [44]. The SCN medium is suitable for the isolation of fast-growing actinobacteria, but according to other authors [13, 14, 15, 16], the use of a low-nutrient medium, such as chitin agar, may provide the recovery of _Pseudonocardia_ strains.\n\nIn eight out of 12 ant colonies, we obtained more than one actinobacteria morphotype (Table S1). From colony CTL080820-02, the two morphotypes isolated from two different workers were identified as the same actinobacteria species (Tables S1 and 1). On the other hand, different actinobacteria species were isolated in the seven remaining colonies. We also observed the occurrence of different actinobacteria strains in a single worker (Tables S1 and I). This result demonstrates the diversity of actinobacteria present on the integument of these ants (Table S1, nests SES08091I-04 and SES080924-01).\n\nThe 16S rDNA sequence of strain TD025 showed 99% similarity with sequences of several species of the genus _Streptomyces_ deposited in the databases. For a better characterization, we performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure I). The result suggests a differentiated phylogenetic position for strain TD025 when compared with the remaining sequences. This preliminary analysis allowed us to assign this strain as belonging to the genus _Streptomyces_, with _S. citratus_ as the closest relative strain (Figure I). However, more refined phylogenetic analyses, along with morphological and physiological studies, are necessary to ensure the identification of TD025 to the species level.\n\n### Screening for Antifungal Activity\n\nOur screening for antifungal activity revealed that seven out of 24 extracts (29.16%) inhibited the growth of at least one _Candida_ species. _C. albicans_ was the most sensitive yeast and was \n\n## Page 4\n\ninhibited by seven extracts with MIC ranging between 10 and 1000 \\(\\mu\\)g\\(\\cdot\\) mL\\({}^{-1}\\) (Table 2). The yeasts _C. glabrata_ and _C. tropicalis_ were the most resistant strains, being inhibited by one and two actinobacteria extracts, respectively, with MIC values of 1000 \\(\\mu\\)g\\(\\cdot\\) mL\\({}^{-1}\\) (Table 2).\n\nExcept for strain TD034 identified as _Amycolatopsis decaplanina_ (Table 1), the other actinobacteria exhibiting antimicrobial activity were identified as belonging to the genus _Streptomyces_. This genus is recognized as the largest producer of antibiotics because from approximately 3,000 known antibiotics obtained from actinobacteria, the genus _Streptomyces_ contributes with 90% of this total [45].\n\nThe extracts of _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025 and _Streptomyces crystallinus_ TD027 showed activity against all yeast strains except for _C. glabrata._ These extracts were effective against _C. albicans_ and _C. krusei_ and showed low activity against _C. tropicalis_ (Table 2). More interestingly, both strains were isolated from the same colony but from independent workers (Table 1). Because lower MICs were obtained for the extract of _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025, this strain was selected to verify the chemical compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity.\n\n### Bioactive Compounds of Streptomyces sp. TD025.\n\nChromatographic procedures revealed that EtOAc extract from TD025 contains two compounds (**1** and **2**, Figure 2). Compounds **1** and **2** exhibited typical NMR data of urauchimycins (Figures S1 and S2). Their NMR data are in agreement with those previously reported by Imamura et al. [46]. Although these urauchimycins (**1** and **2**) have already been isolated, they have never been tested on various species of _Candida_ as carried out in the present study.\n\nThe \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **1** showed 22 carbon signals: four carbonyls (\\(\\delta\\) 179.0, \\(\\delta\\) 170.6, \\(\\delta\\) 169.8, and \\(\\delta\\) 158.7), three quaternary sp\\({}^{2}\\) carbons (\\(\\delta\\) 150.6, \\(\\delta\\) 127.4, and \\(\\delta\\) 112.8), three methine aromatic carbons (\\(\\delta\\) 124.8, \\(\\delta\\) 120.6, and \\(\\delta\\) 119.0), two sp\\({}^{3}\\) methylene group (\\(\\delta\\) 35.6 and \\(\\delta\\) 30.5), three sp\\({}^{3}\\) methine groups (\\(\\delta\\) 54.0, \\(\\delta\\) 50.1, and \\(\\delta\\) 32.4), three oxymethinic groups (\\(\\delta\\) 77.1, \\(\\delta\\) 76.3, and \\(\\delta\\) 70.9), and four methyl groups (\\(\\delta\\) 18.4, \\(\\delta\\) 18.4, \\(\\delta\\) 15.1, and \\(\\delta\\) 11.4). Two carboxylic carbons \\(\\delta\\) 170.6 and \\(\\delta\\) 173.9 showed correlations with different hydrogens of the structure, showing a dilatone system of nine members, typical of the antimycin class.\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum showed a singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 8.50, assigned to a hydrogen bounded to a carbonyl group and three aromatic hydrogens at \\(\\delta\\) 8.55 (dd, \\(\\delta\\) 81 and 1.2 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 7.24 (dd, \\(J\\) 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), and \\(\\delta\\) 6.92 (t, \\(J\\) 8.1 Hz), suggesting a 1,2,3 trisubstituted aromatic ring. The substance was identified as urauchimycin A by comparison with the literature data [46].\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **2** were very similar to those observed for compound **1**. Differences were observed in chemical shifts of the hydrogen of the methyl and methylene\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\hline \\hline Isolate Id & bp\\({}^{1}\\) & NCBI-GenBank closest relative & Coverage & \\% & Accession \\# \\\\ \\hline TD016 & 1251 & _Nocardia neocaledoniensis_ DSM 44717 & 100 & 100 & JF79731I \\\\ TD017 & 1248 & _Nocardia neocaledoniensis_ DSM 44717 & 100 & 100 & JF79731I \\\\ TD018 & 1184 & _Streptomyces zoamyceticus_ NRLL B-2038 & 99 & 100 & NR044144 \\\\ TD019 & 1342 & _Streptomyces allvochromogenes_ NBRC 3404 & 99 & 100 & AB184761 \\\\ TD020 & 1167 & _Streptomyces samanensis_ NBRC 14239 & 99 & 99 & NR041I60 \\\\ TD021 & 1250 & _Streptomyces mauvecolor_ NBRC 13854 & 100 & 99 & NR041I54 \\\\ TD022 & 1254 & _Streptomyces lydicus_ CGMCC 4.1412 & 100 & 100 & JN566018 \\\\ TD023 & 1246 & _Streptomyces_ sp.

Based on published data [46] compound **2** was identified as Urauchimycin B, an isomer of compound **1**.\n\nUrauchimycins belong to the antimycin class, a group of well-known antifungals. Antimycins act by inhibiting the electron flow in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [47]. Antimycins have been previously identified in _Streptomyces_ isolated from the integument of atting ants [32, 33, 34]. Schoenian and colleagues [32] detected the well-know antimycins Al-A4 in 50% of the actinobacteria identified as _Streptomyces_ isolated from workers of several _Acromyrrmex_ species. These data along with the rare antimycins identified in the present study indicate that this chemical class is often produced by _Streptomyces_ associated with atting ants. Compounds belonging to this class may have an important role in the atting ant-microbe association.\n\nAnother antifungal compound widely distributed in _Streptomyces_ associated with atting ants is candididin [31, 32, 33, 34], which was not detected in _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025. It is possible that candididin was lost in one of the purification steps of the AcOEt extract or it is not produced by this strain.\n\nUrauchimycins A and B were previously isolated from _Streptomyces_ sp. Ni-80 isolated from a marine sponge in Urauchicove, Irimore, Japan. These substances were the first antimycins having an odd number of carbons and a branching side chain [46]. Imamura et al. [46] suggested that such structures are the result of an evolution of actinobacteria in the marine environment, which could have resulted in a change in their secondary metabolism.\n\nIn 2006, two new urauchimycins were described: urauchimycin C, isolated from _Streptomyces_ sp. Bl751 from marine sediment, and urauchimycin D, isolated from _Streptomyces_ sp. AddM21 from soil [48]. In the study by Imamura and coworkers [46], the urauchimycins A and B inhibited the morphological differentiation of _C. albicans_ up to a concentration of 10 \\(\\mu\\)g\\(\\cdot\\) mL\\({}^{-1}\\). Urauchimycins C and D showed no inhibitory activity against _C. albicans_, _Mucor miehei_, and bacteria [48].\n\nThe study of antimicrobial activity of urauchimycins A and B was restricted to _C. albicans_ in the work by Imamura and colleagues [46]. The reisolation of these molecules in the present study allowed a better evaluation of its spectrum of\n\nFigure 1: Phylogenetic relationships of strain TD025 (in bold) isolated from the integument of _Traclymyrrnex_ sp. The phylogeny was inferred from 165 rDNA sequences retrieved from the NCBI-GenBank using the neighbor-joining algorithm and the Kimura 2-parameter model of nucleotide substitution. Numbers in parentheses correspond to GenBank accessions. Numbers on branches indicate the bootstrap support after 1,000 pseudoreplicates. The scale bar denotes the number of substitutions per site.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nactivity. The urauchimycins from _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025 presented MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nystatin for _C. albicans_ and _C. glabrata_ (Table 3). Urauchimycin B showed inhibitory activity against all _Candida_ strains evaluated, showing MIC similar to those provided by nystatin.\n\nUrauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity against _Candida_ spp. with MIC values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin, which indicates the potential for medical use. For many years, antimycins were used for the treatment of human infections, but due to its mechanism of action and associated side effects, its use in human treatment was discontinued [47]. However, with the pressing need for new antifungal agents that complement or substitute for the scarce products available on the market, it is interesting and necessary to determine the toxicity presented by urauchimycin B, to assess whether it can be used as an antifungal agent for humans and animals. In addition, evaluation of the isolated compound against _Candida_ species resistant to commercially available antifungal agents should be performed to confirm the potential of this relatively unexplored antifungal.\n\nHere we show that _Trachymymrex_ ants, one attine genus understudied with respect to its microbial symbionts, harbor antimicrobial-producing actinobacteria. As observed by other authors [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33], the present study demonstrates that\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{Isolate ID} & _C. albicans_ & _C. dubliniensis_ & _C. glabrata_ & _C. lrusei_ & _C. parapsilosis_ & _C. tropicalis_ \\\\  & CBS 562 & CBS 7987 & CBS 138 & CBS 573 & CBS 604 & CBS 94 \\\\ \\hline TD016 & * & * & * & * & * & * \\\\ TD017 & * & * & * & * & * & * \\\\ TD018 & * & * & * & * & * & *\n\n## Page 7\n\nactinobacteria of attine ants are able to produce antifungal compounds active against other fungal species and not only against the specific fungal parasite _Escovopsis_.\n\nMoreover, our study corroborates previous work [35] that suggests the attine ant-microbe association is a promising source of microorganisms that produce active metabolites. The few recent studies that focused on the chemical characterization of bioactive compounds produced by actinobacteria associated with attine ants support the potential isolation of novel molecules with biological activity [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Thus, an exploration program of isolation of bioactive molecules from actinobacteria from attine ants certainly will result in the discovery of novel compounds with activity against microorganisms that are potentially pathogenic to humans.\n\n## 4 Conclusion\n\nAs suggested by Poulsen [35], we found that the integument of _Trachymrymex_ ants is a potential source for the isolation of actinobacteria that produce bioactive molecules. The isolation of Urauchimycins A and B enabled, for the first time, the evaluation of their activity against various _Candida_ species. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity and MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nystatin. Toxicity studies and _in vivo_ activity should be carried out in order to verify the potential use of this molecule in the treatment of fungal infections.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo), CNPq/INCT (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico), and NSF IRFP (United States National Science Foundation International Research Fellowship Program no. 07012333) for financial support.

Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All the isolated flavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory activity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nm on MPO. Additionally, the radical-scavenging capacity of flavones 1--6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox(r).\n\nflavone; _Pterogyne nitens_; myeloperoxidase; antioxidant; radical scavenging\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Plant Material\n\nLeaves of _Pterogyne nitens_ were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (SP204319). The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nm on MPO. Additionally, the radical-scavenging capacity of flavones 1--6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox(r).\n\n### Isotal and Purification\n\nThe shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of _P nitens_ were ground and defatted with _n_-hexane (1.81x3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by macroactin with ethanol (2.71x3) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH: H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EOAc and _n_-butanol. After solvent removal using a tetraoperator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1--E11). Chromatographic purification of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH: H2O: AcOH (46:53:0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; flow rate 10 ml/ml] led to the isolation of compounds (1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH: H2O: AcOH (55:44:5.5), UV detection at 274 nm; flow rate 13 ml/ml], affording compound **3** (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identification as compound **5** (130 mg). The butanol fraction (1.8g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1--B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4--B6 were combined (333 mg) and purified by RP-HPLC (MeOH: H2O: AcOH (68:31:5.0), UV detection at 274 nm and flow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds **2** (66 mg) and **4** (89 mg).\n\n### Radical Scavenging Activity (BSA)\n\nAntisodium activity of compounds **1**--6 was determined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS+ [2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as-reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1--6 and positive controls at various concentrations (33.3--1.7 _μ_m) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 _μ_m DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 degC for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS+ was prepared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mm) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mm potassium persulphate (ratio: 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12--16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS+ stock solution was diluted with KH2PO/K2HPO4 (100 mm, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buffer solution (ratio: 1:8). ABTS+ solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds **1--6** and positive controls (0.5--7.0 _μ_m/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical\n\n## Page 2\n\nscavenging activity. Anti-radical abilities against ABTS5+ and DPPH7 species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition=[1(-(Asample/A)x100], where A is test absorbance without sample (only solvent after free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with compounds **1**-**6** or positive controls.\n\n**Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity** Inhibitory effects of 7-me-thoxyflavones **1**-**6** on MPO were evaluated through guaiacolidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 ms) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mx).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiued (70 mm) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample concentrations of compounds **1**--**6** (0.50-50 nm) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibition expressed in concentration-response curves.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nNitensoside A (**1**) was obtained as yellow amorphous powder. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (_a_,_b_-unsaturated C=O), 1606, 1502, 1452 (C=C, aromatic), and a broad band at 1160 cm-1, indicating the presence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These results strongly suggested that compound **1** is a flavonoid glycososide.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two amomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at \\(d\\) 4.92 (1H, d, _J_=7.0 Hz, H-1''), \\(d\\) 4.45 (1H, d, _J_=1.5 Hz, H-1''), \\(d\\) 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a''), \\(d\\) 3.70 (1H, dd, _J_=10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b''), and \\(d\\) 1.04 (1H, d, _J_=6.0 Hz, H-6'') suggested the presence of one _b_-glucopyranosyl and one _a_-thamopyranosyl unit in compound **1**, which was confirmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at \\(d\\) 102.4 (C-1''), \\(d\\) 100.6 (C-1''), \\(d\\) 66.6 (C-6'') and \\(d\\) 17.7 (C-6''). In the aromatic moiety of compound **1**, signals at \\(d\\) 7.96 (2H, d, _J_=8.5 Hz, H-2', 6'), 6.94 (2H, d, _J_=8.5 Hz, H-3', 5'), 6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4'-trihydroxyfluoxyne).17,19) The singlet at \\(d\\) 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the flavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR resonance at \\(d\\) 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton signal at \\(d\\) 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at \\(d\\) 158.7 (C-7) and \\(d\\) 3.90, which confirmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at \\(d\\) 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations confirmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4'-trihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolin+H]+ ion at _m/z_ 301 observed in first-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound **1**. A cross-peak between the signals for\n\nFig. 1: Structures of Compounds **1**—**6\n\n## Page 3\n\nC-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 128.1) and the anomeric proton (\\(\\delta\\) 4.92) in the gHMBC spectrum indicated the position of the glucopyranosyl unit at C-6 of the flavone moiety. Assignment of the inner sugar resonances was achieved by using the anomeric proton resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (\\(J\\)=7.0 Hz) confirmed the \\(\\beta\\)-linkage of the first glucosyl moiety. The downfield shift of C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) (+5.5 ppm) and upfield shift of C-5\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) (-1.4 ppm) glucopyranosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin-6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside [19], indicated that the rhamnopyranosyl moiety was attached at C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\). Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 100.6 (C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 3.70 (H-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) confirmed the C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-\\(O\\)-C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) interglycosidic linkage of compound **1**. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound **1** showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [M\\(-\\)H]\\({}^{-}\\) at 607.1657 \\(m/z\\), in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C\\({}_{23}\\)H\\({}_{31}\\)O\\({}_{15}\\) (607.1657).\n\nCompound **2** was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at \\(m/z\\) 623.1600 (Caled 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C\\({}_{28}\\)H\\({}_{31}\\)O\\({}_{16}\\). The UV and IR spectra of **2** were similar to those of compound **1** suggesting a 6-\\(O\\)-glucosylflavone derivative. The IR of **2** showed a broad hydroxyl band at 3427 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and an \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), in addition to a C-O stretching band at 1045 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of **2** exhibited absorption maxima typical of a flavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H- and \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR data (Table 1) suggested that compound **2** had the same 7-methoxyflavone skeleton as compound **1**, except for the presence of a hydroxy group at C-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\). In fact, the major difference between compounds **1** and **2** was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at \\(\\delta\\) 7.42 (1H, dd, \\(J\\)=8.5, 2.0 Hz, H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\)), \\(\\delta\\) 7.50 (1H, d, \\(J\\)=2.0 Hz, H-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\)), and \\(\\delta\\) 6.88 (1H, d, \\(J\\)=8.5 Hz, H-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\)) for compound **2**. The \\({}^{1}\\)C-NMR spectrum of compound **2** presented 28 signals, deduced from distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\), DEPT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, fifteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quaternary carbons, including one \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated ketone at \\(\\delta\\) 182.1, which confirmed the flavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC correlation of signals at \\(\\delta\\) 158.7 (C-7) and \\(\\delta\\) 3.88 (OMe) in addition to NOESY interaction of signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.88 and \\(\\delta\\) 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at \\(\\delta\\) 128.0 (C-6) and \\(\\delta\\) 4.89 (H-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)), and between signals at \\(\\delta\\) 66.5 (C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 4.43 (H-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-\\(O\\)-C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) interglycosidic linkage in compound **2**. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures of flavones **1** and **2** were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\alpha\\)-rhamnopyranosyl(1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)6\\({}^{\\prime}\\))-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\alpha\\)-rhamnopyranosyl(1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\))-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyflavones were isolated and identified as sorbifolin (**3**) [20], sorbifolin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**4**) [20], pedalitin (**5**) [20], and pedalitin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**6**) [13].\n\nThe antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay [14, 15]. Pedalitin derivatives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin derivatives, probably due to presence of the _ortho_-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity [21, 22]. Pedalitin derivatives **2**, **5** and **6** showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC\\({}_{50}\\) (_m_M) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC\\({}_{50}\\) values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives **1**, **3** and **4** (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the catheed moiety on the B-ring of flavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin derivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (**5**) when compared to its glucosides **2** and **6** in both assays, evidencing the influence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and therefore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference compound quercetin (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 4.12 _m_M), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones [23]. Similarly, this trend has also been observed for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC\\({}_{50}\\) (5.7 _m_M towards ABTS, and 13.5 _m_M towards DPPH) than its 6-\\(O\\)-glucosyl derivatives **1** and **4**, thus confirming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi-calar activity of 7-methoxyflavones.\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of the effects on mammalian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for flavonoids [24], few studies have been devoted to the MPO inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols [25, 26]. MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modifications [16]. The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds **2**, **5** and **6**, displaying a 3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC\\({}_{50}\\) values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 _m_M, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds **1**, **3** and **4**, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides **1**, **2**, **4** and **6** showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between\n\nFig. 2: Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds **1** and **2**\n\n## Page 4\n\nMPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of flavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inflammation derived diseases.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe association of antiradical properties and MPO inhibitory activity observed for flavones **1**--**6**, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated flavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inflammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme involved in inflammatory processes.\n\n## References\n\n- Barnes P., Chung K.

Naturforsch. **57****,** 418-422 (2002); received January 22/February 18, 2002\n\n###### Abstract\n\nThe ethyl acetate extract of roots of _Tephrosia candida_ afforded three new spirorotenoids belonging to a new class of spirocompounds, named tephrospirolactone, tephrospiroketone I, and tephrospiroketone II. The structures of these compounds were determined mainly based on spectral analysis. The only known spirorotenoid described in the literature is amorphiprotonone, isolated from _Amorphi fruitcosa_.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe genus _Tephrosia_ belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is well-known to be a rich source of flavonoids, besides the rotenoids among their secondary metabolites. Rotenoids, an interesting class of compounds showing mainly activity against insects, have also shown powerful ictiotoxic activity, fish poison. Rotenone was the first roenoid identified and had been used as insecticide before the advent of the organosynthetic insecticides (Jacobson, 1971). Recently, properties as anticarcinogenic activities have also been attributed to rotenoids. Tephrosin and amorphiprotonone (**1**) isolated from _Amorphi_ species have shown a potential use against tumours including skin cancer (Konoshima _et al._, 1993 and Li _et al._, 1993).\n\nWe have been interested in the chemistry of _T. candida_ and have described the isolation of rotenoids from this plant (Andrei _et al._, 1997 and Pereira _et al._,1998). In continuation of the study of the roots of _T. candida_ we now describe the isolation and identification of three spirorotenoids, which represent a new spiroclass system formed by the rings B and C, a different spiro system type of amorphiprotonone, the only known spirorotenoid (Li _et al._,1991).\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nA Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and 100.62 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR was used. All spectra were run in CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) and with TMS as internal standard. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter. Mass spectra were obtained with a HP 5987A spectrometer.\n\n### Plant material\n\nRoots of _T. candida_ (Roxb.) DC were collected and identified in the Instituto Agronomico do Parana, PR, Brazil, January 1988. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herbario of Instituto Agronomico, Londrina, PR, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of compounds\n\nThe roots were dried in an open stove at 60 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C and powdered affording 2.7 kg. Exhaustive extraction with ethyl acetate after hexane extraction, gave 36.5 g of crude extract (dry weight). A part of the ethyl acetate extract (8.0 g) was submitted to droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC) using an ascending system obtained from the mixture of the following solvents hexane::CHCl3:CH3CN (10:3:7 v/v/v). A fraction (2275 mg) was submitted to column chromatography (70-230 mesh) eluted with hexane and ethyl acetate with increasing polarity. Purification of the fractions with silica gel columns (230-400 mesh), preparative _tlc_ on silica eluted with hexane:CH2Cl2:MeOH (50:49:1 v/v/v) and recycling preparative HPLC on silica gel using as eluent a mixture hexane:CH2Cl2:-PrOH (80:10:1 v/v/v) afforded tephrospiolactone (**2**)\n\n## Page 2\n\n(7.3 mg), tephrospiroketone \\(I\\) (**3**) (5.2 mg) and tephrospiroketone _II_ (**4**) (1.2 mg).\n\nTephrospiolactone (**2**): [a]b5 +9.5deg (4.5 mg/ml - CH2Cl2).

The absorption 1748 cm-1 was attributed to a carbonyl of an a,b-dihydro-b-lactone ring and the one 1716 cm-1 to the a,b-dehydro-cyclopentanone, while absorptions close to 1680 cm-1, are usually observed for carbonyls of 6a, 12a-dihydrotonoids\n\nThe 1H NMR of the three compounds displayed an AB coupling system for two geminal hydrogens, neighbouring the quaternary carbon of the spirorings (Table I). This system has never been observed before for any rotenoids. Other signals showed to be characteristic of hydrogens in the rings A, D and E, exhibiting differences of the chemical shifts, in comparison with deguelin (**5**) (Andrei _et al._ 1997) and rotenone (**6**) (Birch _et al._ 1985) as models. The chemical shifts observed for H-1 and H-4 in the ring A (Table I) exhibited accentuated differences indicating the presence of an electron withdrawing substituent at the aromatic system. The hydrogens in the D and E rings showed closer chemical shifts when compared with those of the above deguelin and rotenone. The pair of doublets attributed to H-6 in the spirocompounds showed similar chemical shifts with those of the homoisoflawanone scillasscillin (**7**). The diastereotopic protons of this compound (H-2) appear as an AB system, displayed at 8 4.52 and 4.62 (\\(J=11.0\\) Hz) (Heller and Tamm, 1981).\n\nThe 13C NMR chemical shifts were attributed to the carbons of compounds **1**, **2** and **3**, having rotenone (**6**) (Crombie _et al._, 1975) and deguelin (**5**) (Andrei _et al._,1997) as models (Table II). The chemical shifts of C-6a and the additional carbonyl in C-12a of the new compounds have never been described for common rotenoid skeleta before. The data of Table II are in agreement with the proposed structures.\n\nWhen compared with the model compounds the main differences observed were: deshielding of C-3 and C-4a (D ~ 8 ppm), suggesting the addi\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} H & Tephrospiro-lactone (**2**) & Deguelin (**5**) & Tephrospiro-ketone 1 (**3**) & Tephrospiro-ketone II (**4**) & \\\\\n1 & 7.18 \\(s\\) & 6.72 \\(s\\) & 7.27 \\(s\\) & 7.27 \\(s\\) & 6.77 \\(s\\) \\\\\n4 & 6.51 \\(s\\) & 6.38 \\(s\\) & 6.53 \\(s\\) & 6.53 \\(s\\) & 6.46 \\(s\\) \\\\\n6α & 4.54 \\(d\\) (12) & 4.11 \\(d\\) (12.4) & 4.63 \\(d\\) (12.4)\n\n## Page 3\n\ntional withdrawing effect of the conjugated carbonyl at C-12a; C-6 is deshielded (Dd ~ 5 ppm) due to b-effect of the quaternary carbon (6a); C-7a of the spiroketones showed deshielding of 9 ppm due to their presence in a five membered ring; the spirolactone with a six member ring showed a shielding for C-11a (Dd ~ 6.1 ppm) that can be explained by the electron donor effect of the lactone oxygen to C-12 and the chemical shifts for C-7a, C-8, C-9 and C-10 of spiroketones are deshielded in comparison with the models, while C-11 are shielded of 4 ppm in both cases.\n\nThe HMBC spectrum of tephrospiolactone (**2**)(Table III) showed cross peaks between hydrogens and carbons (2\\(J\\) and 3_J_) that confirmed the proposed structure. The main correlation was observed between C-6a and the diasterotopic hydrogens at C-6.\n\nEI/MS also corroborated the structures proposed for the spirocompounds. The spectrum showed two possibilities of a retro Diels-Alder rearrangement. The base peak for **2**, could be explained by a retro Diels-Alder between C and D rings, followed by a common loss of a methyl\n\nFig. 1: Structures of rotenoids amorphispironone (**1**), tephrospiolactone (**2**), tephrospiroketone \\(I\\) (**3**), tephrospiroketone _II_ (**4**), deguelin (**5**), rotenone (**6**) and scillascillin (**7**).\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\ngroup of the chromene ring. Mass spectrum of **3**, also presented the base peak due to the only one retro Diels-Alder type fragmentation.\n\nRotenoid biosynthesis is already well-known (Crombie, 1984 and Crombie and Whitting, 1998). These two last reviews show the main biosynthetic pathways. The biosynthetic pathway for amphiphilic spironne **1**, isolated from _Amorpha fruitcosa_ (Li _et al._, 1991; Terada _et al._,1993) was discussed by Li (1991), and also mentioned by Crombie (1998). For the spiroketones **3** and **4**, a similar first step mechanism with an epoxidation, like in amorphispronone, can be suggested. Therefore, the starting compound should be the 6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin. The epoxidation should occur between C-6a and C-12a. In a hydrate form at C-12 carbonyl, a pinacol-pinacolone type rearrangement could lead to the spiro compounds, after interconversion to the carbonylated form and oxidation of C-12a into a keto group. Subsequent oxidation by a Baeyer-Villiger reaction type at C-12 and expansion to a six membered lactone ring could explain the formation of the spirolactone **2**.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to FAPESP, CNPq, FINEP and CAPES for the financial support, to Alberto S.

Naturforsch. **63c**, 371-382 (2008); received June 18/December 7, 2007Hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, and 34 isolated compounds from _Vitex polygama_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg (Myrtaceae) were screened for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ and _T. brucei_, as well as for their enzymatic inhibitory activities on glycosomal glycerolaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and trypanothione reductase (TR) enzymes from _T. cruzi_ and adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) enzyme from _Leishmania tarentolae_. In general, polar extracts displayed strong effects and some of the tested compounds have shown good results in comparison to positive controls of the bioassays.\n\nMyrtaceae, _Trypanosoma_, _Leishmania_\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg commonly known as Uvatinga belongs to the family Myrtaceae and occurs in grasslands (\"campos rupestres\"), deciduous forests (\"cerradoes\") and gallery forests in Goias, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo States of Brazil. This plant takes part in a genus comprising only nine species; two of them are vulnerable to extinction in Sao Paulo State (Programa Biota FAPESP, 2007) and one species, _S. delicata_, has been recently described (Sobral and Proenca, 2006). _S. densiflora_ has been biologically and chemically researched by our group (Gallo _et al._, 2006a, b, c) since neither data about it could be found in the literature nor popular use has been registered.\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and is commonly called \"Taruma\". Its leaf tea is used in folk medicine to treat kidney infections (Rodrigues, 2001; Gallo _et al._, 2008). Several of its compounds had already been characterized and bioassayed (Leitao _et al._, 1997; Leitao and Delle Monache, 1998; Santos _et al._, 2001; Mensor _et al._, 2001), but none was regarded as neither potential trypanocidal nor enzyme inhibitor.\n\nTrypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a complicated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoan agents.\n\nTrypanosomatids have no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and their bloodstream forms are highly dependent on glycolysis to the stage of pyruvate as sole energy supply. Trypanosome glycoly\n\n## Page 2\n\nsis occurs in a specific microbody called glycosome. Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy necessary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD\\({}^{+}\\) and inorganic phosphate. The _in silico_ modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker _et al._, 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spectridine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb _et al._, 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the \\(N^{1}\\),\\(N^{8}\\)-(bisglutathionyl)-spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S]2) to dihydrotrypanothione (T[SH]2). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S]2) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against trypanosomatids (Hamilton _et al._, 2003).\n\nThe genus _Leishmanita_ owns three enzymes involved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and _a_-D-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into adenosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofuranose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid sequence when compared to corresponding mammalian enzymes, which should allow the development of selective inhibitor compounds.\n\nIn our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ and _T. brucei_. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from _T. cruzi_ or APRT enzyme from _Leishmanita tarentolae_, were assessed.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham.

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), _i. e._, the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentrations, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC50 = 55.5 _m_M).\n\n### _L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activity_\n\nAPRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier described procedures (Thiemann _et al._, 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectrophotometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 _m_L APRT solution. The reaction started by the addition of enzyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira _et al._, 2001).\n\n### _T. cruzi TR inhibitory activity_\n\nEnzyme activity and assay were performed according to prior descriptions (Hamilton _et al._, 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as positive control [IC50 = 2.72 _m_m (personal communication, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC50 value was determined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Imperial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC50 values, and the results were fitted into the equation\n\n\\[\\text{Y} = \\left\\{ {\\text{Range}/\\left[ {1 + (\\text{X}/\\text{IC}_{50})^{\\text{s}}} \\right]} \\right\\} + \\text{Background},\\]\n\nwhere Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in _m_m), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1).\n\n### _T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assay_\n\nBloodstream forms of _T. brucei_, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% serum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of _T. brucei_ was evaluated using the Alamar Blue(r) assay (Raz _et al._, 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 _m_m.\n\n### _T. cruzi cytotoxicity assay_\n\nThe assay was carried out using blood infected with trypanastigotes of _T. cruzi_ \"Y\" strain collected by cardiac puncture in experimentally infected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal murine blood to 2 * 106 trypanastigotes/mL. The assay was performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or compounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 _m_g/mL, 250 _m_g/mL and 100 _m_g/mL. The plates were incubated at 4 degC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC50 = 31 _m_g/mL or 76 _m_M) were run in parallel. The results were expressed as percentage of lysis of trypanastigote forms compared to the DMSO control. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n### _Identification of compounds_\n\nFig. 2 shows the structures of isolated and tested compounds from _S. densiflora_: quercetin **(1)**; quercetin **(2)**; gallic acid **(3)**; aryanbolic acid **(4)**; vanillic acid **(5)**; sitosterol **(6)**; syringic acid **(7)**; 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzoic acid **(8)**; ellagic acid **(9)**; 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde **(10)**; casuarin **(11)**; castalagin **(12)**; ellagic acid 4-_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranoside **(13)**; and from _V. polygamma_: lucolin **(14)**; 3-O-methylquercetin **(15)**; chrysorioenol **(16)**; 3,3'-_O_-dimethylquercetin **(17)**; 3,7,4'-_O_-trimethylkaempferol **(18)**; acacetin **(19)**; isoorientin **(20)**; schaftoside **(21)**; carlinoside **(22)**; penduletin 4'-_O_-methyl ether **(23)**; 2\\(a\\),3_a_-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid **(24)**; oleanolic acid **(25)**; 2\\(a\\),3\\(a\\),19_a_-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid **(26, euscaphic acid); _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid **(27)**; 20-hydroxyec\n\n## Page 6\n\ndysone (**28**, polypodine A); polypodine B (**29**); stachysterone (**30**); shidsterone (**31**); metacrylic acid (**32**); caffeoyl 6-_O_-b_-d-glucopyranoside (**33**); sitosterol 3-_O_-b_-d-glucopyranoside (**34**, daucosterol). The structures of the compounds were elucidated by comparison of their spectral data (1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, HMBC, HSQC, 1H-1H COSY, IE-MS or ESI-MS) with earlier published data (see references in Tables I and II).\n\n### Trypanocidal activity\n\nAmong the 21 extracts and 13 partition fractions tested against trypomastigote forms of _T. cruzi_, 15 revealed significant activities (> 60%, Table III) and were considered as promising sources of active substances.\n\nPartition of VP-HL produced fractions with poorer activities (Table III). 1H NMR analysis of\n\nFig. 2: Structures of compounds isolated from _V. polygamma_ and _S. densiflora._\n\n## Page 7\n\nFig. 2 (continued).\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\nVP-HHL (53%) showed characteristic signals of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. VP-DHL (38%), when submitted to column chromatography, yielded a fraction containing a mixture of steroids which was responsible for 93% of Tc lysis at 500 _m_g/mL (this information is not displayed in the table). VP-EHL (36%) yielded compound **18** (31%), and VP-MHL (52%) afforded compounds **18** and **23** (16%).\n\nVP-DML, after fractionation, afforded compounds **16**, **17**, and a mixture of flavonoids containing quercetin 3-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside and quercetin 4'-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside, which caused 97% Tc lysis at 500 _m_g/L. The same mixture inhibited the gGAPDH activity by 92% at 100 _m_g/mL (this information is not displayed in the table), which may explain the mechanism of action of the mixture on the trypanastigote forms of the parasite. **16** performed a better activity against _T. cruzi_ (33%, Table II) in comparison with compound **14** (27%), indicating that _O_-methylation of the 3'-hydroxy group was important to improve the activity.\n\nVP-BHAL showed a good trypanocidal activity against _T. cruzi_ (60%, Table III), however, the compounds isolated from this fraction did not. Compound **33** (11%, 1.5 mm, Table II) was much less active than its aglycone tested previously (IC50\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} Compound & Extract origin & \\% lysis Tc [mm] & \\% inhibition gGAPDH (200 _μ_M) & \\% inhibition APRT (100 _μ_M) & \\% inhibition TR (100 _μ_M) & Reference inhibition TR (100 _μ_M) \\\\\n**1** & SD-EML & 34 (1.7) & 91a  & 97 & NT & NT & Gallo _et al._, 2006a \\\\\n**2** & SD-EML & 30 (1.1) & 19 & 89 & 4 & I & Gallo _et al._, 2006a \\\\\n**3** & SD-EML & 19 (2.9) & I & I & 5 & I & Gallo _et al._, 2006b \\\\  & SD-MR & & & & & & & \\\\  & SD-MS & & & & & & \\\\\n**4** & SD-MS & 90 (1.0) & I & 13 & NT & NT & Mahato and \\\\  & & 61 (0.5) & & & & & & Kundu, 1994 \\\\\n**5** & SD-MS & NT & I & I & NT & NT & Sakushima _et al._, 1995 \\\\\n**6** & SD-MR & NT & I & I & NT & NT & Gallo _et al._, 2006b \\\\\n**7** & SD-EML & 16 (2.5) & I & I & 14 & I & Gallo _et al._, 2006a \\\\\n**8** & SD-MS & NT & I & 24 & NT & NT & Russel _et al._, 1990 \\\\\n**9** & SD-MR & 41 (1.7) & 90b  & 80 & NT & NT & Gallo _et al._, 2006a \\\\\n**10** & SD-MS & NT & I & I & 46 & I & Kulkarni _et al._, 1989 \\\\\n**11** & SD-MS & 28 (0.5) & c & d & 878 & I & Gallo _et al._, 2006a \\\\  & SD-EML & & & & & & \\\\\n**12** & SD-MS & 11 (0.5) & e & f & 878 & I & Gallo _et al._, 2006a \\\\\n**13** & SD-MS & 12 (1.1) & 86 (239 _μ_M) & NT* & NT & NT & Gallo _et al._, 2006a \\\\  & SD-MR & & 33 (119 _μ_M) & & & & & \\\\  & SD-HAS & & & & & & \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: _In vitro_ antiprotozoal and enzymatic inhibitory activities of compounds from _Siphoeneugena densiflora_.\n\n\n\n## Page 9\n\n2.1 mm, Grael _et al._, 2005), showing that the glycosose moiety, making the molecule more polar, had a bad influence on the biological action.\n\nThe polar extracts from _S. densiflora_ (SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, and SD-HAR, Table III) exhibited a strong effect on _T. cruzi_; on the other hand, compounds isolated from them did not (**3**, **6**, **7**, **9**, **11**, **12** and **13**; Table I).

Eleven of them, the most polar (SD-methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts), showed outcomes above 70% (Table 3), and the majority belonged to _S. densiflora_ (SD). The ascription of such activities to the hydrolysate tannins **11**, **12**, **13**, and ellagic acid (**9**) may be considered due to the low IC50 values accomplished by these compounds (Table 1).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} Extract (obtained amount, g)a  & \\% livis (4 mg/mL) & \\% inhibition gGAPDH (100 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL) & \\% inhibition APRT (50 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL) \\\\ SD-HL (8.2) & 82 & 28 & NT \\\\ SD-ML (164.8) & 34 & 74 & 97 \\\\ SD-DML (9.5) & NT & NT & 30 \\\\ SD-EML (14.6) & NT & 90 & 73 \\\\ SD-BML (12.0) & NT & NT & 68 \\\\ SD-AML (12.5) & NT & NT & 75 \\\\ SD-HAL (22.1) & 49 & 82 & NT* \\\\ SD-HS (0.9) & 65 & I & 14 \\\\ SD-MS (177.6) & 47 & 91 & NT* \\\\ SD-HAS (5.5) & 100 & 93 & NT* \\\\ SD-HT (1.0) & 33 & I & 30 \\\\ SD-MT (131.1) & 83 & 94 & 28 \\\\ SD-HAT (5.7) & 100 & 92 & 73 \\\\ SD-HR (0.3) & 64 & 26 & 4 \\\\ SD-MR (73.2) & 88 & 92 & NT* \\\\ SD-HAR (2.4) & 61 & 94 & NT* \\\\ VP-HL (5.1) & 94 & NT & NT \\\\ VP-HHL (1.08) & 53 & I & NT \\\\ VP-DHL (1.84) & 38 & I & NT \\\\ VP-EHL (1.94) & 36 & 22 & NT \\\\ VP-MHL (0.19) & 52 & I & NT \\\\ VP-ML (40.4) & 58 & 3 & NT \\\\ VP-DML (15.1) & NT & NT & 74 \\\\ VP-EML (8.0) & NT & NT & 62 \\\\ VP-HAL (31.0) & 41 & 81 & NT \\\\ VP-EHAL (2.2) & 62 & I & 56 \\\\ VP-BHAL (12.8) & 60 & I & 67 \\\\ VP-AHAL (22.6) & 40 & 76 & NT \\\\ VP-HT (0.85) & 75 & I & NT \\\\ VP-MT (19.3) & 28 & I & NT \\\\ VP-EMT (3.9) & NT & NT & 51 \\\\ VP-DMT (2.6) & NT & NT & 52 \\\\ VP-HAT (2.3) & 81 & 39 & NT \\\\ VP-HF (1.1) & 80 & I & NT \\\\ VP-MF (2.0) & 80 & NT & 26 \\\\ VP-HAF (0.9) & 39 & NT & NT \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: _In vitro_ antiprotozoan and enzymatic inhibitory activities of _Siphoneugena densiflora_ (SD) and _Vitex polygamma_ (VP) extracts and fractions.\n\n\n\n## Page 11\n\nAmong the flavonoids, the simple and highly oxidized flavonol quercetin (**1**) was the most active. The flavone luteolin (**14**), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduction of the methoxy group at position C-3 (**15**) or C-3' (**16**), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested enzymes (for comparison, see activities of compounds **17**, **18** and **23** in Table II). The _O_-glycosylated flavonoid quercetin (**2**) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone **1**. Lio _et al._ (1985) observed the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activities also performed by compounds **21** and **22** (Table II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I and II). An unseparated mixture of lupool, _a_-amyrin and _b_-amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from _S. densiflora_ (SD-DML), tested at 200 _m_m, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentration, a mixture of compound **24** and its isomer _2a_,3_b_-dihydroxy-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound **24** inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II).\n\n### APRT inhibition\n\nFrom 17 extracts and subfractions tested, eight presented results greater than 60%. Several could not be screened because they absorbed at the same wavelength used in the bioassay. The activity of the methanolic extract from leaves of _S. densiflora_ was increased after fractionation (from 74 to 90%, Table I). Furthermore, quercetin (**1**) as well as quercetin (**2**), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD-EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had activities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I and II). When analyzing the results displayed by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hydroxy groups. Accordingly, compound **29**, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to **28** and two in relation to **30**, was twice more active than **28** and seven times more than **30** (Table II).\n\n### TR inhibition\n\nAll tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (**11**) and castalagin (**12**) which performed an IC50 value of 179.3 _m_m on enzyme inhibition, although this result is not promising in comparison with clomipramine, the positive control.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. Marcos Sobral (UFMG) and Fatima Regina Salimena-Pires (UFJF) for botanical identifications, to ALCOA Aluminio S/A for facilitating the plant collections, to Ahilan Saravanamuthu for supplying TR enzyme, and to Dr. John Lee Richardson for valuable discussions.

St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani (Rutaceae) afforded new pyranoflavones along with the known compounds flavone, 7-methoxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, haplostusine, 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone alkaloid, b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and b-sitosterol benzoate. Their structures were established based on their spectral data. NMR data for the alkaloid INDIAMINA and the new pyranoflavones are described for the first time herein. These compounds were assayed on the tripmonsatiqute forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Among them, haplotusine and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone showed moderate values of IC50 136.9 and 144.9 uM, respectively.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nA doenca de Chagas, causada pelo protozoario _Trypanosoma cruzi_, e uma das mais graves endemias do Brasil. No Continente Americano, ela afeta 16-18 milhoes de individuos, sendo que 100 milhoes estao sob risco de contaminaacao.1\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nDevido a ampla distribuicao geografica desta doenca, a falta de tratamento eficza e seguro, e as graves manifestacoes clinicalas que ocasiona, a procura de novas substancias para a profilaxia e/ou tratamento desta emelia se faz necessaria.\n\nNeste contexto, as plantas sao valiosas fontes de novos compostos ativos e com baxica toxicidade.2 De fato, segundo un levantamento recente, 61% dos 877 novos farmacos desenvolvidos durante o periodo de 1981-2002 sao produtos naturais, ou substancias desenvolvidas a partir deles.3\n\nDe plantas da familia Rutaceae foram isolados alcaloides e lignanas com attividades triangucidas.4,5 Alem disso, as attividades sobre o _T. cruzi_ ou sobre sua enzima GAPDH (gliceraldedo 3-fosfatosdicofragase) de varios extratos e algumas substancias isoladas desta mesma familia foram determinadas.6,8\n\nFootnote 4: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nA especie _Conchocarpus heterophyllus_ (A. St.-Hil.) pertence a familia Rutaceae (ordem Rutales) e era anteriormente denominada de _Angostura heterophylla_ (A. St.-Hil.) Alb.9 Nenhum estudo fitoquimico sobre o genero cesorito na literatura. Erratumo, do genero _Angostura_ form isolados alcaloides acridonicos.10\n\nOs extratos e as fracoes de folhas e cuale de _C. heterophyllus_ apresentaram atividade sobre as formas tripmonsatigotas do _T. cruzi_.6 Neste trabalho sao descritos o isolamento, as atividades tripanocidas substancias obtidas de tais extratos/fracoes, assim como os dados de RMN do alcaloide haplotusina (**I**) e das piranoflavonas ineditas (**2**).\n\nFootnote 6: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\n## RESULTSADO\n\nO estudo quimico dos extratos e fracoes de folhas e cuale de _C. heterophyllus_, attivos sobre as formas tripmonstigotas de _T. cruzi_, permitu o isolamento de steroides, flavonas e alcaloides 2- e 4-quinolonics. A partir do extrato hexanico do caule de _C. heterophyllus_ foram isolados os esteroides b-sitosterol e estigmasterol;11 da fracao dicidomentaica proveniente de extrato hexanico das folhas, o benzoate de b-sitosterida12 e uma mistura de piranoflavonas ineditas (**2**) da fracao acetato de e tella deste mesmo extrato, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona3 e 5-hidrofilavona;4 de falrao acetato de e tella do extrato metanolico do caule, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona, haplotusina (**1**)15 e o alcaloide 2-fenil-1-metil-4-quinolona (**3**).16\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nTodas as substancias foram identificadas atraves da analise dos seus datos espectivocpicos e comparação com os da literatura. A mistura de piranoflavonas (**2**) esta sendo descrita pela primeira vez\n\nFigure 1: Substancias obtidas de Conchocarpus heterophylus\n\n## Page 2\n\nna literatura e as demais substancias, no genero _Conchocarpus_. Entretanto, os dados de RMN para o alcaloide haplottusina (**1**) nao estavam desritos.15\n\nFootnote 15: The _H_-H_ and _H_-H\n\n## Page 3\n\nces. Os resultados (Tabela 4) morsam que dentre as substancias testadas, as mais ativas foram os alcaloides **1 c 3**, apresentando valores de IC\\({}_{50}\\) de 136,9 e 144,9 uM, respectivamente. Entretanto, as substancias testadas nao mostraram ser potentes agentes tripancidas, principalmente quando comparadas ao quimio-profilatico violeta de genciana, cujo IC\\({}_{50}\\) de 83 uM, e com a lignana (-)-metilbrivatolideo, que na concentracao de 67,5 uM ocasionou 99% de lies parasitiaria.4\n\nApesar desste fato, os resultados dos testes tripancidas superram que as substancias isoladas podem ser os principios ativos das fracoes e extratos de _C. heterophylilus_, que foram attivos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do _T. cruzi.6_\n\nFootnote 4: A 30\n\n## Page 4\n\nrealizada segundo a tecnica descrita por Brener.19 Como controles, foram utilizados sangue de camundongo infectado, sem a adicao de nenhuma substancia; sangue infectado contendo a mesma concentracao de DMSO utilizada no preparo das solucoes e, sangue infectado contendo violeta de genciana (controle positivo), na contenracao de 1:4.000.\n\nAs substancias foram ensaiadas nas concentracoes de 500, 250 e 100 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL, para a obtencao dos valores de IC\\({}_{50}\\).\n\n## References\n\n* (1) Dias, J.

Phtyochemical investigation of the fruits extracts of _Trichilia elegans_ and _Trichilia catigua_ (Meliaceaee) has led to the identification of the limonoids 11b-acetoxybacunone, ecdrelone, methylangelonate and epimeric mixture of photogedunin besides known cameras (scoparone, scopoletin, umbeliferone) and the steroids stigmasterol, b-sitosterol, istostenone and campstered. The structures of the compounds were proposed by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data. An evaluation of the insecticidal activity of the fruits extracts of _Trichilia_ ssp. was carried out and the extracts of _T. elegans_ revealed to have strong insecticidal activity and the extracts of _T. catigua_ showed moderate larval mortality on _Spodoptera frugiperda_.\n\nKeywords: _Trichilia_; limonoids; _Spodoptera frugiperda_.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nO uso de plantas com propriedades insecticides tem se mostrado uma promissora ferramenta no controle de insectos, por causar menor impacto ambiental, o que attende aos anseios da sociedade moderna.1 Detre as especies utilizadas como insecticida, a nim, _Azadirachta indica_ (Meliaceae), e a popularmente mais conhecida e cujo espectro de acao e bastante amplo, tendo sueh efito comprovado sobre aproximadamente 400 especies de insectos.2 A partir dos excelentes resultados verificados com o nim, outras meliacas tambem passaram a despertar o interesse de pesquisadores, no intuito de encontroar novas especies e novas moleculas com atividade inesticida, vias especies de Meliaceae se destacam entre as familias botanica s que apresentam ingredienties attivos com atividade inesticida, proporcionando eficiencia de seus extractos.3 O genero _Trichilia e_ um deles, pois alem de apresentar compostos com atividade insecticidea conhecida (triquilinas),4 c bastante abundante nas regioes tropiciais da America com mais de 230 especies conhecidas.5\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dq.ufscar.br\n\nMikolajczak e Reed+ realizaram um dos primeiros trabalhos testando a atividade inesticida de _Trichilia_ sobre _S. frugiperda_. Os extratos etanolicos de _T. pallida_, _T. comoroides_, _T. prieureana_, _T. roka_ e. _T. triphyllaria_ testados causaram mortalidade igual ou superior a 80% das lagarts, sendo que apenas a diltima especia nao efeto a sobrevivencia o aloseto. Diversos trabalhos comprovando atividade insecticide de _Trichilia_ ssp. sobre _Spodoptera frugiperda_ tem sido realizados.17,8 Atividade biologica sobre insetso de algmus limonoides isolados de especies de _Trichilia_ ven sendo investigada, e resultados promissores foram encontrados.49-11\n\nFootnote †: e-mail: paulo@dq.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAs separacoes cromatograficas em colunas foram realizadas utilizando-se gel de silica 60, 70-230, 230-400 mesh e Sephadex LH-20. As separacoes oper comatografia liquida de alta eficiencia (CLAE) em condicoes preparativas foram realizadas em coluna Asaibnak GS-310 2G (2,15 x 50,0 cm), utilizando equipamento Shimadzu LC-8A com valivula de reciclo, injector Rheodyne 7123 com _loop_ 500 \\(\\mu\\)L e detector UV/VIS Shimadzu SPD-6AV.\n\nAs analises cromatograficas em camada fina foram realizadas em cromatoplacas de silica gel F235 sobre placa de aluminio Merck, de 0.2 mm de espessum, empregado-se como revelador a solucao de vanilina/acido sulfurico.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nOs frutos de _T. elegans_ e _T. catiqua_ foram coletados em Piracica-ba/SP no Campus da Escola Superior de Agricultura \"Luiz de Queiroz\" (Esala/USP) e identificados pelo botanico Dr. Ricardo Ribeiro Rodriguez Rodriguez. Uma exsicata de _T. elegans_ e outra de _T. catiqua_ foram depositadas sob os numeros 80407 e 7394, respectivamente.\n\n## Preparacao dos extratos\n\nOs frutos secos (84,0 g) e modios de _T. elegans_ foram extrados a temperatura ambiente e em repouso, com solventes em ordem crescente de polaridade (hexano, MeOH e MeOH/agua 1:1). As solucoes obtidas foram concentradas por destilaaco do solvente em evaporador rotativo, formecendo extratos hexanico, metamolico e indrometanolico. Os frutos de _T. catiqua_ foram separados em arilo (3,5 g), semente (8,0 g) e exocarpo (3,0 g) e, posteriormente, secos e modos. A extracao das partes dos frutos de _T. catiqua_ foi realizada utilizando as mesmas condicoes descritas para os frutos de _T. elegans_. Os extratos foram submetidos a ensaios biologicos sobre a lagarta-do-carutcho _S. frugiperda_ e os que apresentaram attividade foram fracionados.\n\n## Isolamento das substancias de _T. elegans_\n\nO extrato hexanico dos frutos de _T. elegans_ (4,20 g) foi submetido a cromatografia em coluna liquida a vacuo empactodan com silica gel (230-400 mesh), utilizando-se como fases moveis solvents organicos de polaridade crescente: hexano, hexano/AcOE1 9:1; AcOEte MeOH. Foram obtidas 4 fracoes apos evaporacao dos solventes organicos: FHI = 20 mg; FH2 = 2800 mg; FH3 = 970 mg e FH4 = 245 mg. A fracao FH3 foi submetida a varios fractionamentos em coluna de sslica gel (70-230 mesh), eluida com CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0-50,0%); MeOH), em gradiente de polaridade crescente formecendo as substancias **1** (1,0 mg), **2** (1,0 mg), **3** (1,6 mg) e a mistura dos esteroides (8,0 mg).\n\nO extrato metamolico dos frutos de _T. elegans_ (5,20 g) foi suspenso em una mistura MeOH/H2O e particionado sucessivamente com CH2Cl2, AcOE1 e _n_-BuOH. Foram obtidas 3 fracoes apos\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & & & & & & Mortalidade da fase larval (\\%) \\\\  & & Controle & Hexánico & Metanólico & Hidrometanólico \\\\ _T. catiqua_ & Sementes & 6,67 & 56,67 & 43,33 & 53,33 \\\\  & Arilo & 6,67 & NT & 10,00 & 13,33 \\\\  & Exocarpo & 6,67 & 13,33 & 13,33 & 23,33 \\\\ _T. elegans_ & Frutos & 10,00 & 100,00 & 100,00 & 33,33 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Mortalidade da fase larval de _S. frugiperda_ alimentada com dieta artificial tratada com extratos de _Trichilia_ spp., a 1000 mg kg−1\n\n## Page 3\n\nOs extratos hexanico e metanolico de frutos de _T. elegans_ aperentaran mortalidade similar no extrato quaquos das semetenes de _Azadirachta indica_ sobre larvas de _S. exempla_, demonstrando ser um poderoso insecticide.14 Uma alta taxa de mortalidade representa uma dastividades insecticides mais efciencias, j4 que atua logo nas primeiras fases da praga, diminuindo seu ataque na cultura e contribuindo para o decrescimo das populacoes subequentes. Assim, o estudo deste extrato e de suma importancia, seja na sua forma bruta ou visando o isolamento de seus constitutites quimicos.\n\nAo se fracionar o extrato metanolico de frutos de _T. elegans_ forman isoladas as cumarinas (**1-3**) e o limoniodic (**4**), de extrato hexanico foram isoladas as mesmas cumarinas e os esteroides. Ha an literatura relatos de atividade antialimentar de furanocumarinas sobre _S. exigua_16 e _S. litura_.17\n\nApesar da baixa atividade inseticida do extrato metanolico do arila de _T. catigua_ (10%, Tabela 1) este fori fracionado e foi possivel isolar os limonoides cedrelona (**5**), angolensato de metila (**6**) e a mistura epimercia de fotogeluma (**7 e 8**).\n\nO estudo quimico do extrato hexanico dos frutos de _T. elegans_ resultou no isolamento e identificacao das cumarinas escoporona (**1**), escopoletina (**2**), umbeliferena (**3**) e na identificacao da mistura dos esteroides: b-sitosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol eistenon-na. As estruturas das cumarinas escoporona (**1**), escopoletina (**2**), umbeliferena (**3**) foram elucidadas com base nas andiseles dos dados de EM, RMN 1H 1C, alema comparacao com dados publicados anteriormente.18 A mistura dos esteroides foi identificataravdes de analises por CG-EM, comparando-se os espectros de massas obtidos com os espectros existentes no banco de dados de equipamento, por RMN 1H e 13C e tambem por comparacao com dados da literatura.19 O cromatograma de ions totais da analise por CG-EM apresentou 4 picos. O espectro de massas dos picos correspondentes apresentou ions mnoleculares em _m/z_ 414, 412, 400 e 412, concordantes com os espectros de massas do istosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol e sitostenona, respectivamente, sendo o esterolde sitostenorol o composto majoritario desta mistura.\n\nA fracao de _T. elegans_ em AcOEt, resultante da particao do extrato metanolico dos frutos formeceu o limonoide 11b-acetoikonaconna (**4**) cuja estrutura foi caracterizada atraves de dados formecidos pelo espectros de RMN 1H e 13C 1D e 2D (HSQC, HMBC, Tabela 2), envolvendo comparacoes com dados descritos na literatura13,30 para compostos com estrutas semelinantes de imionode (**4**). Esta a primeira vez que os dados de RMN 1H e 13C de limonodice 11b-acetoikonaconna (**4**) esta escho apresentados. No espectro de RMN 1H da substancia **4** form observados sinas em 8 7,40-7,42 (m, H-21 e H-23) e 6,35 (s, H-22) ppm caracteristicos do enel furano. As atribucoes dos C-20 (d 119,5), C-21 (d 141,1), C-22 (d 109,6) e C-23 (d 143,3) doa el furano foram realizadas atraves de RMN 1C e confirmadas atraves do mapa de correlacoes HSQC e HMBC.

The **1**-**6** were evaluated against the fungi C. _cladsosporioides_ and _C. spharosospermum_ and only **5** showed weak activity. The cytotoxicity _in vitro_ against HeLa and CHO cells lines were investigated and the cytochalasins **2-4**, and **6** showed a strong activity against HeLa. The DNAdamaging activity of **1**-**6** were also investigated against mutant strains of _S. cerevisiae_.\n\n**Keywords: _Xylaria_ sp.; _Piper aduncum_; endophytic fungus.\n\n**INTRODUCAO**\n\nAproximadamente um quarto de todos os produtos naturais biologicamente attivos conhecidos tem sido produzidos por fungos.1 Estes sao estimados em 1,5 milhoes de especies2 distribuidos principalmente entre fungos micoparasitas, coprofilos, de solo, de agua docc, epifiticos e endofificos. Fungos endofificos sao microorganisms que habitam o interior de um vegetal,1 em pelo menos por un periodo de seu cicio de vida. Apesar de seren productores de metabolites secundarios biologicamente attivos,4 sao pouco explorados.\n\nDando continuidade aos estudos de prospeccao quimica e biologica em fungos endofificos isolados de especies vegetais do cerrado, a espeice vegetal _Piper aduncum_ foi selecionada, pois a medicina popular relata proprietades diuretica, cicatrizante e anti-hemorradiecia.5.7 Dados fittopuimicos de _P. aduncum_ relata a coornercia de amidas, fenilproponoides, di-hidrochalcanos e derivados prenilados com atividades moluscida, bactericida e citotoxica.89 Estes fatos, associados as observacoes de que micro-organismos endofificos podem mimetizar a quimica de seus respectivos hospedeiros e produzirem substancias ou derivados com maior bioatividade,10 direcionaram o estudo quimico/biologico dos fungos endofificos associados a _P. aduncum_.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\ncom C-7 (d2 212,6) e comparacao com dados de citocalas-13(E),19(E)-dien-1,7,17-triona, 1possibilitarum a elucidacao do nucleo isiondolona. As correlacao e de H-22 (d8 1, 1,12) e H-23 (d8 1, 1,44) com C-17 (d2 214,9) e entre H-21 (d8 5, 43) e C-8 (d5 5, 12,2) e comparacao com 19,20-epoxico citocalasina C (3)3 (perimentiumelacao) and amercolico.\n\nAs configuracoes relativas do nucleo isiondolona e do anel macrociccico de **1** form estabelecidas pelo experimento NOESY, onde se observon correlacao entre H-4 e H-21, valores dos descendemo atomicos de RMN de 'H 'C, constantes de acoplamento e comparacao com 18,21-di-hidroix-16,18-dimetti-10-fenil-citolasas-13(E),19(E)-dieno-1,7,17-triona? e com 19,20-epoxicoitocalasina C (**3**),15 respectivamente, Figure 1. Estas informacoes permitam estabelecer a configuracao relativa da inedita citocalasina **1**.\n\nAs substancias **2-6** form identificadas pela analise por EM, RMN de 'H e '1C, gHMQC, gHMQC, gGOSY e NOESY e por comparacao com dados descritros na literatura.13\n\nAs citocalasinas **1-6** (Figure 1) foram availadas quanto atividade antifinicas, frente aos fungos ftopologicos _Cladosporium clados-poioides e C. sphaerospermum_, usando-se o metodo da autoibografia direta.14 A substancia **5** movetu uma fraca atividade na concentracao de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrao nistatina (1 mg mL 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentarum-se inativas.\n\nAs substancias **1-6** form ensaiadas frente a linhagem mutante de _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica nao serem as responsaveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15\n\nA avaliacao da attividade citorakica de **1-6** foi realizada em celulas de maniforacos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cervix humano) e CHO (ovario de hamster chines).16 Para a linhagem aao cancergerica CHO, as substancias **2**, **3**, **5** e **6** apresentam IC50, de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As ciocalasinas **1** e **4** nao apresentaram IC50 nas concentracoes testadas, sendo que **1** foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada com padrao com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1.\n\nNa linhagem cancerigena HeLa as substancias **1-6** apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente. A cisplatina foi usada com padrao com IC50 = 5,0 mmol L-1.\n\nA forte attividade apresentada pelas citocalasinas **2-5** contra a linhagem canerigena HeLa e a fraca contra a linhagen nao cancergica CHO evidenciam uma seletividade destas substancias para as infagens tumorais HeLa.\n\nPara o nosso conhecimento, este e o primeiro relato de citocalasinas sendo produzidas por fungos endofificos associados a _Piper aduncum_.\n\n## Parte Experimental\n\n### Instrumentacao\n\nOs espectros de absorcao na regiao do IV foram obtidos em um espectometro Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectometro de massas de baixa resolucao da marca Fisons, modelo VG Platform II, no modo de ionizacao _electrospray_ (ESI). Os espectros\n\nFigure 1: _Estruturas das substancias isoladas de Xylaria sp._\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nde massas de alta resolucao foram obtidos em espectrometro QTOF (Micromass), utilizando-se como metodo de ionizacao _electrospray_ no mode positivo.\n\nOs espectors de RMN form registrados em CDCli e DMSO-_d__o_ no espectrometro Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrao de referencia.\n\nO aparello de cromatografia liquida de alta efciencia (CLAE) foi um Varian Pro Star, com detectores UV-Vis. As columas analiticas e preparativas utilizadas foram Phenomenex tipo Luna - C18 (250 x 4.60 mm, 5 mm) e (250 x 21,20 mm, 10 mm), respectivamente.\n\nOs meios de cultura liquido e solido foram submetiods a esteriliaz zacao em autoclave a 121 degC e 1 atm de pressao por 20 min.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nFolhas saudaveis de _Piper aduncum_ foram coletadas na Casa Vegetacao do Instituto de Quimica - UNESP- Araraquara em maio de 2001.\n\n## Isolamento dos fungos endofticos\n\nAs folhas coletadas foram lavadas com agua e sabao, a seguir esteriliazas por imersao em NaClO (1%) por 5 min, seguido de etanol 70% por 1 min e lavadas com agua esteriliazada 2 vezes por 10 min, 1/32/ As folhas esteriliazadas foram assepicamente seccionadas em segmentos de 1 cm2 aproximadamente e colocados em placa de Petri, contendo o meio de cultura bata dextrose agar (PDA), marca Difco, preparado na concentracao de 39 g/L, acrescido do antibiotico sulfato de gentamicina e incubado a 25 degC. O crescimento dos fungos f orio monitorado diariamente e, apos cada cultura atingir de 1-2 cm em diametro, foram submetiods a successivas repicacas e detbencao das linagens puras. Forma obtidas ese linagenes puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Quimica Organica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como _Xylaria_ sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Colecao Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292.\n\n## Cultivo em meio liquido e obtencao dos extratos brutos\n\nO fungo endofittico _Xylaria_ sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 das. A seguir foi inculado em 20 fixesos de Erlenmeyer s (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentracao de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantios em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 degC por 28 das. Apos este periodo o caldo foi separado do micelio por filtarxio, extradao com ACoEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extrado com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fracao CHCl, (0,7 g).\n\n## Isolamento das citocalasins\n\nA fracao CHCl, (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de silica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco fracoes: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1). Estas foram analisadas por CLAE-DAD (Si C-18, gradiente H2O:CH,CN 5 a 100% de CH,CN, 40 min, fluxo de 1 mL/min), sendo detectada una alta concentracao de citocalasana no faxica pA-01-3.\n\nA fracao PA-01-3 foi submetada a CLAE-prep em fase reversa [A = 220 nm, 10 mL/min CH3CN:H2O (68:32)], resultando nas cito-calasinas **1** (5,5 mg, t8 = 71 min), **2** (17,5 mg, t8 = 32 min), **3** (30,0 mg, tk = 54 min), **4** (15,0 mg, tk = 26 min), **5\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n**Determinacao da viabilidade celular**\n\nPara a determinacao da ciotoxicidade das citocalasinas **1-6**, foram utilizadas as linhagens de celulas de mmiferos HeLa (tumor de cervix humano) e CHO (ovario de hamster chinos) na densidade de 2 x 10\\({}^{4}\\) celulas pocos\".

As fracoes form monitoradas via RMN 'H e ESI-EM/EM e foram analisadas somente aquelas eujos espectros apresentavam caracteristicas de alcaloides do acido antranfilico e flavonoides nao isolados anteriormente. Foram isolados do caule os alcaloides flindersina, skimminaina, 8-metoxifillersina e dictamnina; das folhas os flavonoides 3',4',7,8-tetrametoxi-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimtiplirano)-flavona, 3',4',5,7,8-pentametoxiflavona, 5-hidroxi-3',4',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona, 3',4'-metilendiodioxi-5,6,7-trimetoxiflavona e-3',4'-metilendiodioxi-6,7-dimetoxiflavona., Os alcaloides do acido antranfilico nao foram encentrodas em deza.\n\nVarios flavonoides isolados de N. paracensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, enxerto de _Citrus sinensis_ (Rutaceae) e _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) forum testados frente a gliceraldehyde-3-fosfato desidrogenase de _Trypamosoma cruzi_, visando verificar seus potenciais em inibir a attividade da enzima. Os flavonoides polimetoxidados e um isoflavononide foram os mais attivos.\n\nOur taxonomic interest in the _Neoraputia_ stimulated an investigation of _N. paraensis_ searching for alkaloids. Fractions were monitored by 'H NMR and ESI-MS/MS and only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. Stems afforded the alkaloids finderine, skimminaine, 8-metohydroylindersine and dictamine; leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethylo-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone, 3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethyloflavone, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years.\n\nA number of flavonoids isolated from _N. paraensis_, _N. magnifica_, _Murraya paniculata_, _Citrus sinensis_ graft (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Highly oxygenated flavones and isoflavone were the most actives.\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Neoraputia_ species were originally described by Engler as species of _Raputia_ Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus _Neoraputia_ Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them from _Raputia_ and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae.1 Previous investigations of _Neoraputia_ reported the presence of eleven polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavones, one 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone and one flavanone from _N. alba_ (Engler) Emmerich;23 five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6-pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-polymethoxylated chalcones from _N.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nmagnifica_ var. _magnifica_ (Engler) Emmerich;4,5 ten polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavones and one 6-(3\"-hydroxy.3\"-methyl-\\(trans\\)-but-1\"-enyl)-flavone from _N. paraensis_.6,7 All phytochemical studies on _Neoraputia_ genus have been undertaken in our laboratory and by Arruda _et al_.6,7, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. If Emmerich'proposal is correct, that _Neoraputia_ is a Cusparieae member, then this genus can be regarded as a potential source of anthranilate alkaloids. Thus, it would be not surprising if anthranilate alkaloids had remained undiscovered in the _Neoraputia_ because of their low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove _Neoraputia_ to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated flavones.4,8 Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of _Neoraputia_ species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. In order to establish this we have now undertaken a further investigation of _N. paraensis_.\n\nChagas' disease, caused by the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organisation). Control of the insect vector (_Triatoma infestans_) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side effects.9 The bloodstream form of the parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_ has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production.9 This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined.9 Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with significant differences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested.9\n\nHighly oxygenated flavones from _Neoraputia_\\(magnifica\\) have shown to be the most actives as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor.5 These data stimulated an investigation of other flavonoids. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, flavonoids isolated from _Neoraputia_\\(paraensis\\), _N. magnifica_, _Murraya paniculata_, _Citrus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus_ (Leguminosae) were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from _Trypanosoma cruzi_.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nOur taxonomic interest in the _Neoraputia_ stimulated an investigation of the extracts from stems and leaves of _N. paraensis_ searching for alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff's reagent on TLC plates. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations.\n\nThe dichloromethane extract from stems afforded only the alkaloid flindserine (**1**).10 The HSQC and HMBC experiments on flindserine, permitted minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments.10 Table 1 shows that the signals for C-3 and C-10 to C-12 were reassigned. The observed correlations between the methine hydrogen signal at d 6.77 and the 13C signals at d 162.5, 157.3 and 79.1 led to their assignments as C-2, C-4, C-13, respectively. The upfield methine hydrogen signal at d 5.56 showed correlation with the 13C signals at d 105.8, 79.1 and 26.3 permitting the assignment of these signals to C-3, C-13 and C-14/15, respectively. The signals at d 6.77 and 5.56 were then assigned to H-11 and H-12, respectively.\n\nThe methanolic extract from stems afforded skimminanine,11 8-methoxyfildersine (**2**)12 and dictamine.13,14 As no carbon shifts of **2** could be found in the literature, these data are listed in Table 1. Complete and unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for **2** were made using the HSQC and HMBC techniques and using **1** and haplophytin A (**3**)15 as a models. The methine hydrogen signal at d 6.71 showed correlation with the 13C signals at d 157.1 permitting the assignment of these signals to H-11 and C-4. Thus, in compound **1** and **2**, H-11 is more deshielded than H-12. However, in model **3** the presence of the methoxyl at C-5 caused downfield shift of the usual range for 4,O-3-chromene quinolines, resulting in the H-12 being more deshielded than H-11. The methoxyl at C-5 also induces effects on C-10 and C-3, exhibiting upfield displacement for C-10 and downfield displacement for C-3. These data were also confirmed by HMBC experiments.15\n\nThe _n_-hexane extract of the leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethyl-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone3 (**4**) which has not been recorded from _N. paraensis_. The dichloromethane extract from leaves gave four flavonoids,\n\n## Page 3\n\n3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone16 (**5**), 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethyl flavone17 (**6**), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone5 (**7**) and **8**, which are reported for the first time from _N. paraensis_, while the latter appears to be new.\n\nThe flavone **8** exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 'H NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3',4'-substitution (\\(\\delta\\) 7.33, d, \\(J\\) 1.8 Hz, H-2'; \\(\\delta\\) 6.93, d, \\(J\\) 8.2 Hz, H-5'; \\(\\delta\\) 7.46, dd, \\(J\\) 8.2 and 1.8 Hz, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for two methoxy groups (\\(\\delta\\) 3.97, s; 3.92, s), one methylenedioxy group (\\(\\delta\\) 6.08, s, 2H), one hydroxyl group at \\(\\delta\\) 12.73 (1H, s, OH-5) and two singlets at \\(\\delta\\) 6.54 (H-8) and 6.55 (H-3) indicating the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted and a flavone nucleus. The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)17 fragments in ESI-MS/MS of this flavone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B-rings. Thus, a combination of 'H NMR data and the fragment ions at _m/z_ 146 (30%) and 181 (RDA-Me, 100%) fully supported the presence of 3',4'-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy or 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-OH-7,8- and 5-OH-6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-OH-3,7,8- and 5-OH-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavonol indicated that C-6 methine (_ca._\\(\\delta\\) 96) resonates at lowerfield than C-8 methine (_ca._\\(\\delta\\) 91).18 Thus,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} Atom & \\(\\mathbf{8^{\\rm a}}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{9^{\\rm a}}\\).18 & \\(\\mathbf{10^{\\rm b}}\\).5 \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) (_J_) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) & \\(\n\n## Page 4\n\nthe correct A-ring was decided on the basis of 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which showed signal at d 90.6 for C-8, so placing the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-6. From these data **8** was characterised as 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone (**9**)18 and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone (**10**).5\n\nPreliminary work was firstly undertaken on specimens collected in Paragominas, state of Para, north of Brazil, in February 1991.6,7 The present results obtained from specimens originating from Uruyuca, Bahia (February 1993), showed that there was no difference in the flavonoids between the two collections. However, alkaloids were obtained only from plants of northeast region (Bahia), which is characterized by drought summer, compared to rainy summer in the northern (Para). In contrast, _Neoraputia alba_ and _N. magnifica_ collected in Espirito Santo, near northeast of Brazil, had only high concentration of flavonoids. Thus, geographic-variation do not seem to be an important environmental factor. The low concentration of anthranilate alkaloids is likely to be responsible for the alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. All alkaloids were obtained in very small amounts (1-3 mg), only flindersine (**1**) was present in substantial amounts (10 mg).\n\nIn a previous paper concerning the chemical systematics of Cusparieae, which _Neoraputia_ has been assigned,8 the importance of coumarins and anthranilate alkaloids was highlighted. This study brings into focus polyoxygenated flavonoids as another taxonomically useful chemical marker in this group. Many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds presents in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far.\n\nA number of flavonoids isolated from _Neoraputia paraensis_, _N. magnifica_,45_Murraya paniculata_,19_Cirus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon20_ (Rutaceae), _Lonchocarpus montanus21 (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from _Trypanosoma cruzi_. The positive results are summarized at Table 3 and the occurrence of flavonoids evaluated at Table 4. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 65% when 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethyl-5',6'-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (**11**) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 _m_g mL-1, suggesting that chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The flavones 3',4',5',5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (**12**), 3',4',5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone (**13**), 4',5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (**14**) and flavonoid 3',4',5',3,5,6,7-heptamethoxyflavonol (**15**) completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 99-100%) at 100 _m_g mL-1. The activity does not appear to be affected by the introduction of the 3-OMe substituent into the flavone\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound & Concentration (_μ_g mL−1) & Absorbance & Specific activity (U mg−1) & \\% Inhibitory activity \\\\\n**4** & 35 & 0.249 & 14.69 & 68 \\\\ Control & 35 & 0.773 & 45.61 & \\\\\n**5** & 50 & 0.312 & 22.38 & 45 \\\\ Control & 50 & 0.568 & 40.62 & \\\\\n**7** & 50 & 0.606 & 43.28 & 0 \\\\  & 100 & 0.395 & 28.18 & 36 \\\\ Control & 50 & 0.594 & 42.42 & \\\\  & 100 &\n\n## Page 5\n\nskeleton. However, the activity of 3',4',5',3,5,7,8-heptamethoxyflavonol (**16**) was comparable to that of **15** but, reducing the enzymatic activity by 88% at 100 _m_g mL-1. This finding shows that the activity varies with the position of methoxyl group. The higher activity of **12**, **13**, **14** and **15** could possibly be attributed to a greater symmetry of electron density of the molecules. Flavones 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone (**10**) and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (**7**) do not display significant GAPDH activity (26% and 36%, respectively) showing that 3',4'-methylenedioxy reduce drastically inhibitory activity. Differences between polyoxygenated flavones and isoflavone afromosine (**17**) inhibitory activities are not significant, indicating that the presence of many methoxy groups in isoflavones are not a requirement for activity. However, isoflavone possess 3-phenylchromone skeleton and it may be incorrect to compare it with the other flavones tested. GAPDH activity was also inhibited by 96% when auroralordirobtusone A (**18**) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 _m_g mL-1.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Compound & Family/Species & References \\\\\n**4** & Rutaceae \\\\\n**4** & _Neoraputia alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. parensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**5** & _N. alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**7** & _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 4 \\\\\n**10** & _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\\n**11** & _N. magnifica_ & 4, 5 \\\\\n**12** & _N. alba_ & 3 \\\\ _N. magnifica_ & 5 \\\\ _N. paraensis_ & 6, 7 \\\\\n**13** & _Citrus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ & 20 \\\\\n**14** & _C. sinensis_ grafted on _C. limon_ & 20 \\\\\n**15** & _Murraya paniculata_ & 19 \\\\\n**16** & _M. paniculata_ & 19 \\\\  & Leguminosae \\\\\n**17** & _Lonchocarpus montanus_ & 21 \\\\\n**18** & _L. montanus_ & 21 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Occurrence of flavonoids evaluated on TcGAPDH activity \n\n## Page 6\n\nThus, clearly isoflavonoids and auronoids deserve more attention as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitors. Highly oxygenated flavones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal GAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavonoids and the enzyme GAPDH.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General\n\nNMR on a Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard. HSQC, Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence; ESI-MS/MS, low resolution on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument, equipped with a \"Z-spray\" ion source; R-HPLC, Recycling High-Performance Liquid Chromatography on a model Shimadzu LC-6AD; detection (Shimadzu SPD-6AV), UV.\n\n### Plant material\n\n#### Neoraputia paraensis\n\nwas collected in Uruuca, Bahia, Brazil, and a voucher (SPF 81-316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias, USP, Sao Paulo.\n\n#### Isolation of compounds\n\nGround stems (2700 g) and leaves (409 g) of _Neoraputia paraensis_ were extracted with _n_-hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. Only the concentrated extracts containing alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragondorff's reagent on thin-layer chromatography plates, were worked. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations.\n\nThe concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from stem was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel. Elution with a _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1:0.2) afforded 16 fractions. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording **1** (10 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The concentrated CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography over silanized silica elution with MeOH-H2O (1:1) afforded 10 fractions. Fraction 8 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient affording 2 fractions. Fraction 1 was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (5:0.4:0.4) and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (4.6:0.4) affording skimmianine (3 mg). Fraction 2 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 A pore diameter; eluant: CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1); flow rate: 4.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, 254 nm) to give **2** (second peak, 1.2 mg) and dictamnine (first peak, 1.0 mg), after four cycles of 80 min.\n\nThe concentrated _n_-hexane extract of the leaves was four times flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient, _n_-hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, _n_-hexane-EtOAc gradient, and finally with silica gel and Florisil (1:1) eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording **4** (20 mg).\n\nThe concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shocke Asahipack GS-310P; eluant: MeOH; flow rate: 5.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, \\(l\\) 240 nm) to give **8** (second peak, 2.7 mg), after three cycles of 60 min. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 also were purified by R-HPLC (as above; flow rate: 6.0 mL min-1) to give **5** (second peak, 5.0 mg), **6** (second peak, 4.0 mg) and **7** (second peak, 3.0 mg) after three cycles of 60 min, respectively.\n\nHydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyeflavone (**8**).

The reaction medium was 50 mmol L-1 Tris-HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 _b_-mercaptoethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD*, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 4-9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 _m_L. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme.\n\nThe specific activity (unit = U) of the enzyme was calculated as:\n\n\\[(\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}) = \\{(\\Delta\\text{ absorbance}/\\Delta\\text{ t})\\text{ x volume of cell}\\}/6.22\\text{ x volume of enzyme x [ enzyme] where \\(\\Delta\\text{ t}\\) = 0.5 min; volume of cell = 1.00 mL; 'NADH = 6.22 (mmol L-1)-1 cm-1; volume of enzyme = 0.005 mL; [enzyme] concentration of enzyme in mg mL-1.\n\n### _T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity_\n\nThe inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 _m_L. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30s interval. Flavonoids were tested at 50 and 100 _m_g mL-1 in 10% DMSO using 5 _m_L of GAPDH at 0.90 mg mL-1.\n\nIn each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO in the reaction medium and was used as the positive control. The specific activity of TcGAPDH was not significantly affected by the presence of 10% DMSO.\n\nData were means of 3 repetitions and values as percent of control were used as follows:\n\n\\[\\%\\text{ inhibitory activity} = \\{(\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ control} - \\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ compound})/\\text{U mg}^{ - 1}\\text{ control}\\}\\text{ x 100}\\]\n\nEnzymatic inhibition studies have been carried out in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.\n\nSome of the potentially active substances, as flavones **6** and **8**, can not be assayed with the standard procedure described here, due to problems of solubility in the reaction buffer and absorption of light close to the wavelength used to observe the reaction course (340 nm). To overcome these limitations an alternative technique is being developed, based on calorimetric measurements, similar to procedures adopted with other enzymes.24\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES).

St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) permitu to isolamento de duas substancias ineditas: 4-metoxi-6-[2-(metilamino)fenil]-2_H_-piran-2-ona e acetate de _rel-(7R,8R)_-8-[(_E_)-3-hidroxi-3-metil-1-butenil]-4,8-dimetoxi-5,6,7,8-tetraidrofuro[2,3-b]quinolin-7-ila; e dos alcaloides arborinina, \\(N\\)-metil-1-hloroxi-3-metoxiacridona, esquinimana, occusagina, isodutaprina, isocesquinimana iscocoastigma. Arves da analise dos dados espectroscopicos foram establecidas as estruturas quimicas das substancias isoladas sendo que para os alcaloides ineditos tais dados sao descritos pela primeira vez. Alem disso, os ensaios bilogicos sobre as formas triopmastigotas do _Trypanosoma cruzi_ das substancias isoladas mostraram que elas possuem atividade tripanocida moderada.\n\nThe investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract from leaves of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) afforded two new compounds 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2_H_-pyran-2-one and _rel-(7R,8R)_-8-[(_E_)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofluoro[2,3-b]quinoline-7-yl acetate, along with the known compounds arborinine, \\(N\\)-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone, skimimanine, kokusagine, isodutaprine, isoskinaminine, and isokousagine. Their structures were established based on their spectral data, and for the new compounds these data are described herein. Additionally, these compounds were assayed on the triopmastigote forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ showing moderate trypanocidal activity.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe genus _Almeidea_ belongs to Rutaceae family and is widely distributed in Brazil. Data about the secondary metabolites of this genus are available. From _Almeidea guyanensis_ was isolated \\(C\\)-arabinosyl flavones, 2- and 4-quinolones, and flavone \\(C\\)-glycosides.[1] We have previously reported the isolation of triterpenoids, acridone, 2-quinolone, and fluoroquinoline alkaloids, and a new tetrahydrouquinoline alkaloid from _A. coerulea_ and _A. rubra_[2] besides steroids, one sesquiterpene, one cromone, and one flavone.[3]\n\nChagas' disease (American Trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, affecting more than 18 million people in Latin America.[4] Its treatment is still a challenge and new less toxic and more effective drugs are necessary.\n\nAs a part of our search for new trypanocidal compounds and our studies on the chemistry of Rutaceae, a new specimen of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. was investigated. Thus, here we report the isolation, identification and characterization of two new substances (**1** and **2a**) and seven known compounds (**3-9**) from methanol extract of leaves of this plant, in addition to their trypanocidal activities.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of\n\n## Page 2\n\nmethanol extract from leaves of _A. rubra_ afforded two new compounds (**1** and **2a**) and known compounds (Figure 1) arborinine (**3**), _N_-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone (**4**),5 skimmianine (**5**),6 kokusagine (**6**),7 isodotudaprine (**7**),8 isoskimminanine (**8**), and isokkusagine (**9**), which were identified through comparison of their NMR spectral data with the literature.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a yellow powder and its structure was determined by analysis of NMR and LRMS.\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of **1** showed aromatic protons at \\(d\\) 7.33 (2H, m), and 6.70 (2H, m), assigned to H-4', H-6', and H-3', H5', respectively. Two olefinic protons (H-3 and H-5) appeared at \\(d\\) 5.49, and 6.23 (d, \\(J\\) 2.2 Hz) assigned to an 2-pyrone by comparison with a styryl-2-pyrone described by Pizzolatti _et al._,9 besides broad _N_-H and _N_-CH3 signals at \\(d\\) 5.36, and 2.87. Furthermore, a singlet at \\(d\\) 3.85 (3H) revealed the presence of the methoxyl group in the molecule.\n\nThe 13C NMR spectrum of **1** showed 13 carbons, distinguished as 5 quaternaries (_d_ 171.7, 164.0, 162.8, 147.6, 116.0), 4 aromatics (_d_ 132.3, 129.2, 116.4, 111.2), 2 ofelines (_d_ 100.1, 87.3), 1 methoxyl (_d_ 55.9), and 1 _N_-methyl carbon (_d_ 30.4). The analysis of 13C NMR and HSQC spectrum allowed us to attribute undoubtedly all chemical shifts to methyl, vinyl, and aromatic carbons/hydrogens of **1** (Table 1).\n\nThe assignments of quaternary carbons were possible from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-2' was deduced from 3\\(J\\) correlation between _N_-CH3 hydrogens (_d_ 2.87) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 147.6. C-4 (_d_ 171.7) was assigned through 3\\(J\\) correlation between the lowerfield carbon and methoxyl hydrogens (_d_ 3.85). Furthermore, C-6 (_d_ 162.8) and C-1' (_d_ 116.0) were determined through 2_J_-_J_ correlation to H-5 (_d_ 6.23). Finally, through the 2\\(J\\) correlation between H-3 (_d_ 5.49) and a carbonyl carbon at \\(d\\) 164.0 was attributed C-2.\n\nAll these results allowed us to propose the structure 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2_H_-pyran-2-one for compound **1**, which is described for the first time in the literature and represents a new class of compounds formed by the reaction of anthranilic acid and two acetyl/malonyl-CoA units.\n\nSingle crystal X-ray diffraction established undoubtedly the structure of **1** as a derivative of anthranilic acid (Figure 2).\n\nThe crystal structure of compound **1** shows the presence of two independent molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure 2). The main conformational difference between both independent molecules is centered in the dihedral angle between the least square planes that pass through the aromatic rings in each molecule. The value of this angle in molecule 1 is 33.58(8)deg and in molecule 2 is 34.79(8)deg. The crystal structure also shows the presence of one intramolecular interaction in each molecule. These interactions are slightly different due to the conformation\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & HSQC & & HMBC \\\\ Carbon & _δ_c & _δ_H (_J_Ca) & _χ_Ca & _χ_Ca \\\\\n2 & 164.0 & & & \\\\\n3 & 87.3 & 5.49 d (_J_ 2.2 Hz) & 171.7, 164.0 & 100.1 \\\\\n4 & 171.7 & & & \\\\\n5 & 100.1 & 6.23 d (_J_ 2.2 Hz) & 171.7, 162.8 & 116.0, 87.3 \\\\\n6 & 162.8 & & & \\\\\n1’ & 116.0 & & & \\\\\n2’ & 147.6 & & & \\\\\n3’ and 5’ & 116.4, 111.2 & 6.70 m & 147.6, 132.3, 129.2 & 116.0 \\\\\n4’ and 6’ & 132.3, 129.2 & 7.33 m & & 162.8, 147.6 \\\\\n4-OCHi & 55.9 & 3.85 s & & 171.7 \\\\\n2’-/NCH3 & 30.4 & 2.87 s & & 147.6 \\\\\n2’-/NH & - & 5.36 br s & & \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: NMR spectral data (CDCl_γ_, 9.8 T) of substance **1** isolated from _Almeida rubra_\n\nFigure 1: Compounds isolated from _Almeida rubra_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nchanges. The analyses of the crystal packing show the presence of four intermolecular interactions of the type C-H...O that give rise to the formation of chains along the (101) direction. These chains are connected with the chain just above and below it through three intermolecular interactions of the N-H...O type.\n\nThe quinoline and acridine alkaloids, which are widely distributed in Rutaceae, arise from combination of anthranilic acid and acetate/malonate.10 In these cases, the ciclization takes place by nucleophilic attack of nitrogen atom to the carboxyl carbon. However, compound **1** should be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom to the carboxyl carbon, giving rise an _a_-pyrone.\n\nWe have previously reported the isolation of the new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid **2b** (Figure 1) from _A. coerulea.2_ Reinvestigation of _A. rubra_ afforded an alkaloid **2a** whose spectral data seem to be very similar to those of **2b**. This alkaloid was isolated as a white powder and identified by NMR and LRMS. The molecular formula C20H25NO6 of **2a** was defined by elemental analysis.\n\nIn the 1H NMR spectrum of **2a** were observed a pair of doublets (_J_ 2.6 Hz) at \\(d\\) 7.58 and 6.97, and a singlet at \\(d\\) 4.30, which indicate that **2a** was a tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid. The signals at \\(d\\) 2.78, 2.20, and 2.01, assigned to H-5, and H-6, respectively, confirmed that **2a** had a reduced fluoroquinoline ring.\n\n1H NMR spectrum of **2a** also showed two singlets at \\(d\\) 3.14, and 2.03, and a group of signals at \\(d\\) 6.06 (d, \\(J\\) 16.1 Hz), 5.69 (d, \\(J\\) 16.1 Hz), 1.34 (s), and 1.31 (s), which indicated the presence of the 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent. Through the spectral data comparison, it was established that **2a** distinguished from **2b** by the presence of 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent instead of \\(g\\),_g_-dimethylallyl moiety.\n\nAnalysis of HSQC correlations and literature data2 allowed us to attribute undoubtedly chemical shifts to methyl, methylene, vinyl, furanyl hydrogen/carbon of **2a** (Table 2).\n\nThe assignments of quaternary carbons of **2a** were made from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-4 was deduced from 3\\(J\\) correlation between methoxyl hydrogens at C-4 (_d_ 4.30) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 158.2. The correlation of the other methoxyl hydrogens (_d_ 3.14) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 79.7 determined\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Carbon & \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) & HSQC & HMBC \\\\\n4 & 162.7 & & & \\\\\n3 & 105.2 & & & \\\\\n4 & 158.2 & & & \\\\\n4a & 117.6 & & & \\\\\n5 & 19.5 & 2.78 m & 117.6, 23.5 & 158.2, 150.0, 72.6 \\\\\n6 & 23.5 & 2.20, 2.01 m & 72.6, 19.5 & 117.6, 79.7 \\\\\n7 & 72.6 & 5.43 dd (_J_ 8.5, 2\n\n## Page 4\n\nC-8. C-4a was assigned through correlation between the carbon at d 117.6 and H-5, and H-6 (d 2.78, and 2.01). H-5 also correlated to C-8a (d 150.0). Furthermore, methyl hydrogens at d 1.34, and 1.31, correlated with an oxygenated carbon at d 70.8, establishing C-3\". Finally, the correlation between furanyl hydrogens (d 7.58, and 6.97) and quaternary carbons at d 162.7, and 105.2 determined C-2, and C-3, respectively.\n\nThe close similarity between the chemical shifts observed for carbons of reduced fluoroquinoline ring when compared with the model compound 7-_O_-acetylha-plophyllidine (**2b**)2 led us to suggest a _trans_ relationship between the 7-acetoxy and 8-methoxy groups. Alkaloid **2a**, _rel_-(7\\(R\\),8_R_)-8-[(_E_)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro [2,3-_b_]quinoline-7-yl acetate, is described for the first time in the literature, and the occurrence of tetrahydrouroquinoline alkaloid such as **2a** and **2b** seems to be restricted to the genera _Almeidea_ and _Haplophyllum_ of Rutaceae family.2,11\n\nIn order to improve the therapy of Chagas disease, we have been studying species of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, Burseraceae, and Cheoraceae) aiming to isolate hit compounds that could be used in the development of new antichagasic drugs.\n\nCompounds described in this paper were isolated from an active fraction of _A. rubra_ (62.9% lysis - percent reduction of the parasite number) on the tripomastigote forms of _T. cruzi_.12 Their _in vitro_ trypanocidal actions are shown on Table 3. Three of them (**7**-**9**) could not be assayed due to their instability.\n\nThe results showed that all of compounds had moderate trypanocidal actions and kokusagine (**6**) was the most active one. Probably, they are responsible by the activity of the _A. rubra_ fraction.12 However, they could not be considered good prototype for the development of new antichagasic drugs, mainly when their activities are compared with crystal violet and some lignans also isolated from other Rutaceae.13\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nThe 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using either Bruker DRX-200 and ARX-400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard.\n\nLow resolution EIMS were recorded on GC-17A, GCMS-QP5000 Shimadzu.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe leaves of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. were collected in May 2000 in Espirito Santo State, southeast of Brazil. The plant material was identified by Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani _et al_. 4746) was deposited at the Herbarium of that Department.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nDried leaves (313.5 g) were extracted first with hexane and then with MeOH at room temp. Part of the methanol extract (15.9 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield the corresponding fractions (ALFMH, ALFMD, ALFMA, ALFMM). The fraction ALFMA (3.3208 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 410 x 43 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give eleven fractions.\n\nThe second fraction (ALFMA2; 0.6302 g) was chromatographed on silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 358 x 31 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:AcOEt 8:2-MeOH) to afford ten fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) from the fraction five (ALFMA2,5; 103.6 mg) was obtained four fractions. Then, the second fraction (ALFMA2,5,2; 68.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient) to give four fractions. The third fraction (ALFMA2,5,2,3; 36.0 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (1:1) to afford six fractions. Through column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient) of the fraction five (ALFMA2,5,2,3,5; 14.3 mg) was isolated the alkaloid **2a** (2.6 mg).\n\nFraction four (ALFMA4; 178.1 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound & Concentration (μg/mL) & x Lysis \\% & IC50 \\\\\n500 & 250 & 100 & (mmol/L) \\\\\n**1** & 74.10 & 45.08 & 27.23 & 1.271 \\\\\n**2a** & 58.93 & 44.20 & 28.12 & 0.977 \\\\\n**3** & 57.99 & 42.39 & 24.00 & 1.231 \\\\\n**4** & 45.60 & 43.20 & 31.20 & 2.600 \\\\\n**5** & 65.17 & 30.35 & 25.44 & 1.455 \\\\\n**6** & 58.38 & 57.13 & 46.58 & 0.5596 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Trypanocidal activity of compounds isolated from _Almeidea rubra_\n\n## Page 5\n\nand eluted with MeOH to afford five fractions.

Then, the fourth fraction (ALFMA4,3,4; 2.3 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (332 x 25 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) to give three fractions. Further purification of the fraction two (ALFMA4,3,4,2; 2.0 mg) on preparative planar silica plate with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) afforded alkaloid **6** (1.6 mg). Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH) of the fraction five (ALFMA4,3,5; 21.5 mg) was isolated the compound **1** (14.7 mg).\n\nThe alkaloids arborinine (**3**) (43.2 mg), isodotudaprine (**7**) (25.6 mg), and isoskimminanine (**8**) (28.8 mg) were crystallized in MeOH from fraction six (ALFMA6; 104.5 mg), seven (ALFMA7; 317.3 mg) and nine (ALFMA9; 120.5 mg), respectively.\n\nThe other alkaloid isokokusagine (**9**) (32.1 mg) was purified on sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH) from fraction eight (ALFMA8; 90.3 mg), and the alkaloid **4** (3.2 mg) was obtained from fraction three (148.8 mg).\n\n#### 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one (1)\n\nYellow powder; elemental analysis (Found: C, 68.0432; H, 5.565904; N, 6.11885.

Data were collected up to 50deg in 2_th_, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;14 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.15 No absorption corrections were applied.\n\nThe structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.16 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.17 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. The programs SHELXL-97,17 and ORTEP-318 were used within WinGX19 to prepare materials for publication. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles, and thermal parameters have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.\n\nThe supplementary crystallographic data have been sent in electronic format to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, as CIF file No. CCDC 242119.

The infected blood was diluted with healthy mice blood to achieve a concentration of 2.106 forms/mL. Solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The activities of substances were evaluated at 500, 250, and 100 _m_g/mL.\n\nThe bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) which contained 400 _m_L mixture/well. The plates were incubated at 4 degC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h, following the method described by Brener.20\n\nInfected blood with the same volume of DMSO was used as control, and gentian violet to a concentration of 250 _m_g/mL was used as positive control.\n\nThe activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 values were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to FAPESP and CNPq for the \n\n## Page 6\n\nfinancial support and to Dr Jose Rubens Pirani for collecting and identifying the _Almeidea rubra_ specimen.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Jay, M.; Gleye, J.; Bouillant, M.L.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Phytochemistry_**1979**, _18_, 184 ; Moulis, C.; Wirasutisna, K.R.; Gleye, J.; Loiseau, P.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Pytochemistry_**1983**, _22_, 2095; Wirasutisna, K.R.; Gleye, J.; Moulis, C.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Pytochemistry_**1986**, _25_, 558.\n* [2] Santos, C.S.; Januario, A.H.; Vieira, P.C.; Fernandes, J.B.; Da Silva, M.F.G.F.; Pirani, J.R.; _J.

Additionally, three inactive neoligans, including the new bicycle[3.2.1]octane neoligan 2\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-oxo-piperol B were obtained and characterized by spectrometric methods.\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Nectandra grandiflora_ Nees is a tree belonging to Lauraceae family, which is known for economically important species such as _Aniba roseodora_ (\"pau-rosa\"), the main source of sesquiterpene (linalool)-rich essential oil used in perfumery; and species with scented leaves and bark such as _Laurus nobilis_ (bay leaves) and _Ocotea odorifera_ (Brazilian cinnamon), widely used as conditions.[1, 2] Lignans and neoligans are important classes of secondary metabolites occurring in Lauraceae species, which include several medicinally important closely related compounds as the anti-mitotic podophyllotoxin, extracted from _Podophyllutum peltatum_ (Berberidaceae), used in the preparation of the antitumoral lignans etoposide and teniposide, and the antioxidant _nordihydroguaiaretic acid_ (NDGA), obtained from _Larrea tridentata_ (Zygophyllaceae).[4]\n\n_Nectandra_ species are extensively used in folk medicine due to their antirheumatic, digestive and diuretic properties.[5] Some of the claimed medicinal properties have been substantiated by studies, e.g. on _Nectandra salicifolia_, which showed antifungal and vascular muscle relaxing properties,[6] in addition to antimalarial activity due to the presence of the alkaloid costaricin in its bark extract.[7] Previous work on _N. grandiflora_ evidenced the presence of aporphine alkaloids and antitumoral activity in its bark extract.[8]\n\nA number of pathologies are known to be ultimately associated with the imbalance of pro and antioxidant factors in living systems. Exogenous antioxidant compounds may therefore exert beneficial actions upon \n\n## Page 2\n\nsystems which have been deprived from sufficient amounts of endogenous antioxidants as in some cardiovascular diseases, tumors, inflammation, ulcer and aging.9\n\nAs part of our ongoing projects aiming the phytochemical investigation of Sao Paulo State flora,10-12 the EtOH crude extract from leaves of _N. grandiflora_ collected at Jureia State Park, Atlantic Forest, have been subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation using the b-carotene test on TLC for the detection of antioxidant compounds.13 Pure compounds isolated from this extract were further evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity towards the stable free radical DPPH and compared to standard compounds rutin and BHT.11,14 Non-active fractions were also investigated and afforded the benzofuran neolignan burchellin and two bicyclocotane[3.2.1] neoligans: piperol B and the new 2'-oxo-piperol B.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe EtOH crude extract of _N. grandiflora_ leaves was successively partitioned with organic solvents affording hexane, CHCl3, EtOHAc and MeOH extracts. The TLC test using b-carotene as revealing agent indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the EtOHAc and MeOH fractions. Chromatographic fractionation of these extracts led to the isolation of protocatechuic acid (**6**) and flavonoid glycosides afzelin (**4**) and quercetrin (**5**), which were identified through analyses of their MS and NMR spectra and comparison with literature data.15,16 Fractionation of the CHCl3 extract led to the isolation of neoligans **1-3.**\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as a light brown viscous oil and its 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals for sp2 carbons and 9 signals for sp3 carbons, including three signals at _ca._ d 56, assigned to three methoxy groups on sp2 carbons (Table 1). These data combined with HRMS analysis in the positive ion mode [(C2H2O3, (M+1)+ 357; expanded to C18H18O2O2(OCH3)3] suggested compound **1** is a bicarbonyl neolignan, with 13C NMR signals for C=O groups at d 190.5 and d 203.0.\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of compound **1** showed three broad doublets at d 2.48, d 5.08 and d 5.14, and one multiplet at d 5.89 assigned to hydrogens of an allyl moiety. Additionally, a doublet at d 0.09 (3 H-9) and a quintuplet at d 2.08 (H-8) indicated compound **1** is a guianin type bicyclocotane neolignan.17,18 The absence of a doublet at _ca._ d 5.90 for an oxybenzylic hydrogen of the related benzofuran type neoligans, gave additional support to this proposal. Its relative stereochemistry was deduced from the absence of anisotropy from the aromatic ring on the deshielded H-9 (d 0.99) evidencing a _trans_ relationship between methyl group C-9 and the aromatic ring.17,18\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} position & \\(\\delta_{\\text{n}}\\)b & \\(\\delta_{\\text{c}}\\)c & HMDC \\\\\n1 & - & 134.3 s & - \\\\\n2 & 6.47 d (2) & 110.6 d & C-7 \\\\\n3 & - & 148.6 s & - \\\\\n4 & - & 149.6 s & - \\\\\n5 & 6.71 d (8) & 111.8 d & - \\\\\n6 & 6.55 dd (2 e 8) & 119.5 d & - \\\\\n7 & 2.4\n\n## Page 3\n\nMoreover, the bicycle bridge associated with the guianin type configuration of **1** is evidenced by the absorption of H-6' at d 5.72. Further analysis of NMR spectra and comparison with literature data for other guianin-type compounds suggested the presence of an \\(a\\), _b_-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and an additional carbonyl (C-2', \\(v\\) 1760 cm-1) in the bicyclic moiety.17,18 HMQC correlations allowed the complete assignment of hydrogen signals to carbons; and HMBC correlations of C-2' to H-7, H-3' and H-7'; and C-4' to H-7 and H-3' supported the position of carbonyl groups at C-2' and C-4' in the bicyclic moiety, respectively (Figure 1). This spectrum also showed correlations of C-5' to H-3'; C-7' to H-6'; and C-1 to H-7, H-8 and H-3', which supported the position of one methoxyl at C-5', the allyl group at C-1' and aromatic ring at C-7. Additional cross-peaks in the HMBC spectrum gave support to the proposed structure for compound **1** (Figure 1).\n\nESI(+)-MS/MS experiments for the protonated molecule of _m_/_z_ 357 with dissociation induced by collisions with argon provides further structural characterization as dissociation forms major ionic fragments of _m_/_z_ 316 (24), 341 (8), and 301 (22) owing to the losses of an allyl, methyl and allyl plus methyl radicals, in addition to a fragment ion of _m_/_z_ 151 (9), assigned to the dimethoxytropilium ion. Additionally, the protonated **1**, of _m_/_z_ 357, dissociates by the loss of a neutral molecule of 1,2-dimethoxybenzene to yield the ion of _m_/_z_ 219 (Figure 2), which likely rearranges to form an acylium ion that subsequently loses a neutral C3H4 alleine to yield an ion of _m_/_z_ 179. Additional data from a LRMS experiment showed the base peak of _m_/_z_ 179 and peaks at 357, 325, 316 and 219 (see Experimental section), which gave support to the structure proposed for compound **1**. These data are fully consistent with the new bicyclooctane neolignan **1**, which is therefore assigned as (75*, 8_R_*, 1'_R_*, 3'_R_*)-3,4,5'-trimethoxy-3,7'-cyclo-8,1'-neolig-8'-ene-2,4'(3'H)-dione.\n\nCompound **2** was identified as the bicycle [3.2.1]octane neolignan piperol B and compound **3**, as the benzofuran neolignan burchellin, previously isolated from _Piper betle_ and _Aniba burchelli_, respectively.19,20 Compound **2** is a guianin type and compound **3** is a porosin type neolignan and their identification was based on extensive analyses of NMR data as well as on comparison with literature data for guianin, porosin and ferrearin type neoligans, which are widely distributed in Lauraceae species.21\n\nThe antiradicar activity of compounds **1**-**6** has been evaluated towards the stable free radical DPPH, which exhibits an absorption maximum at 517 nm, evidencing prominent activities of compounds **4**-**6** (Figure 3) and poor activities for compounds **1**-**3.** The absence of phenolic hydroxyls in the latter renders them less effective in promoting DPPH reduction, therefore appearing as poor radical scavengers. The free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids and other phenols is mostly due to their aromatic hydroxy groups, which confer great stability to the phenolic radical as soon it is formed, after one hydrogen radical donation to DPPH. The stronger activity of compound **5** when compared to compounds **4** and **6** is probably due to the catechol moiety in the B ring of quercetin along with its extended conjugation through the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl system on the C ring, which are some of the major structural features associated with antioxidant activity of flavonoids.22 The comparison with standard compound rutin (DA=81% at 50 \\(m\\) mol L-1) evidences the reported major roles of some structural\n\nFigure 1: Selected HMBC correlations for compound **1**.\n\nFigure 3: Free-radical scavenging activity of compounds **4**-**6** and reference compounds BHT and rutin.\n\nFigure 2: Dissociation routes to selected ESI(+)-MS/MS ionic fragments for compound **1**.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nfeatures of flavonoids as the catechol moiety present in the B ring and the C2-C3 double bond for the enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity.22 On the other hand, the synthetic antioxidant BHT (DA=9% at 50 _m_mol L-1) exhibited the weakest antiradicalar activity as expected, due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH.23\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 Mesh) and Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used for all column chromatography separations unless otherwise stated. HPLC separations were performed on a Waters Prep LC 4000 System and C-18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns (4.6 mm and 20mm i.d. for analytical and preparative columns, respectively) and pre-columns were used. All solvents (Merck or Malinckrodt) were of analytical or HPLC grade. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. Low resolution ESI(+)-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. High resolution ESI(+)-MS analysis were performed on a hybrid double quadrupole (Qq) and orthogonal time-of-flight (Tof) mass spectrometer (Qtof, Micromass UK) operating at 7.000 resolution and mass accuracy of 10 ppm. The temperature of the nebulizer was 50 degC. The ESI and mass spectrometer were operated in the positive ion mode. The cone and extractor potential were set to 40 and 0 V, respectively. The _m_/z scan range was from 50 up to 1000. Tandem mass spectrometric [ESI(+)-MS/MS] experiments were performed using the product ion scan mode via Q1 mass selection of the desirable product ion, q2 collision-induced dissociation (CID) with N2, and orthogonal TOF mass analysis of the CID ionic fragments. The collision energy ranged from 15 to 25 eV, depending on the dissociation ability of the precursor ion.\n\n### Plant material\n\n#### Nectandra grandiflora\n\nleaves were collected in Jureia-Itatins State Park, Atlantic Forest, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Ines Cordeiro. The voucher specimens (number: Moraes 05) were deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Botanica-SEMA, SP, Brazil.\n\n#### Extraction and isolation\n\nDried and ground leaves (2.0 kg) were extracted with ethanol at r.t. and afforded a dark green EtOH extract (5.0 g) after solvent evaporation under vacuum. Partition of the EtOH extract with organic solvents gave the hexane (0.6g), CHCl3 (1.6 g), EtOHAc (0.5 g) and hydroalcoholic (2.3 g) extracts after solvent evaporation. MPLC on silica gel of the CHCl3 extract (1.6 g, hexane/EtOAc gradient) gave 15 pooled fractions (A1-A15). Fraction A2 (41.0 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl/acetone/HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound **2** (12.2 mg). Fraction A3 (32.1 mg), obtained from the elution with hexane/EtOAc 4:1, was further purified by preparative TLC (CHCl/acetone/HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound **1** (6.8 mg). Fraction A6 (88.1 mg) was recrystallized in MeOH to afford compound **3** (25.5 mg). CC on Sephadex LH-20 of the EtOAc fraction (200.0 mg) eluted with MeOH resulted in 42 subfractions which were pooled after TLC analysis (B1-B4). Fr. B2 (38.7 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/HOAc 79:18:2:1) and gave compound **4** (7.1 mg). Purification of fraction B3 (45.1 mg) by preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 36:12:1:1) afforded compound **5** (14.0 mg). The hydroalcoholic fraction (200.0 mg) was submitted to CC on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH resulting in 10 fractions (C1-C10). Purification of fraction C-8 (37.7 mg) by RP-HPLC (C18 Luna-Phenomenex column, MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 55:43:2, 8 mL min-1, detection at 280 nm) gave compound **6** (8.1 mg).\n\n#### Bleaching of b-carotene on TLC plates\n\nSamples were eluted on TLC plates which were then dried and sprayed with 0.02% solution of b-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates are placed under natural light until discoloration of background. The remaining yellow spots indicate the presence of antioxidants.13\n\n\\[Reduction\\ of\\ 2,2\\text{-diphenyl-}1\\text{-picrylhydrazyl}\\ radical\\ (DPPH)\\]\n\nThe free radical scavenging capacities of the isolates and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated from their ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 _m_mol L-1 to 100 _m_mol L-1were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated as DA= (Ao-A)/Ao.11,14\n\n_(7S*,8R*,1'R*,3'R*)-3,4,5'-trimethoxy-3,7'-cyclo-8,1'-neolig-8'-ene-2,4'(3'H)-dione (**1**).

The mutualism between the fungus and the ants is a point to be explored when alternative methods of control are being thought of. Considering that some plants are naturally resistant to phytophagous insects, some natural products (secondary metabolites) should be evaluated with respect to their insecticide and/or fungicide properties. In this paper we isolated eight coumarins from four different plant species and we determined their effect on the development of the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ant _Atta sexdens_. With the exception of clausarin, all the other coumarins were inhibitory from 64 \\(\\mu\\)g mL-\\({}^{1}\\) through 80 \\(\\mu\\)g mL-\\({}^{1}\\) and xanthyletin inhibited the fungus at 25 \\(\\mu\\)g mL-\\({}^{1}\\)\n\n## Introduction\n\nLeaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores in the tropics, can be found from the Southern United States to Northern Argentina.[1] They cultivate a symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, thus damaging agriculture.[2]\n\nIt is known that plants have several mechanisms to avoid herbivores, including a set of toxic chemicals.[3] The presence of secondary plant metabolites toxic to the ants and/or to their symbiotic fungi may play an important role in whether the ants will cut such plants or not.[4]\n\nMany of the most important crops cultivated in our country are exotic species, which have not had the possibility of co-evolution with predators and as such are preferentially attacked.[5]\n\nDifferent methods have been proposed for the control of these ants (organophosphorus, pyrethroids and sulfuramid insecticides). However, problems with non-target animals, high chemical stability and environmental contamination are common and it is necessary to continue looking for new strategies to control these insects.[6] The search for specific compounds directed against these ants and their microbial partners has been the focus of our studies during the past years and natural chemicals isolated from a variety of plant species were effective against the ants and inhibited the growth of their symbiotic fungus or both.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\n\nAmong the several biological properties of coumarins we can find dermal photosensitising, estrogenic, antimicrobial, vasodilator, molluscicidal, antihelmintic,\n\n## Page 2\n\nsedative and hypnotic, analgesic and hypothermic activities,16,17 but they have been associated mainly with anticoagulant activity.18 Indeed, they are widely found in several botanical families such as Rutaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Moraceae and Thymeleaceae and it seems to correlate with their action as phytoalexins. Repellent action to beetles and other terrestrial invertebrates and the inhibition of both sporulation and the growth of some fungal plant pathogens by some coumarins were described by Weinmann.19\n\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the activity of eight coumarins isolated from different plant species on the development of the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ant _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Preparation and fractioning of crude extracts\n\nDifferent parts of plants were ground to powder, dried at 40 degC and percolated with a set of organic solvents (hexane, dichloromethane and methanol) during 72 hours three times each at room temperature for three days, followed by the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure at 40 degC. The crude extracts were fractionated through flash chromatography under vacuum with silica gel and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol). They were then purified through different techniques including column chromatography, preparative TLC and HPLC.\n\n### Coumarins\n\nAngelicin (**1**), suberosin (**2**), xanthoxyletin (**3**) and clausarin (**4**) were isolated from the methanol extract of the roots of _Citrus limonia_. Isopimpinellin (**5**) was isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the roots of _Adiscanthus fusciflorus_ Ducke. Umbelliferone (**6**) was isolated from the hydroalcoholic extract of the banks of _Picramnia taepensis_, xanthyletin (**7**) and 7-hydroxy-3-(1'1'-dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (**8**) were isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the stems of _Pilocarpus riedelianus_.\n\nAll the coumarins were identified through spectrometric techniques such as 'H NMR, 13C NMR, MS and IR and compared to literature data for (**1**); 20 (**2**); 21-23 (**3**); 22,24 (**4**); 22 (**5**); 22,23,25-27 (**6**); 28 (**7**); 28,29 (**8**).30\n\n### Fungus\n\nThe fungus _Leucoagaricus gongylophorus_ (Singer) Moller (syn _Rozites gongylophorus_) was isolated from a laboratory nest of _Atta sexdens_ L.\n\nThe medium for fungus maintenance and methods for the bioassays were previously described.10 One mL of dichloromethane solution of each coumarin was added to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose, 10.0; sodium chloride, 5.0; peptone, 5.0; malt extract, 10.0 and agar, 15.0. Control tubes received 1.0 mL of dichloromethane and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes were autoclaved at 121 degC by 15 min and then slanted. The final concentration of each coumarin in _m_g mL-1 was: **1**=72; **2**=64; **3**= 70; **4**=75; **5**=80; **6**=65; **7**=25 and **8**=75. The fungal suspension was prepared by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1 g L-1) and gently fragmented. One mL of this suspension was spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at 25(+-1) degC for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two sets of five tubes each). Controls with and without solvent as well as with PBO (**9**) (commercial piperonil butoxide - Pirisa Piretro Industrial, 97LO106IO) were run simultaneously. Fungal growth was estimated macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and density using the modal value.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nFigure 1 shows the molecular structure of the isolated coumarins and on Table 1 we can see the effects of the coumarins on the fungal growth. Except for clausarin (**4**), which had no effect on the fungal development at a concentration of 75 _m_g mL-1, all the others inhibited the fungus at different degrees. Thus, at 72 _m_g mL-1, angelicin (**1**) was responsible for a moderate (40%) inhibition of fungal growth whereas an inhibition of 60% was achieved with umbelliferone (**6**) at 65 _m_g mL-1. Strong inhibition (80% at 75 _m_g mL-1) was observed with 7-hydroxy-3-(1',1'-dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (**8**) and total inhibition of fungal growth was observed with suberosin (**2**), xanthoxyletin (**3**) and isopimpinellin (**5**) at concentrations ranging from 64 to 80 _m_g mL-1. Unfortunately, we did not have enough material to determine whether suberosin, xanthoxyletin and isopimpinellin could be inhibitory at a lower concentration. Victor31 had shown total inhibition of the fungus in the presence of xanthyletin (**7**) at concentrations of 100 and 50 _m_g mL-1. The same effect was now observed at 25 _m_g mL-1 showing that this compound should be better evaluated in respect to its potential in the control of these insects.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nFive out of the eight coumarins assayed were isolated from the roots of \\(Citrus\\)\\(limonia\\) and \\(Adiscanthus\\)\\(fusciflorus\\). Natural coumarins are synthesized by plants as a response to injury during the wilting process, diseases or drying and accumulate on the surface of leaves, fruits and seeds. According to Ojala32 their presence in the roots may provide a tool against microbial invasion.\n\nAttempts to correlate structure and antimicrobial activity of coumarins were made by some authors. Kayser and Kolodziej33 reported that highly oxygenated coumarins and the positions of the polar hydroxyls and of the less polar methoxy groups on the aromatic nucleus are important for antibacterial activity. Yet, according to Dini _et al._ (apud Sardari _et al._34) the occurrence of the aromatic hydroxy group and/or ether or ester groups at positions 6 or 7 of the basic structure are important for antifungal action. For them, alkylated derivatives of 7-hydroxycoumarins can have both antifungal and antibacterial properties. On the other hand, Sardari _et al._34 did not find antifungal activity of coumarins with a hydroxy group at position 7, as observed with umbelliferone, which showed low activity against _Candida albicans_, _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and _Aspergillus niger_ but they found a relationship between antifungal activity and the presence of free 6-OH and 6-OMe. The results of Sardari _et al._34 were confirmed by Ojala _et al._35 with _C. albicans_, _A. niger_ and _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ but not for the phytopathogenic fungus _Fusarium culmorum_ to which umbelliferone was highly inhibitory. So, if some structure-activity relationship can be made, the hypothesis about a possible species-specific activity cannot be discarded.\n\nExcept for clausarin (**4**) our results showed that the seven linear coumarins assayed inhibited the symbiotic fungus of _A. sexdens_ at low concentrations whereas a low inhibition was achieved with angelicin. Since angelicin was the only angular coumarin assayed in this work it was not possible to establish at this moment any relationship between antifungal activity and linearity. Also the occurrence of prenyl and MeO groups linked to the basic structure of coumarins should be better studied in order to determine if they are important or not for the antifungal activity described here.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Mariconi, F.

Their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments as quercetin-3-_O_-rutinoside (**2**), kaempferol-3-_O_-rutinoside (**3**), kaempferol-3-_O_-_a_-L-rhamnopyranoside-(1-9-6)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactopyranoside (**4**), quercetin-3-_O_-\\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranoside-[(1-4)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactopyranoside (**5**), 6-hydroxy-rutin (**6**), kaempferol-3-_O_-D-galactopyranoside (**7**), kaempferol-3-_O_-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**8**) and kaempferol-3-_O_-\\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranoside)-[(1-4)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-glucopyranoside (**9**). In addition, catechoin (**10**) and catechin-(4-\\(\\alpha\\)-8)-catechin-procyanidin B-3) (**11**) were isolated. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative properties using an autographic assay based on \\(\\beta\\)-carotene bleaching on TLC plates, and spectrophotometric detection by reduction of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Flavonoids **2**, **5**, **6**, **10** and **11** displayed strong free radical scavenging activity, when compared with the standards BHT and rutin.\n\n**Keywords**: Rubiaceae, chimarrhoside, DPPH, \\(\\beta\\)-carotene\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn recent years, flavonoids have been widely recognized as a major class of secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties due to their ability to scavenge free radicals.[1, 2, 3] Antioxidant is a broad classification for molecules that may act prior to, or during, a free radical chain reaction at initiation, propagation, termination, decomposition, or subsequent reaction of oxidation products as sensitive targets.[4] There are several diseases, whose causes and severity are linked to oxidation, mainly those associated with oxygen free radicals, which have been implicated as mediators of degenerative and chronic deteriorative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases,[5] such as rheumatoid arthritis,[6] diabetes, vascular disease and hypertension, cancer and hyperplastic diseases,[7] cataract formation and aging processes.[8] Radical-mediated pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion, asthma and many others involving an imbalance in pro-oxidant-antioxidant processes.[9] In our search for antioxidant compounds from Amazonian plant species, we examined constituents of \\(Chimarrhis\\)\\(turbinata\\) DC Rodr.. (Rubiaceae) leaves, collected in the city of Belem, Para State, Brazil. The chemical composition of _C. turbinata_ has been studied previously, and bioactive indole alkaloids were identified.[10, 12] In this paper, we describe the isolation \n\n## Page 2\n\nof a new bifluxonoid, named chimarrhoside (**1**), and eight known flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant effects, which were deduced by electrochemical detection coupled to an HPLC system, bleaching of _b_-carotene on TLC plates, and parameters related to the evaluation of antioxidant activity measured by free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nChimarrhoside (**1**) was obtained as an amorphous pale yellow powder from the EtOH extract and exhibited in its mass spectrum a molecular ion peak at _m/z_ 1171 [M+H]+ obtained from ESIMS. The IR and UV spectra of **1** revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (270, 295, 344 nm, 1690 cm-1). Part of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of compound **1** were observed in duplicate, suggesting a dimer (Table 1). Comparison of the 13C NMR values of **1** with literature data13 evidenced the kaempfero1 algvcone and additional similar spectral features to those of **3**, also isolated in this work, except for the duplication of some signals for carbons arising from a dimer structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum of **1**, signals for two kaempfero1 units as two _meta_-coupled A-ring hydrogens (H-6/H-8) and two pairs of coupled B-ring hydrogens (H-3'/H-5' and H-2'/H-6') for each aglycone were observed, in addition to four anomeric hydrogens at \\(d\\) 5.12 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) 7.7 Hz), 5.02 (1H, d, \\(J\\) 7.7 Hz), 4.40 (1H, br s), 4.60 (1H, br s), 20 hydroxymethine and 2 hydroxymethylene hydrogens. The 13C NMR spectrum of **1** revealed the presence of two kaempfero1 moieties and 24 hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene signals which, analyzed together with 1H NMR data (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of two diglycoside moieties identified as rutinosyl and a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside. This assumption was supported by signals at \\(d\\) 103.1 / 67.1 and \\(d\\) 104.0 / 65.9, assigned to C-1\" C-6\" of the glucopyranosyl and of the galactopyranosyl moiety respectively. Those signals also showed HMQC correlations with H-1\" (anomeric) and H-6\" (Table 1); as well as signals at \\(d\\) 100.9/16.4 and \\(d\\) 100.4/16.6, assigned to C-1'''/C-6''' of the two rhamnopyranosyl moieties, respectively, which also showed HMQC correlations with H-1''' (_d_ 4.4 0 and 4.60) and H-6''' (_d_ 1.17 and 1.11). On the basis of the above data, the chemical shifts assigned for each sugar: the glucosyl and galactosyl moieties were confirmed taking into account the values at \\(d\\) 103.1, 76.6, 75.7, 74.3, 70.1 and 67.1 as well as \\(d\\) 104.0, 73.9, 73.6, 71.5, 68.2 and 65.9 attributed to glucose and galactose, respectively.15 According to literature data, using the same solvent, the chemical shifts of hydroxymethines carbons in glucose are quite deshielded when compared to those of galactose. The glucosyl/galactosyl groups are linked to the rhamnosyl residue at C-6\", because the signal assigned to this carbon, in both sugar moieties, was markedly displaced downfield at \\(d\\) 67.1/65.9 (D_d_ + 6), respectively when compared with the 13C NMR spectrum of free hydroxymethylenes in glucose/galactose. This also was confirmed by the observation of a HMBC long-range correlation of the anomeric hydrogen signal of the rhamnosyl group at \\(d\\) 4.40 / 4.60 with C-6\" of the glucosyl moieties at 67.1 and 65.9, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the site of glycosylation at C-3 of each kaempfero1 moiety was evidenced from downfield shifts of C-2 (D_d_ +9) and C-4 (D_d_ +2) and upfield shift of C-3 (D_d_ -3) when compared to the aglycone,15 as well as from HMBC correlations of H-1\" to C-3a/3b within each kaempfero1 diglycoside moiety (Figure 1). Further HMBC correlations of H-6 and H-8 with C-7 (_d_ 164.6) confirmed the assignments for ring A and suggested the interflavonoidic linkage at C-7 due to the observed downfield shift of its signal when compared to the monomer.15 Moreover, ESIMS analysis showed peaks of _m/z_ 298 (70) and 133 (40) resulting from Retro Diels-Alder (RDA) fragmentations. From moiety A wherein bonds 1 and 3 undergo scission, lead to formation of ions I and II as well as scission of bonds 0 and 2 led to the formation of fragment _m/z_ 433 (30). The fragment _m/z_ 298 (70), was generated by both RDA suffered by moiety A and moiety B (Figure 2). Additional fragments observed in the mass spectra are in accordance with those reported for kaempfero1.16 These data, combined with HPLC analysis, which showed a lower retention time for compound **1** (5.7 min) when compared to monomeric flavonoid diglycosides **2** (9.8 min) and **3** (13.8 min.) (Figure 3), confirmed the proposed structure for compound **1** as kaempfero1 _3_-_O_-_b_-rutinosyl-(7\\(a\\) -\n\n## Page 3\n\npyranosyl-(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside (**4**), quercetin-3_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside (**5**), 6-hydroxy-rutin (**6**), kaempferol-3_O_-D_-galactopyranoside (**7**), kaempferol-3_O_-D-glucopyranoside (**8**) and kaempferol-3_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 6)-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 4)-b-D glucopyranoside (**9**), catechin (**10**) and catechin-(4\\(a\\) - 8)-catechin (procyanidin B-3) (**11**). These compounds were identified and their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments and compared with literature data (Figure 4).13-15, 18, 19-22, 26-28\n\nThe radical scavenging effects obtained for compounds **2-11** assayed with DPPH are shown in (Table 2) using as reference the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 21.34 _m_g mL-1) and BHT (IC50 62.50 _m_g mL-1). These results indicate that the free-radical scavenging activity of these\n\nFigure 2.: Selected fragment ions from compound **1** by ESIMS.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nmicromolecules is due to its hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the ease of stabilization of the phenoxyl radical after reduction of DPPH and is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by the IC50 values for compounds **2, 5, 6, 10**, and **11**.24\n\nIt is also evident from Table 2, that _ortho_-dihydroxy moiety plays more important role for this type of activity than the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl, as the lack of the latter, e.g. in compound **10**, contributed in a lesser extent to the loss of activity, as observed for compounds **3**, **4** and **7-9**, due to the missing catechol group. On the other side, the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline  & Moiety I & Moiety II & \\\\ C & \\(\\partial_{\\text{c}}\\) & \\(\\partial_{\\text{fit}}\\left(J\\ \\text{Hz}\\right)\\) & \\(\\partial_{\\text{c}}\\) & \\(\\partial_{\\text{H}}\\left(J\\ \\text{Hz}\\right)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 157.1 s & &\n\n## Page 5\n\npresence of an additional catechol group as in compound **11**, rendered as the most effective in scavenging free radicals, evidenced by its IC50 value, lower that that for rutin used as standard compound.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nCommercial b-carotene (Aldrich) and DPPH (Aldrich) were used in the antioxidant assays. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 degC and referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance (CD3OD at d 3.33 and 49.0 for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR-Nicolet, model EMACT-40 Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer, in the range 500-4000 cm-1. ESIMS spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10-20 eV with argon. Silica gel 60H (230-400 _m_), (60-230 _m_) (Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) and XAD-16 (Sigma) were used in column chromatography. TLC plates were illuminated under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. For preparative HPLC, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, ODS Phenomenex,, Luna column (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 _m_m), and pre-Column (50 x 10.00 mm) were used in this study. For semi-preparative HPLC, a Supelco ODS column 8 (250 mm x 10 mm x 5 _m_m) was used. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All EIMS spectra were obtained by direct insertion of the samples, using an electric cone potential of +70 eV.\n\n### Plant material\n\nLeaves from _C. turbinata_ DC Rodr. were collected at the Viro Reserve, in the State of Para, in October 1996 and February 2000. Dr. Ines Cordeiro identified the specimen, and a voucher No. Cord-2367 was deposited in the Herbarium of the Sao Paulo Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\n_C. turbinata_ were collected twice, and the plant material obtained (1.0 kg), were dried, powdered and extracted with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) and EtOH, successively, affording extracts A and B, respectively, after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. Extract B was dissolved in MeOH:H2O (80:20) and partitioned with hexane. The hydroalcoholic fraction was partially evaporated to MeOH:H2O (60:40), and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOHAc, and _n_-BuOH. All fractions were preliminarily screened with b-carotene solution on TLC for antioxidant compounds. The EtOHAc fraction (1.0 g after solvent evaporation) was dissolved in MeOH (5.0 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH.

Entre eles, a 1,2-diidro-3B-hidroxi-7-desacetoxi-7-oxogedunina e uma substancia inedita. Alem disso, alguns deslocamentos quimicos da kilocensina k foram corrigidos e os dados de RMN \\({}^{1}\\)Ha 7-desacetyledonina sao descritos pela primeira vez na literatura. Seis dos limonoides isolados foram submettios a ensaios com fornigas _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_ e apresentaram attividade insecticide moderada.\n\nNine limonoides were isolated from _Carapa guianensis_ and _Cedrela fissilis_. Among them, 1,2-dihydro-3B-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin is a new compound. Moreover, the assignments of some chemical shifts of xyloccensin k have been corrected and \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR data of 7-deacetyledonin have been assigned for the first time. These isolated limonoids were assayed on _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_ workers showing moderate insecticidal activities.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe family Meliaceae includes many plants that are sources of valuable timber and many that have wide-ranging uses in ethnomedicine. The family is distinguished by the occurrence of characteristic substances called limonoids.[1] These substances have wide spectrum of biological activities,[2] particularly insecticidal action.[3]\n\nThe leaf-cutting ants of the genera _Atta_ and _Acromymex_ use mostly fresh plant fragments to raise their symbiotic fungi[4, 5] and are the cause of considerable economic damage, due to defoliation that they cause.[6] Control of this pest is still problematic, presenting only temporary effects and is sometimes, harmful to the environment, to man and other animals.[6, 7] Consequently, an extensive search for alternate methods to control these insects has been made in an attempt to substitute traditional agrochemicals with agents that yield faster decay, higher specificity and, therefore, less damaging to the environment. In this context, plants are considered a promising source for less toxic compounds that could be used as a soft control method.\n\nAs a part of our search for new natural insecticides against leaf-cutting ants[8] and because of the fact that limonoids have displayed biological activity towards a variety of insects, we decided to investigate the effect of limonoids isolated from two species of Meliaceae family, _Carapa guianensis_ Aubl. and _Cedrela fissilis_ Vell. on _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_.\n\n_Carapa guianensis_ is a tall tree that grows wild throughout South America, West India and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in areas of the Amazon rainforest, that are rich in soils and swamps. From the nuts of this plant is extracted an oil, called andiroba oil, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, such as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, anti-parasitic and as an anti-cancer remedy.[9, 10, 11, 12]\n\nAndiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic and linoleic acids, together with 2-5% of unsaponificable material. In addition, from several parts of _Carapa guianensis_ have been isolated limonoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, flavonoids and diglycerides.[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]\n\n_C. fissilis_ tree, known as \"cedro\" (cedar), is a valuable source of timber. In Brazil, it can be found from the Amazon forest as far south as Espirito Santo State. Previous investigation of fruits and seeds from this species\n\n## Page 2\n\nafforded the limonoids fissionide, mexicanolide and 3b-hydroxyisomexicanolide.19\n\nExtracts and fractions from _C. fissilis_ and one commercial _C. guianensis_ oil showed to have activity against _A. sexdens rubropilosa_ workers.20,21 In the herein study we report the insecticidal activities towards _A. sexdens rubropilosa_ of six gedunin derivatives limonoids obtained from these active fractions besides spectroscopic data for 1,2-dihydro-3b-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**), 7-deacetylgedunin (**6**) and xyloccensin k (**9**).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe chemical investigation of one commercial andiroba oil sample afforded seven limonoids: 17b-hydroxyazadiradione (**1**), gedunin (**2**), 6a-acetoxy-gedunin (**3**), 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**4**), 1,2-dihydro-3b-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**), methyl angolensate (**8**) and xyloccensin k (**9**). Moreover, from roots and leaves of _C. fissilis_ were isolated 7-deacetylgedunin (**6**) and photogedunin (**7**) along with limonoids **2**, **3**, **4** and **5**.\n\nCompounds **1**, **2** and **9** have been isolated for the first time from _C. guianensis_ and all the limonoids isolated from _C. fissilis_ are new for this species. Compound **5** is new to the literature.\n\nLimonoids **1**,22**,23 **3**,13 **4**,15 **7**,24 and **825 were identified by comparison of their NMR spectral data to those previously reported in the literature. The 1H NMR data of compound **6** (Table 1) supplement and expand some hydrogen and carbon chemical shifts reported by Ekong and Olagbemi.26\n\nCompound **5** was isolated as a white powder from _C. fissilis_ leaves and from andiroba oil and identified by spectroscopic methods. It is a new compound, whose 3-OH epimer was obtained from _Guarea thompsonii_.27\n\nThe 1H and 13C NMR spectra of **5** exhibited signals at: d_H 7.40 (m), 7.36 (m), 6.36 (s) and d_C 143.0, 141.0, 120.4, 109.9 of a b-furanyl ring; d_H 1.13 (s), 1.12 (s), 1.08 (s), 0.98 (s), 0.84 (s) and d_C 27.4, 20.9, 17.1, 16.9, 14.8 related to five _tert_-methyl groups; d_H 5.45 (s), 3.83 (s) and d_C 167.3, 65.7, 53.6, 78.1 corresponding to a lactone D-ring with an epoxide between C-14 and C-15. These features are characteristics of compounds classified in the gedunin group of limonoids. However, the NMR spectra of compound **5** lacked signals related to the A-ring a,b-unsaturated ketone. In contrast, signals were observed at d_H 3.26 (dd, 11.0 and 5.0 Hz) and d_C 78.2. These signals indicated an equatorial hydroxyl group at C-3. Thus, limonoid **5** was identified as 1,2-dihydro-3b-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and its spectral data allocations (Table 1) were established unequivocally through 1D and 2D NMR experiments.\n\nCompound **9** was isolated as a white powder from andiroba oil. It is classified as belonging to the mexicanolide group of limonoids and contains a tetrahydrofuran sub-unit with an oxygen bridge linking from C-3 to C-8. It was also isolated from the seed of _Xylocarpus granatum_.28 However, we found through 2D NMR spectra analysis that some chemical shifts were incorrectly determined by Kokpol _et al._,28 among them H-17, H-28, H-29, C-8, C-17, C-18 and C-29.\n\nThe chemical shift of C-17 was deduced from 1\\(J\\) correlation between H-17 (d 6.28, s) and one carbon at d 76.5. H-18 (d 1.00, s) was assigned through 3\\(J\\) correlation between the methyl hydrogens and carbonicl carbon at d 76.5 (C-17). Furthermore, H-28 (d 1.12) and H-29 (d 0.67) were determined through 3\\(J\\) correlation to C-3 (d 91.4). Finally, the 2_J_-_J_ correlations among H-30 (d 2.52, dd, 12.4 and 6.1 Hz), H-2 (d 2.98, br t, 6.1 Hz) and a quaternary carbon at d 85.2 established C-8.\n\nSome of the limonoids isolated from _C. guianensis_ and _C. fissilis_ were evaluated for their effects on _A. sexdens rubropilosa_ ants. The results (Table 3) showed that control and limonoid-treated groups had on average the same\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} H / C & d_H_ of **5** * & d_C_ of **5** * & d_H_ of **6** * \\\\\n1 & & 38.3 & 7.11 d (_J_ 10.2 Hz) \\\\\n2 & 1.75 m & 26.9 & 5.85 d (_J_ 10.2 Hz) \\\\\n3 & 3.26 dd (_J_ 11.0; 5.0 Hz) & 78.2 & \\\\\n4 & & 39.5 & \\\\\n5 & 1.29 dd (_J_ 14.1; 3.1 Hz) & 56.8 & 2.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nsurvival medium time. Compound **3** showed significant difference to the control according to the log-rank test (p < 0.05), which takes into account the whole test period. The gedunin type limonoids do not seem to be highly active against these ants. Indeed, _C-seco_ limonoids, such as azadirachtin, are more active insecticidal compound, possessing both antifeedant and growth-regulating activities.2,29 The toxicity for the ants observed for the _C. fissilis_ and _C. guianensis_ extracts seems not to be related only to the presence of the limonoids. Perhaps the limonoids act in synergism between them or with other compounds in the extracts.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nThe 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using Bruker DRX-200 and ARX-400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. HPLC was carried out using a preparative LC-8A Shimadzu system with SPD-6AV Shimadzu UV detector.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe roots and leaves of _Cedrela fissilis_ Vell. were collected in Sao Carlos-SP, Brazil in June 01, 2001 and identified by Dr. Maria Ines Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, where a voucher specimen (6701) was deposited. The commercial andiroba oil sample was purchased in Belem city (Para, Brazil), in 1996.\n\n### Isolation of the limonoids from Carapa guianensis\n\nA portion of andiroba oil sample (21.0 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield the four corresponding fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (2.6 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 267 x 38 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane-MeOH gradient) to give three fractions. The second fraction (Ac2; 2.3 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 264 x 45 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & HSQC & & HMBC \\\\ \\cline{2-5} Carbon & \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) & \\(\\delta_{\\text{H}}\\)(\\({}^{J}\\)Ca) & \\({}^{2}\\)J\\({}_{\\text{C,H}}\\) & \\({}^{3}\\)J\\({}_{\\text{C,H}}\\) \\\\\n1 & 214.9 & & & \\\\\n2 & 49.0 & 2.98 br (_J_ 6.1 Hz) & 214.9 & 85.2 \\\\\n3 & 91.4 & 4.23 d (_J_ 6.1 Hz) & & 43.0\n\n## Page 4\n\n(hexane-MeOH) yielding five fractions. Limonoid **5** (Ac2,4,2; 17.7 mg) was isolated from fraction four (Ac2,4; 458.2 mg) using column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 444 x 24 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane:CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH gradient). The fifth fraction (Ac2,4,5; 409.0 mg) of this last step was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 475 x 24 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane:CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH gradient) to give seven fractions. Fraction three (Ac2,4,5,3; 19.8 mg) was subjected to preparative HPLC (Hypersil 5\\(m\\) column, 290 x 10 mm i.d., eluted with hexane:isopropanol (9:1), flow rate: 3 mL min-1, detector UV at 240 nm) and the limonoid **9** (Ac2,4,5,3,4; 2.7 mg) was isolated.\n\nAnother portion of the antiroba oil sample (150.0 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield four fractions (FH, FD, FA, FM). Fraction FA (19.0 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 309 x 38 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane:CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH gradient) to give nine fractions. Several chromatographies of fractions five, seven and eight (FA5, FA7 and FA8) afforded limonoids **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **8**, as described below.\n\nThe fifth fraction (FA5; 1.1 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 269 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH) to afford nine fractions. The limonoids **2** (FA5,6,4; 4.5 mg) and **3** (FA5,6,3; 1.5 mg) were isolated from fraction six (FA5,6; 30.1 mg) by preparative HPLC (Asahipak GS-310 2G polymeric column, 500 x 22 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH (100%), flow rate: 5 mL min-1, detector UV at 220 nm).\n\nFraction seven (FA7; 338.4 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 466 x 24 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH) to afford seven fractions. The fourth fraction (FA7,4; 164.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 420 x 24 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH) to yield five fractions. Through preparative HPLC (Asahipak GS-310 2G polymeric column, 500 x 22 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH (100%), flow rate: 5 mL min-1, detector UV at 220 nm) of fraction two (FA7,4,2; 38.9 mg) were isolated the limonoids **4** (FA7,4,2,3; 5.8 mg) and **8** (FA7,4,2,4; 17.4 mg).\n\nFraction eight (FA8; 342.9 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 342 x 24 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH) to afford six fractions. The fourth fraction (FA8,4; 195.4 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 473 x 24 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2;acetone-MeOH) to yield nine fractions. Limonoid **1** (FA8,4,6,2; 6.6 mg) was isolated from fraction six (FA8,4,6; 15.3 mg) through preparative HPLC (Hypersil 5\\(m\\) column, 290 x 10 mm i.d., eluted with hexane:isopropanol (9:1), flow rate: 3 mL min-1, detector UV at 240 nm).\n\n### Isolation of the limonoids from Cedrela fissilis\n\nThe powdered air-dried roots from _C. fissilis_ were extracted by maceration for three times (72 h) with hexane, dichloromethane and and/or methanol at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. A portion of the hexane extract (3.5 g) from roots of _C. fissilis_ (RH) was submitted to VLC on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (704 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh), and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1) to give 5 fractions (**A->E**). Fraction **E** was twice chromatographed as above to give four fractions. Fraction **E-4** was submitted to HPLC [Asahipak GS-310 2G polymeric column, 500 x 22 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH (100%), at a flow rate of 5 mL min-1, detector UV at 254 nm] affording **2** (13.1 mg) and **3** (2.5 mg).\n\nThe powdered air-dried leaves from _C. fissilis_ were extracted by maceration as described above. The CH2Cl2 extract (29.0 g) from leaves of _C. fissilis_ (LH) was submitted to VLC as described to the hexane extract from roots (RH). The CH2Cl2-soluble fraction (6.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (70-230 mesh)-florisil (1:1), with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient to afford 9 fractions (A->I). Fraction **D** was three times chromatographed with hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3.5:0.5) to give **4** (8.3 mg) and **6** (5.1 mg). Fraction **I** was also chromatographed three times over silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (7:2:1) yielding 9 fractions.

They had a combined body mass of 20-25 mg. Before assaying the nests were supplied daily with leaves of _Eucalyptus_ sp., out seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such as _Hibiscus_ sp., _Ligustrum_ sp. or rose petals. Fifty ants were randomly removed from the nests and distributed to five Petri dishes (ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assays the ants were maintained on an artificial diet consisting of glucose (50 g L-1), bacto-peptone (10 g L-1), yeast extract (1.0 g L-1) and agar (15 g L -1) in distilled water (100 mL).30 The diets (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of limonoids (experiment) or without (control) were supplemented daily in small plastic caps. The control was prepared with the diet and the solvent. The compounds were poured into the hot diet immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration of the limonoids added to the diet was 100 mg mL-1. To ensure that undetectable remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants, a comparison was made with another set of dishes in which water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not shown). During the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at a temperature of 25 (+-1) degC and relative humidity ranging between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation was 25 days and the number of dead ants was recorded daily.\n\nThe survival average 50% (S50) was calculated and survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted software Graph-Pad(tm) using the log-rank test.\n\nFigure 1: Limonoids isolated from _Carapa guianensis_ and _Cedrela fissilis_.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. Maria Ines Salgueiro Lima for collecting and identifying the _C. fissilis_ specimen and to the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES) and Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) for the financial support.\n\n## Supplementary Information\n\nSupplementary data are available free of charge as PDF file at [http://jbcs.sbaq.org.br](http://jbcs.sbaq.org.br)\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Da Silva, M.

The compounds 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one and limonexic acid were isolated for the first time from the _Spiranthera_. These furoquinoline and 2-arylquinol-4-one alkaloids and limonoids showed insecticidal and/or fungicidal activity in the nest of the _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_.\n\nSpiranthera odoratissima, furoquinoline alkaloids, limonoids, _Atta sexdens rubropilosa, Leucoagarcius gongylophorus_\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Spiranthera odoratissima_ St. Hil. (Rutaceae), popularly know as Manaca, is a shrub found in the savannah and forest of Central Brazil, and in Bolivia.[1] In folk medicine is used in the treatment of rheumatism, gout, kidney infections, urinary retention, abdominal pains, acne and boil.[2] According to Matos _et al._,[3] the ethanolic extract of the _S. odoratissima_ roots contain compounds with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.\n\nIn previous phytochemical studies of _S. odoratissima_ roots and leaves were reported to contain furoquinoline and \\(\\beta\\)-indoloquinazoline alkaloids, coumarin, terpene, steroid and limonoids.[4, 5]\n\nLeaf-cutting ants (Hymenoptera) are dominant herbivores in the tropics and can be found from the United States Southern to Northern Argentina countries.[6] They cultivate a symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, thus they are considering plague.[7] Therefore, the biological control of these insects has been the aim of many studies.\n\nIn this work was determined the toxicity of crude extract and compounds isolated from _S. odoratissima_ branches in nest of the _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR, \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR and 2D correlations spectra were obtained using Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, with CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) and acetone-\\(d_{6}\\) using TMS as internal standard.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nFor ESIMS analysis, low resolution, was used on triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument. GC/MS (EI) analysis was used a QP5000 Shimadzu, capillary column DB 5MS (30 m, 0.25 mm id, film 0.25 mm). The temperature was programmed initially at 70 degC for 4 min, them increased with a rate of 10 degC min-1 to 280 degC respectively, injection volume was 1 mL in a split mode and temperatures of the detector/ injector were 300 /280 degC. The mass selective detector at 70 eV with scans from 50 to 500 u.\n\n### Plant material\n\nBranches of _S. odoratissima_ were collected in Rio Verde-Jatai, GO, Brazil in January/2001 and identified by Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani. Voucher specimens (4778) were deposited at the Institute of Bioscience herbarium of the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n### Compounds extraction and isolation\n\nThe dried and powdered branches (1.1 kg) were subsequently extracted with _n_-hexane (1.9 g), CH2Cl2 (7.2 g) and MeOH (16.7 g). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The CH2Cl2-EtOAc fraction (4.1 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluting with a _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient to give 3 fractions A-C. Fraction A (34.4 mg) was fractionated as above, _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient. The fraction A-1 (15.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding **1** (7.8 mg). Fraction B (689.3 mg) was fractionated using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient yielding 26 fractions. The fraction B-15 (37.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding **2** (8.7 mg). Fraction B-16 (210.1 mg) was fractionated using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (3.5:6:0.5) and yielded 32 fractions. The fraction B-16.27 (44.5 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (0.5:4:0.5) yielding **3** (7.4 mg). Fraction C (2.1 g) was fractionated using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 70 fractions. The fraction C-34 (397.5 mg) was fractionated using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient and fraction C-34.86 was purified by preparative TLC using CH2Cl2-acetone (4:1) and yielded **4** (18.0 mg). Fraction C-67 (40.4 mg) was fractionated by TLC using CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:3) yielding **5** (5.0 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was submitted to liquid partition with _n_-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The union of the _n_-hexane and CH2Cl2 fractions (510.0 mg) was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH, MeOH-CH2Cl2 (4:1, 3:2 and 1:1) to give 38 fractions. Fraction 22 (89.0 mg) was submitted to centrifugational chromatography (Cromatroton) using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 10 fractions. Fraction 22-2 (20.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using _n_-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (1:8:1) and yielded **6** (16.0 mg).\n\n### Identification of the isolated compounds\n\nThe isolated compounds were identified using NMR, MS techniques. The furoquinoline alkaloids, dictamine (**1**), g-fagarine (**2**) and skimmianine (**3**) presented spectral data in agreement with the literature.8-9 1-Methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (**4**)10: Amorphous solid, EIMS _m_/z (rel. int. %) [M+] 235 (100), 207 (71), 178 (6), 165 (11), 102 (19), 89 (9), 77 (17), 51 (11). Limonexic acid (**5**)11: Amorphous solid. ESIMS, _m_/_z (rel. int. %): 501 [M-H]-(100). Limonin (**6**)11: white solid, mp 295-299 degC; ESIMS, _m_/_z_ (rel. int. %): 469 [M-H]-(100).\n\n### Fungicidal bioassay\n\nThe fungus _Leucoagaricus gongylophorus_ (Singer) Moller (syn _Rozites gongylophorus_) was isolated from an _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_ laboratory nest.\n\nThe medium for fungus maintenance and methods for the bioassays were previously described.12 Solvent (_n_-hexane or dichloromethane or methanol) or solution of each extract or solution of compounds (1.0 mL) were added to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L+): glucose (10.0), sodium chloride (5.0), peptone (5.0), malt extract (10.0) and agar (15.0). Control tubes received 1.0 mL of solvent and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes were autoclaved at 121 degC by 15 min and then slanted. The final concentration of _n_-hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts were 1000 mg mL-1 and of the compounds **1**, **2** and **3** were 50 mg mL-1. The fungal suspension was prepared by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1.0 g L-1) and gently fragmented. This suspension (1.0 mL) was spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at 25 (+-1) degC for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two sets of five tubes each). Fungal growth was estimated macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and density using the modal value.\n\n### Leaf-cutting ant insecticide bioassay\n\nThe _A. sexdens rubropilosa_ workers used in the assays were randomly removed from laboratory nests. They had \n\n## Page 3\n\na body mass of 20-25 mg. Before the assays the nests were supplied daily with leaves of _Eucalyptus sp._, oat seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such as _Hibiscus sp._, _Ligustrum sp._ or rose petals. Fifty ants were removed from the nests and put into five Petri dishes (ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assay the ants were maintained on an artificial diet prepared with glucose (50.0 g L-1), bacto-peptone (10.0 g L-1), yeast extract (1.0 g L-1), and agar (15.0 g L-1), in distilled water (100 mL).13 The diet (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of compounds (experiment) or without (control) were offered daily in a small plastic cap. The control was prepared with the diet and the solvent. To ensure that undetectable remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants, a comparison made with another set of dishes in which water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not shown). The compounds were poured into the hot diet immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration of the extracts added to the diet were 2000 mg mL-1 and of the compounds 100 mg mL-1 or 500 mg mL-1. During the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at a temperature 25 (+-1) degC and relative humidity ranging between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation was 25 days and number of dead ants was registered daily.\n\nThe survival median 50% (S50) was calculated and survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted software Graph-Pad(tm) using the log-rank test.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe compounds isolated from dichloromethane crude extract of the _S. odoratissima_ branches were dictamine(8), g-fagarine(2), skimmianine(r) (3), 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4), limonexic acid (5) and limonin (6) (Figure 1). The 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4) and limonexic acid (5) were isolated for the first time from the _Spiranthera_.\n\nCompounds **1**-**3** were identified by comparison of NMR spectral data with those described in the literature,8,9 and the structures of compounds **4, 5** and **6** were confirmed on the basis of 1H NMR, EIMS and ESIMS spectra, and carbon attributions that were made by HSQC and HMBC correlation spectra.\n\nThe _S. odoratissima_ branches crude extracts showed high inhibitory activity on _L. gongylophorus_ growth and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present insecticidal activity on _A. sexdens rubropilosa_ ants.\n\nThe _n_-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol crude extract (1000 mg mL-1) showed 100% of inhibitory activity on symbiotic fungus (_L. gongylophorus_). The activities of compounds **1**-**3** were comparable to those of extracts above. However, **1** and **2** were more fungicide than **3**, the two first inhibiting fungus growths at 100% and the later 80%. The compounds **4, 5** and **6,** were not tested in this bioassay. These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids are the potentially active compounds in the fungicidal bioassay of dichloromethane crude extract. The fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids skimmianine, kokusaginine, maculine, dictamine, flindersiamine and quinolone obtained from Rutaceae family,10,14 already had been described in literature as powerful inhibitors of symbiotic fungus growth.\n\nThe _n_-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic extracts were tested in ants (_A. sexdens rubropilosa_) ingestion bioassay (Table 1) and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present insecticidal activity. In contrast with high fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids against the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ants, the ingestion bioassay showed that compounds **1** and **2** showed weak activity in ants ingestion assay, which had S50 ranging from 11.0 and 14.0, respectively, while in the control S50 was 15.0. Only compound **1** presented statistic difference in comparison with control (Table 2), according to the log-rank test (_p_ < 0.05), which considered all tested period. Compound **3** was tested in previous work15 and showed not be toxic to the leaf-cutting ants. Compounds **4**-**6** isolated from dichloromethane and methanolic extracts showed toxicity against leaf-cutting ants (Table 3). The ants survival median (S50) were in the 7th and 4th day of the experiment, respectively, compared with the control (S50 = 12 days) for\n\nFigure 1.: Molecular structures of the compounds isolated from _S. odoratissima_ branches extracts: **1**: dictamine, **2**: g-fagarine, **3**: skimmianine, **4**: 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one, **5**: limonexic acid and **6**: limonin.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (**4**) and limonin (**6**) in concentration of 500 mg mL-1.

Pinto\n\n# Abstract\n\nSix triterpenes and eight limonoids were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit the growth of three human tumour cell lines, breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5). The mechanisms involved in the observed cell growth arrest of the four most potent compounds were carried out by studying their effect in cell cycle profile and programmed cell death. The results showed that one triterpene (odoratol) and two limonoids (geduin and cedrelone) caused cell cycle arrest while only the limonoids geduin and cedrelone were found to be very potent inducers of apoptosis.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nCancer represents one of the most severe health problems worldwide and the development of new anticancer drugs and more effective treatment strategies are fields of utmost importance in drug discovery and clinical therapy. Based on significant advances in cancer biology, much of the research in these areas is currently focused on cancer-specific mechanisms and the corresponding molecular targets [1].\n\nNatural products have been the major sources of chemical diversity driving pharmaceutical discovery over the past century. Many natural products and synthetically modified natural product derivatives have been successfully developed for clinical use to treat human diseases in almost all therapeutic areas [2]. In fact, plant-derived compounds have played an important role in treatment of cancers, and some of the most promising and effective drugs have come up from plant sources like taxol8, camptothecin, combrestatin, vinblastine and vincristine. These drugs have also been the major source of new drug candidates for cancer chemotherapy [3]. Apart from these, many other plant-derived compounds are now in clinical trials as anticancer agents.\n\nOne of the most interesting groups of plant natural products is the triterpeneoid group. Over the past decade, coming to the foreground of interest due to their diverse biological effects are a large group of cyclic triterpenoid-like substances which comprise more than 4000 different identified compounds so far. Triterpenoids are studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, hepatoprotective, analgesic, antimicrobial, antimicotic, virostatic, immunomodulatory and tonic effects. They are used in prevention and treatment of hepatitis, parasitic and protozoal infection and above all, for their cytotoxic effects [4].\n\nFrom a biological point of view, most important triterpeneoid structures are oleanane, ursane, lupane and dammarane triterpenoids. However, in what concerns the anticancer effects, not many triterpeneoid compounds have been so far studied. Among these, the lupane triterpene betulinic acid and the ursane triterpenes boswellic acid and ursolic acid have been exhaustively studied for their anti-cancer effects.\n\nBetulinic acid, which belongs to the lupane group, has been investigated intensively for its anticancer activity. Betulinic acid was found to exhibit the cytotoxic effects against human melanoma cell lines MEL-1, 2 and 4 having the IC50 ranging from 0.5-1.6 mg/ml and dose dependent fragmentation of DNA with induction of apoptosis occurred 24 hours after administration [5]. Cytotoxic effects of betulinic acid were also found in other cell lines including ovarian A2780, OVCAR-5, GROV-1, large cell lung cancer NCI-H460, epidermoid carcinoma A431, melanoma Me665/2/21, Me665/260, small cell lung cancer POGB and POGB/DX doxorubicin resistant with the IC50 values ranging from 1.5-4.5 mg/ml. However, it showed lower toxicity to non-tumor cell lines such as HDFC (normal dermal fibroblasts, IC50 = 10.2 +- 1.5 mg/ml) and PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes, IC50 = 50 mg/ml), in comparison with doxorubicin (HDFC, IC50 = 0.38 mg/ml; PBL, IC50 = 0.02 mg/ml). Interestingly, betulinic acid was markedly more effective than cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and radiation on the primary cancer cells isolated from glioblastoma multiforme [6]. It was demonstrated also that one of the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid and its derivatives was apoptosis induction which was mediated by increasing permeability of the mitochondrial membrane which disturbs the transmembrane potential, causing the release of cytochrome-_c_ and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), with the resulting activation of caspases 3 and 8. Subsequent cleavage of the substrates and nuclear fragmentation thus occurred [7]. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL proteins suppresses activation of caspases and other markers of apoptosis of neuroectodermal origin [8]. Furthermore, betulinic acid was found to exert its cytotoxic effect against human glioma cell lines\n\n## Page 2\n\n(LN-229, U87, MG, T98G, LN-18 and LN-308) and an increased level of the proapoptotic protein Bax was observed 24 hours after treatment with butulinic acid. The induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for activation of caspase 3, also occurred [9]. On the other hand, clones of these cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl-2, showed reduced ROS without activation of betulinic acid induced apoptosis. These findings were in accordance with the fact that the antiapoptotic properties of Bcl-2 are connected with antioxidative defence mechanisms. This underlines the importance of producing ROS in the induction of apoptosis by betulinic acid. Betulinic acid is also an inhibitor of the enzyme aminopeptidase N which takes part in the angioproliferative and metastatic activity of tumors. From a clinical perspective, it is interesting to point out that betulinic acid exhibits its greater effect in an environment with a pH lower than 6.8, which is the case for the majority of tumors [10]. Tellingly, in contrast to non-cancer cells, cancer cells subjected to hypothermia showed increased sensitivity to betulinic acid [11].\n\nFor the ursane group, boswellic acid and its derivatives were found to be cytotoxic to glioma cell lines [12]. In animal model, depending on dose, they caused an increased passage of cells to apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival after implantation of cell lines of malignant glioma C6 [13]. Derivatives of boswellic acid were found to induce differentiation in leukemic cell lines in low concentrations and in high concentrations they led to apoptosis [14]. The antiproliferative effects of these derivatives are connected to their ability to inhibit both topoisomerase I and IIa, whose activity is critical for the proliferation of cancer cells. Acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid (AKBA), originally isolated from _Boswellia serrata_, was found to inhibit constitutive STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription-3) in human multiple myeloma cells [15]. Activation of STAT3 has been linked with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and angiogenesis of tumor cells, including human multiple myeloma. Thus, agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential as cancer therapeutics. Lipophilicity of boswellic acid derivatives allows them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and thus renders them the potential for use in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS. Concerning this, they were found to show higher inhibitory effects against glioma cells than those of the clinically used anticancer agents camptothecins [16] and etoposide [12]. Furthermore, derivatives of boswellic acid are shown to be suitable for palliative treatment of progressive or relapsing brain tumors, due to, among other things, their anti-edematous properties [17]. Another interesting member of the ursane group is involic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid in higher plants. This compound was found to show inhibitory activity against mammalian DNA polymerases \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and human DNA topoisomerases I and II. It also inhibits bovine DNA polymerase \\(a\\), rat polymerase \\(b\\), HIV reverse transcriptase. It was also found to lower transcription of COX-2 by inhibition of the signal pathways PKC and AP-1. As the expression of PKC and AP-1 is elevated in a number of tumors, thus targeting these molecules is one of the aims of antiproliferative therapy [18].\n\nOne of the most important members of the oleanane group is oleanolic acid which is present in high concentration in the ginseng root and it showed a range of antitumor effects. Oleanolic acid was shown to induce differentiation in the teratocarcinoma cell line F9 [19]. Furthermore, it was found to exhibit also antimutagenic and antiangiogenic activities [20, 21]. In addition, it also stimulates the release of NO and TNF-a, including induction of iNOS activity and TNF-a expression in macrophages. This effect is mediated by its ability to activate DNA binding to the transcription complex NF-kB and thereby its activation. Maslinic acid, another oleanane triterpenoid which is present in high concentrations in the protective wax-like coating of olives, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of HT29 colon cancer cells [22]. Treatment with maslinic acid resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death in colon-cancer cells. Mechanism study has revealed that maslinic acid inhibited considerably the expression of Bcl-2 whilst increasing that of Bax. It also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-_c_ and activated caspases 9 and 3. Finally, for the damamarane group, fomilletic acids A and B, the secondary metabolites of basidomycete _Fomillea frazinea_, were shown to inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and human DNA topoisomerase I and II. It exhibited also cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines NUGC-3, and PC-12 where differentiation was observed with subcytotoxic concentrations [23].\n\nIn the course of our research program on isolation, synthesis and evaluation of anticancer activity of plant natural products, we have evaluated the capacity of two dammarane type triterpenes (**1** and **2**), four triucallane type triterpenes (**3-6**, Fig. **1**) and eight \n\n## Page 3\n\nlimonoids (**7**-**14**, Fig. **2**) to inhibit the _in vitro_ growth of three human tumor cell lines namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small cell lung cancer (NC1-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5). Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the four most active compounds was also investigated for their effects on the cell cycle profile and the programmed cell death of the NCI-H460 cells.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### General Experimental\n\n1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, at ambient temperature on a Bruker ARX 400 instrument operating at 400 and 80 MHz, respectively. The Shimadzu LC-6AD model HPLC equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-6AV UV detector (240 and 215 nm) and a Biodex Asahiba GS-310 2Ga column (400 x 25 mm, 5mm particle size) was used. For column chromatography, Silica gel 60 (Acros organics) and Sephadex LH 20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB) were used. Solvents were from Synt and reagents were from SIGMA, unless otherwise stated.\n\n### Extraction and Isolation of the Compounds\n\n_Isolation of Cabraleadiol (1) and Octillone (2)_\n\nFruits of _Cabralea canjerana_ (Vell.) Mart. was collected in Federal University of Viosa, MG, Brazil. The plant material was identified by T.D. Pennington of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (UK). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de Engenaharia Flowerstal, Dendrologia of the Federal University of Viosa.\n\nAfter removing seeds, dried fruits (460g) were ground and extracted with ethanol (3 x 500 mL), at room temperature and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 88 g of a concentrated ethanolic extract which was dissolved in 400 ml of a 3:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O. The aqueous methanolic solution was partitioned successively with hexane (2x300 ml), CH2Cl2 (2x300 ml) and E6OAc (2x300 ml) to furnish hexane (47.4 g), dichloromethane (5.4 g) and ethyl acetate (4.4 g) fractions. The hexane fraction was applied over a silica gel column (250 g) and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, eight 700 ml fractions were collected as follows: fr 1 (hexane), fr 2 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 1:1); fr 3 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 3:7); Fr 4 (hexane), fr 5 (CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 1:1); fr 6 (EtOAc), fr 7 (EtOAc-MeOH, 1:1); fr 8 (McOH), Fr. 2 (120 mg) was placed on a gel permeation column of Sephadex LH-20 (50 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of MeOH-CH2Cl2 to afford three 250 ml subfractions. Subfr 2 (88.6 mg) was chromatograph on a silica gel column (15 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of hexane-Me2CO to give five 100 ml fractions. Frs 3 and 4, after evaporation of the solvent by reduced pressure, afforded, respectively, 24.4 mg of cabraleadiol (**1**) and 16.3 mg of ocotillone (**2**) whose structures were established by 1H and 13C NMR as well as comparison of their spectral and physical data with those reported in the literature [24, 25].\n\n### Isolation of 7-Deacetoxy-7-Oxogedunin (7) and 6-Acetoxygedunin (10)\n\nFruits of _Carpa guianensis_ Aubl. were purchased from the city of Belem (Para State, Brazil). Dried and ground fruit arid (160g) was extracted with MeOH (3 x 500 ml) at room temp. The methadonic solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 40 g of the crude methanol extract which was dissolved in 150 ml of a 4:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O and then partitioned with hexane (3x 150 ml) and EtoAc (3x 150 ml) to give, respectively 23 g and 15 g of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. The ethyl acetate extract was\n\nFig. **(2)**: Structure of limonoids (**7**-**14**) evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\napplied to a flash column chromatography of silica gel (200 g) and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-Me2CO -MeOH gradient, and 50 ml fractions were collected as follows: frs 1-2 (hexane), frs 3-6 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 7.3), frs 7-18 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 1:1), frs 18-21 (CH2Cl2, frs 22-23 (CH2Cl2, 7.3), fr 24 (CH2Cl2-Me2CO, 1:4), frs 25 (150 ml, MeOH). Purification of fr 8 by isocitrate HPLC, using a mixture of MeOH/CH2Cl2 (7:3) as solvent and a UV detection at 254 nm, yielded 32.1 mg of 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**7**) and 55.8 mg of 6-acetoxygedunin (**10**) whose structures were established by comparison of their 1H and 1NNMR data with those reported in the literature [26].\n\n### Preparation of Acetonide of Odoradol (5)\n\nOdoradol (4, 25 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of acetone and one drop of conc.H2SO4 was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, under N2 atmosphere, for 3 h after which the solution was evaporated and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was washed with H2O to remove H2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent gave 15 mg of acetonide of odoratol (**5**).\n\nIsolations of the triucnaline triterpenes odoratone (**3**), odoratol (**4**), 22-hydroxytrinculan-7, 24-diene-2,3-diene (**6**) and the limonoids gedunin (**8**) and 7-deacetoxyedunin (**9**) from _Cedrela odorata_ grafted on _Toona clata_ var. _anstrulis_ have been described previously by de Paula _et al._[27, 28]. Isolation and characterization of the limonoids 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazadirone (**11**), credclone (**12**), toonacilin (**13**) from _Toona clilata_ were described by Neto _et al._[29, 30] while isolation of guyanin (**14**) from _Hortia oreadica_, was reported by Severino _et al._[31].\n\n### Biological Activity\n\n#### Reagents\n\nRPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were from Gibco Invitrogen Co.

Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were freshly prepared just prior to each assay.\n\n#### Cell Lines\n\nThree human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma, ECACC), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, a kind gift from NCI, Bethesda, USA) and A375-C5 (melanoma, ECACC) were grown as a monolayer and routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin), at 37 degC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n\n### Tumour Cell Growth Assay\n\nThe effect of the compounds on the growth of the described human tumour cell lines was evaluated according to the procedure adopted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) in the \"_In vitro_ Anticancer Drug Discovery Screen\", which uses the protein-binding dye SRB to assess cell growth [32, 33]. The plating density of each cell line was 1.5 x 105 cells/ml for MCF-7, and 7.5 x 105 cells/ml for NCI-H460 and A375-C5. Cells were allowed to attach overnight in 96-well plates and were then exposed for 48 h to five serial concentrations of the compounds, starting from a maximum concentration of 150 mM (final concentration). At the end of this incubation period the adherent cells were fixed _in situ_ with 10% TCA (final concentration), washed with distilled water and stained with 0.4% SRB (solubilised in 1% acetic acid). The bound stain was solubilised in 10 mM Tris and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (EAR400 STL-Labinstruments). For each test compound and for each cell line a dose-response curve was made and the value of GI50, corresponding to the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the net cell growth, was calculated as described elsewhere [33]. Doxorubicin, used as a positive control, was tested in the same manner.\n\n### Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile and Levels of Apoptosis in the NCI-H460 Cell Line\n\nThe compounds with GI50 bellow (or similar to) 10 mM were selected for further analysis of their effect on cell cycle profile and apoptosis. These assays were carried out in the NCI-H460 cells, since they were one of the most sensitive cells to these compounds. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7.5x104 cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degC for 24 h, in order to adhere. Cells were then incubated for 48 h with complete medium (control), the compounds solvent (DMSO) or with the compounds at their respective GI50 concentrations (determined by the SRB assay). Cells were then harvested and further processed for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection.\n\nFor cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 5 mg/ml propidium iodide. Cellular DNA content (for cell cycle analysis and presence of sub-G1 peak) was then analyzed as previously described [34], using an Epics XL-MCL Coulter flow cytometer, plotting at least 20,000 events per sample.\n\nApoptosis was analyzed using the Human Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis Kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of phosphatidylserine externalization was processed using a flow cytometer plotting at least 20,000 events per sample (as above).\n\nBoth cell cycle distribution and apoptosis data were analyzed using the FlowJo 7.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). At least three independent experiments were carried out and results are presented as the average and standard error (SEM) of those experiments.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSix triterpenes (Fig. **1**) and eight limonoids (Fig. **2**) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the _in vitro_ growth of three human tumour cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5), using the protein-binding dye suflorhodamine B (SRB) method and their growth inhibitory effect, expressed as GI50 (mM), is shown in Table **1**.\n\nFollowing a continuous exposure for 48 h, all six triterpenes (**1-6**) and only four limonoids (**8**, **11**, **12**, **13**) were found to be active against all three tumour cell lines whereas the other four limonoids (**7**, **9**, **10** and **14**) were inactive (Table **1**). The triucnaline triterpene odoradol (**4**) and the limonoids gedunin (**8**), 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b -epoxyazadirone (**11**) and cedrelone (**12**) showed strong cell growth inhibitory activity, presenting their GI50 values below 12 mM for all three cell lines. Interestingly, the limonoid cedrelone (**12**) was found to be not only the most active growth inhibitor but also more selective on NCI-H460 (GI50 = 2.77 +- 0.07 μM) and A375-C5 (GI50 = 2.60 +- 0.21 μM) cell lines when compared to odoradol (**4**), gedunin (**8**) and 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazadirone (**11**). While the damamame calabreadiol (**1**) showed moderate activity in all three cell lines (GI50~30 μM), the triucnaline triterpenes odoratone (**3**) and 22-hydroxytrinculanalla-7,24-diene-2,3-diene (**6**) showed moderate growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but strong activity against A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, the damamare triterpene cocillone (**2**) showed only weak inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but moderate activity against A375-C5 cells whereas the limonoid toonacillin (**13**) showed weak inhibitory activity against all three cell lines. Though carbaleaediol (**1**) and cocoillone (**2**) are both 20, 24 - epoxydamame, they differ only in the stereochemistry of C-24 and the functional group on C-3. With the C-24\\(S\\) configuration and the hydroxyl \n\n## Page 5\n\ngroup on C-3, cabraleadiol (**1**) exhibited _ca._ three times higher in growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells than that of octillone (**2**) which has a ketone function on C-3 and the opposite configuration of C-24. However, the growth inhibitory effects on the A375-C5 cells are similar for both compounds. In fact, cabraleadiol (**1**), isolated from various plant sources, has been previously tested for its cytotoxicity against various tumour cell lines. Phongmayrkin _et al._ [35] reported a weak cytotoxic effect of this compound, isolated from _Chisocheton penduliflorus_ (Meliaceae), on a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Qiu _et al._ [24] have found no cytotoxic effect of cabraleadiol (**1**), isolated from _Aglaia lawii_, on the LNCaP, Col 2 and KB cancer cell lines. On the other hand, octillone (**2**), isolated from _Bentala plaphylla var. japonicum_, was evaluated against a variety of human cancer cell lines, and was found to show no cytotoxicity against the KB (human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx), K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and COLO205 (colon carcinoma) cell lines. Interestingly, though (**2**) did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against KB-C2 (ocochine-resistant KB) cells (IC50 values >100 nM), it was found to show moderate cytotoxic activity (with IC50 ranging from 20.6 to 64.2 mM) in the presence of 2.5 mM colchicine. The enhanced cytotoxicity of octillone (**2**) against KB-C2 cells in the presence of 2.5 mM colchicine as compared with that in the absence of colchicine, suggesting that this triterpene might show some MDR-reversing effects [25]. For the trivellanae triterpenes, odorad (**4**) was the most active analogue exhibiting GI50 values in the rank of 10 mM. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 of odoratol (**4**) by a ketone group in odoratome (**3**) caused a two fold decrease of the growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cell lines; however this structural alteration did not affect the growth inhibitory activity against the A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, transforming the _vic_ diol functionality on the furan ring of odoratol (**4**) into its acetonide (**5**) led to a loss of activity.\n\nConcerning the limonoids, the most active analogue was cedredone (**12**), exhibiting GI50 values below 5 mM in all three cell lines. Although the capacity of cedrelone (**12**) to inhibit the _in vitro_ growth of human tumour cells have not been previously reported, this compound is known to demonstrate several other activities including insecticide [36], antifeedant [37] and antifungal activity [38]. Although its growth inhibitory effect was _ca._ two folds less than that of cedrelone, the structurally related limonoid 6a-acetoxy-14b,15p-epoxyazadironne (**11**) also exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three cancer cell lines. Interestingly, Maneerat _et al._ [39] have found that 6a-acetoxyepoxyazadione, isolated from _Chisocheton siamsis_ and which differs from **11** only in the presence of the carbonyl group on C-16 of the former, was inactive against oral human epidermal carcinoma (KB), small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Among the limonoids whose structure possessing the lactone moiety on the ring D, sedunin (**8**) was the only member which exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three human tumour cell lines (GI50 <= 10 mM); however 7-deacetylgedunin (**9**) was inactive. Interestingly, Brandt _et al._ [40] have evaluated, among several analogues, gedunin (**8**) and 7-deacetylgedunin (**9**), obtained from necem oils, for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cell lines. While godun (**8**) was found to exhibit strong antiproliferative activity against both cell lines (IC50 = 8.84 +- 0.03 for MCF-7 and 3.22 +- 0.6 for SKBr3), 7-deacetylgedunin (**9**) showed only moderate activity (IC50 = 28.96 +- 4.48 for MCF-7 and 21.09 +- 5.95 for SKBr3). Godunin (**8**) was also shown to manifest anticancer activity _via_ inhibition of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) folding machinery [41] and to induce the degradation of Hsp90-dependent client proteins similar to other Hsp90 inhibitors [42].\n\nIn order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the most active compounds, they were assayed for their effect on the cell cycle profile of the NCI-H460 cells. Thus, NCI-H460 cells were treated with odoratol (**4**), gedunin (**8**), 6a-acetoxy-14b,15p-epoxyazadironne (**11**) and cedrelone (**12**) at their respective GI50 concentrations (values of GI50 for NCI-H460 from Table **1**) for 48 h and processed for cell cycle analysis. Results (Fig. **3**) show that the majority of the compounds tested (with the exception of **11**) affected the normal cell cycle distribution of the NCI-H460 cells. Odoratol (**4**) was found to induce a cell cycle ar \n\n## Page 6\n\nrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% cells in this phase upon DMSO treatment to 70% of cells following treatment with this compound), causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 13%) and G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 11%) phases of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with sodium (**8**), the cell cycle progression was blocked (arrested) in the S phase (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 60%), leading to a decrease in the % of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). Incubation with credclone (**12**) caused an accumulation of cells (arrest) in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 40%) and the G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 43%) phases of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the % of cells in G1 (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). In addition, there were indications that odoratol (**4**), gedunin (**8**) and credclone (**12**) induced apoptosis because of the increase in the sub-G1 population of cells when compared to control. Therefore, a specific apoptosis assay was carried out.\n\nIndeed, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was performed to determine the % of cells in early and late apoptosis (and necrosis) by flow cytometry, following treatment of NCI-H460 cells with the selected compounds. Results showed that for all tested compounds, but very modestly for odoratol (**4**) and 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**), the % of cells in early (annexin V positive, PI negative) or late apoptosis (annexin V-positive, PI positive) were increased upon treatment of cells with the GI90 concentration of the compounds (Table **2**). Gedunin (**8**) caused an increase in cell death from approximately 12.6% in controls for 11.2% in DMSO control) to 47.2% in cells treated for 48 h with the GI50 concentration of this compound. Indeed, credclone (**12**) was particularly effective in inducing programmed cell death, causing 80.3% of cell death upon 48 h treatment of the cells with its GI50 concentration. It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the observed apoptotic inducing effects, particularly the effects on caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be investigated, by analyzing the levels of Bax and other apoptosis related proteins, such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. This would be possible by analyzing extracts of cells treated with the compounds (with or without caspase inhibitors) for the levels of apoptosis associated proteins, by Western Blot with appropriate antibodies, as has been carried out by others for example in order to study the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by lupeol [43].\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nSix triterpenes (two dammaranes and four triucallanes) and eight limonoids, isolated from the members of the families Meliaceae and Rutaceae, were evaluated by the SRB method for their cytotoxic effect against three human tumour cell lines. The triucallane triterpene odoratol (**4**) and the limonoids gedunin (**8**), 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**), credclone (**12**) were the most active inhibitors of cell growth (GI50 less than 12 uM). Of these, credclone (**12**) has shown to be the most active growth inhibitor, presenting GI50 values below 4.20 uM in all three tested cell lines.\n\nFrom the analysis of the cell cycle profile in NCI-H460 cells, it was possible to conclude that odoratol (**4**)** arrests cell cycle at the G1 phase, gedunin (**8**) causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase and credclone (**12**) at the S and G2M phases while 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**) did not affect the cell cycle profile of these cells. In addition, analysis of programmed cell death indicates that odoratol (**4**) and 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**) cause a very small increase in cell death but gedunin (**8**) and particularly credclone (**12**), are very potent inducers of programmed cell death. In conclusion, credclone (**12**) is very potent by causing cell cycle\n\nFig. (3).

As a number of recently studied triterpenoids compare very favourably with drugs in current use [44], it is foreseeable that attention of many research institutions and pharmaceutical companies will be drawn to this class of compounds.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), I&D 4040/2007, FEDER, POCI, Capes/FCT (GRICES) and FAPESP.

Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of _H. oreadica_, _H. brasiliana_ and _H. superba_ searching for other secondary metabolites present in substantial amounts for taxonomic analysis. In a continuation of the investigation of the _H. oreadica_, three new limonoids have now been isolated 9a-hydroxylortiolide A, 11b-hydroxyhortiolide C and 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxycinnabin. All the isolated compounds from the _Hortica_ species reinforce its position in the Rutaceae. With regard to limonoids the genus produces highly specialized compounds, whose structural variations do not occur in any other member of the Rutaceae, thus, it is evident from limonoid data that _Hortica_ takes an isolated position within the family. In addition, _H. superba_ afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen, which may not be a genuine natural product. Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle-spinning \\({}^{13}\\)C nuclear magnetic resonance, X-Ray fluorescence and Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy experiments show that the Sephadex LH-20 was modified after treatment with NaOCl, suggesting that when xanthotoxin (8-methoxy-psoralen) was extracted from cleaning of the gel column, chlorination of the aromatic system occurred.\n\n## Keywords:\n\n_Horia oreadica_; _H. brasiliana_; _H. superba_; Rutaceae; limonoids; alkaloids; coumarins; dihydrocinnamic acids; Sephadex LH-20; chlorination \n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nPrevious investigations of _H. oreadica_ reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids [1-3]. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of _H. oreadica_, _H. brasiliana_ and _H. superba_. Three new limonoids have now been isolated (**1**-**3**), **1** and **3** from taproots and **2** from stem of _H. oreadica_. In addition, _H. superba_ afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (**4**) from branches (Figure 1).\n\nHalogenate natural products are widespread, though not particularly common. Hypohalite (HOX) is the halogenating species produced by haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. This may be considered as a source of electron-deficient halogen (X+) that can react with an electron-rich centre in the substrate, as the coumarins. In contrast, the most common types of halogenated coumarins are those with a prenyl epoxide ring, which was cleaved under acid conditions (H+/Cl-). There is some suspicion that these compounds are artefacts of the isolation procedures. These compounds are a comparatively rare group isolated from Rutaceae plants such as in _Toddalia asiatica_ [5,7-dimethoxy-6-(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)coumarin], _Murraya paniculata_ [7-methoxy-8-(1-hydroxy-2-chloro-3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin, 7-methoxy-8-(1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin], and in _Triphasia trifolia_ [7-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)-8-(3-methyl-2-oxobutyl)coumarin, 5-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)psoralen] [4-6]. Aromatic systems react with chlorine in an electrophilic substitution reaction, in which chlorine acts as the electrophile (Cl+), whose presence is rare in the isolation procedures. 3-Chloro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-chromen-2-one appears to be unique as natural metabolite in the coumarin class, which was isolated from leaves of _Ficus krishnae_, Moraceae [7]. Most of the phytochemical studies on Rutaceae genera have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed coumarin containing chlorine in the 1-benzopyran-2-one skeleton if they had been present. In developing countries, as in Brazil, where universities and research funding agencies cannot afford Sephadex (LH-20) in sufficient quantities for scientific studies, using cleaning gel with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a common practice. However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of Sephadex LH-20 and hypochlorite in the formation of compound **4**, until the cleaning gel is analyzed by solid NMR, X-Ray fluorescence (XRF), Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), Infrared (IR), and Fourier transform Raman (FTR) to confirm whether this can serve as an efficient chloronium ion supplier.\n\nFigure 1: Compounds isolated from _H. oreadica_ (**1**–**3**), _H superba_ (**4**), and model compounds.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n## 2 Results and Discussion\n\n### Structure Elucidation of New Compounds\n\nThe spectra of compounds **1**-**4** can be seen in Figures S1-S30 in the online Supplementary. Compound **1** showed spectral characteristics close to those of hortiolide A (**5**) (C27H32O7; Figure 1), which has previously been isolated from _H. colombiana_ (_H. colombiana_ = _H. brasiliana_) [8]. HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H32O8 for compound **1**, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with **5**. The main change observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound **1** was the presence of a signal of a hydrogen of a hydroxyl group at d 2.94 (s). This hydrogen at d 2.94 showed HMBC correlation with the 13C-NMR signals of C-8 (d 90.2). The methyl proton signal at d 1.52, assigned to Me-19, showed cross peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-1 (d 178.8), C-5 (d 42.3), C-10 (d 50.6), and at d 80.5 (quaternary), allowing the assignment of the last signal to C-9, since it was the only carbon left in the skeleton for a 3\\(J\\). These correlations indicated the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-9. The relative stereochemistry of compound **1** was determined from gNOESY experiments. The nOes of the H3-19 (d 1.52), H3-18 (d 1.21) and H3-30 (d 1.71), coming from 9-OH (d 2.94), required the 9-OH to be _syn_ (a) to Me-18, Me-19 and Me-30. The structure of the new natural product **1** was thus established as 9a-hydroxyhortiolide A. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of hortiolide A (**5**) [9].\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \\hline\n**H** & **1** & **2** & **3** & **H** & **4** & **4 \\(\\ast\\)** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & & & 4.04 (brd, 4.2) & 3 & 6.45 (d, 9.8) & 6.46 (d, 10.0) \\\\\n2a & 5.45 (s) & 5.49 (s) & 2.94 (dd, 16.8, 4.2) & 4 & 8.15 (d, 9.8) & 8.17 (d, 10.0) \\\\\n2b & & & 2.58 (dd, 16.8, 1.4) & 2’ & 7.70 (d, 2.2) & 7.72 (d, 2.2) \\\\\n5 & 2.61 (m) & 2.71 (dd, 5.7, 3.3) & 2.25 (dd, 13.7, 2.6) & 3’ & 6.92 (d, 2,2) & 6.93 (d, 2.2) \\\\\n6a & 2.57 (m) & 3.43 (dd, 18.8, 5.7) & 1.78 (m) & 8-OMe & 4.29 (s) & 4.28 (s) \\\\\n6b & & 2.41 (dd, 18.8, 3.3) & 1.88 (m) & & & \\\\\n7 & & & 4.56 (t, 2.6) & & & \\\\\n9 & & & 2.72 (dd, 12.6, 6.6) & & & \\\\\n11a & 1.41 (m) & 4.4\n\n## Page 4\n\nCompound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) to hortiolide C (**6**) isolated previously from dichloromethane extract of taproots of _H. oreadica_[2].

The signal for H-12 was coupled to the 1H signal at d 4.43 (d, \\(J\\) = 4.8 Hz) assigned to H-11, indicating a hydroxyl group at C-11. HREIMS showed the molecular formula C27H32O9 and confirmed the structure **2** for this compound. In the g-NOESY experiments, the nOes of the H3-19 (d 1.54) and H3-30 (d 1.80), coming from H-11 (d 4.43), required the 11-OH to be _anti_ (b) to Me-18 and Me-30. Thus, the structure of compound **2** was proposed as 11b-hydroxyhortiolide C.\n\nThe NMR spectra and extensive analysis of 2D-NMR spectra (Table 2) suggested the ichangin-type (7) [12] framework for compound **3**. Some of the changes observed in the NMR spectra were signals for the presence of a secondary acetoxyl group (13C signals d 169.6, 21.4, 1H signal -OCOMe d 2.15). A significant downfield shift for C-1 (d 80.0), when compared with ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7), determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. The 13C signal at d 80.0 showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 4.04 (brd, \\(J\\) = 4.2 Hz), which showed cross-peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-3 (d 169.4), C-19 (d 65.6), and C-9 (d 43.3). The 1H signal at d 4.04 and a methyl signal at d 2.15 showed long-range correlation with the 13C-NMR signals at d 169.6, confirming an acetoxyl group at C-1. A second change observed in the 13C-NMR spectra was the replacement of the resonance for a carbonyl by signal for an oxymethine carbon at d 73.2, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 4.56 (t, \\(J\\) = 2.6 Hz). A hydroxyl group must thus be connected to C-7 due to the observed correlations of the 1H signal at d 4.56 with the 13C-NMR for C-5 at d 53.6, C-8 at d 43.0 and C-30 at d 18.4. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7). The NOE of the H-1 (d 4.04) coming from H-5 (d 2.25) and H-9 (d 2.72) were weak but definite, suggesting a spatial proximity of H-1a to H-5a and H-9a, and confirming the acetoxyl group in the b-configuration as in ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7, S* configuration at C-1) [12]. In addition, the NOE of the H-7 (d 4.56) coming from H3-30 (d 0.95) required the hydroxyl group at C-7 to be _anti_ (a) to H3-30 (b). The structure of the new natural product **3** was thus established as 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxycinchangin. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of ichangin (7) [12].\n\nThe coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (**4**) was not separated from xanthotoxin (**8**) and isopimpinellin (**9**). The 1H-NMR in addition to signals described in the literature for **8** and **9**, revealed signals nearly the same as that of **9** (Table 1). In addition four methoxyl group signals were observed at d 4.27, 4.16 (6H), and 4.29, which were placed at C-8 in **8**, C-5 and C-8 in **9** and at C-8 in **4**, respectively, by NOE experiments. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of coumarins if C-5 is unsubstituted the doublets arising from H-3 and H-4 are found at _ca_ d 6.2 and 7.6, respectively. The downfield shift of the H-4 to about d 8 0.0 occurs in C-5 alkoxyl-substituted coumarins, as in **9** in comparison with **8**[13]. Hence, the doublets at d 7.76, 8.11 and 8.15 were assigned to H-4 for **8**, **9**, and **4**, respectively, and indicating that C-5 was substituted in **4**. This mixture was analyzed by GC-MS (Figures S26-S29 in supplementary), which established that the coumarins were xanthotoxin (**8**), isopimpinellin (**9**), and indicated the compound **4** to contain chlorine, determining the position of this halogen at C-5, whose spectroscopic properties accord with the above data. This mixture was also analyzed by ESI-MS (Figure 30 in supplementary), which showed protonated molecule ([M + H+]) at _m/z_ 251.5 and ([M + H+]) 253.5 for compound **4**. Simulation of isotope ratio mass spectrum for C12H7O4Cl provided the differences in \n\n## Page 6\n\nnaturally-occurring isotopic abundances, which showed peaks similar to those found for compound **4**, the [M+2 + H+] (_m/z_ 253) peak about one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak ([M + H+] _m/z_ 251), confirming the presence of chlorine. Although, the structure of **4** has been described as being a synthetic product and the 1H-NMR data for both are in close agreement with the structure proposed 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen [10].\n\n### Sephadex LH-20 Analysis\n\nThe mixture of coumarins **4**, **8** and **9** was purified by gel permeation column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20, which was repacked with cleaning gel with sodium hypochlorite (0.8% watery solution). Sephadex LH-20 is cross-linked dextran which has been hydroxypropylated to yield a chromatographic media with both hydrophilic and lipophilic character [14,15]. Solid-state cross-polarization/magic-angle-spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS 13C-NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural product formed by the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite. Pure Sephadex LH-20 and the gel, which was washed only with sterile distilled water and allowed to swell overnight, were used as control. The HETCOR experiment (Figure 2) permitted the assignments of the protonated carbons signals at d 97-94, 72-70, 68-63, and 15-20 to all C-1, C-2-4, C-5-6 and the methyl of propyl group, respectively, comparable with those reported for dextran samples [16,17]. It is clear that water induces no change in chemical shifts as shown in Figure 3. However, it is noted that the treatment with water leads to the increase of the linewidth. Another important observation which should be noted regards the intensity of the signals related to the carbons from glycoside units. For non-treated Sephadex, the hydroxyl groups from glycoside units in different polymeric chains interact through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the structure becomes very rigid, favoring the dipolar coupling. In this case the cross polarization is more efficient and the signals become more intense, even when compared to side aliphatic branches [18]. The 13C-NMR spectrum for cleaning gel (Figure 3) showed that the signals for all C-1 (d 97-94) were of markedly different intensity (lowest intensity), suggesting the oxidation of a-D-glucopyranoses by hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which would result in depolymerisation [19]. In Sephadex LH-20 C-2-4 are hydroxypropylated, thus d-aldonolactone could have glycosidic linkages by hydroxypropyl groups. This spectrum also showed that sodium hypochlorite affected the shape of the 13C-NMR signals for all C-2-4 (d 81-70), suggesting that the oxidation reaction of free -OH at carbons C-2 and C-3 may have occurred. The C-5, C-6 and methyl signals of control and cleaning gel appeared at similar chemical shifts. The CP/MAS 13C-NMR experiments showed that the course of the reaction with hypochlorite is somewhat more complex than the oxidation indicated for C-1, C-2 and C-3. Hypochlorite specifically oxidizes the a anomer, and the initial product formed is a d-aldonolactone (Scheme 1). Although, the free -OH in the glycoside units and in the hydroxypropyl groups must have been involved in the reaction with hypochlorous acid formed in the equilibrium of sodium hypochlorite and H2O, resulting in dextran ether hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which can serve as an efficient chloronium ion supplier [20,21].\n\n\n\n## Page 7\n\nFigure 3: Carbon-13 solid state NMR spectra for pure Sephadex LH-20 and after treatment with water and aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite NaOCI. All the spectra were obtained under CPMAS conditions with total sideband suppression.\n\nFigure 2: Solid state two-dimensional heteronuclear \\({}^{13}\\)C-\\({}^{1}\\)H correlation (HETCOR) NMR for pure Sephadex LH-20, and Sephadex-H\\({}_{2}\\)O-NaOCI.\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\n\n\n**Scheme 1.** Proposed synthetic pathway for hypohalogenation by dextran ether hypochlorite, and reactions of HOCl with Sephadex LH-20.\n\nFurthermore, the shape of the \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR signals for all C-2-4 (6 81-70) is clearer when the ratio A60-90ppm/A20ppm is used for this purpose. For pure Sephadex this ratio is 4.0, for Sephadex-H2O it is approximately 3.3 and for Sephadex-H2O-NaOCl it is 2.0. This variation seems to be quite intriguing, but it is possible that this is related to the exchange of hydrogen by chlorine atoms, which occurred in the polar hydroxyl groups from the glycoside units. Furthermore, the presence of chlorine atoms and water molecules induce the increasing distance between chains. Once these events takes place the cross-polarization \\({}^{1}\\)H\\(\\rightarrow^{13}\\)C becomes less efficient, and the signal becomes less intense as mentioned earlier [18]. In order to observe the possible formation of dextran ether hypochlorite in the structure of Sephadex, \\({}^{35}\\)Cl solid state NMR experiments were run, however no signal was observed (as can be seen in Figure 31 in supplementary). There are few papers in the literature that investigate \\({}^{35}\\)Cl-NMR in organic compounds, and they always involve small molecules [22-24].\n\nField-emission gun scanning electron microscopy analyses of pure Sephadex LH-20, gel washed with water, and gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite showed homogeneous beads in the first two (Figures 4 and S32-S34 in supplementary). In contrast, beads originating from gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite were not homogeneous and some strange material aggregates were observed between and on the polymer beads (Figure 4). These differences suggest modification in the structure of the polymer, or the presence of reaction products with hypochlorite or of salt sodium hypochlorite and HOCl. Comparing the standard gel with those treated with NaOCl shows that there is a decrease in the diameter of some particles, suggesting a dilution or formation of other products (Figure 4D,E).\n\nX-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry was used and the results showed the presence of chlorine in pure Sephadex LH-20, in gel washed with sterile distilled water and cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (Figure 5). The chlorine content was 1.8 fold greater in the gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (0.159%) than that in pure Sephadex LH-20 (0.089%), and 2.9 than that in gel washed with water (0.055%).\n\n\n\n## Page 9\n\nFigure 4: FEG-SEM micrographs of pure Sephadex LH-20 (**A**,**E**) and after treatment with water (**B**) and aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite NaOCl (**C**,**D**).\n\nFigure 5: XRF spectrum of pure Sephadex LH-20 and after treatment with water and aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite NaOCl.\n\n\n\n## Page 10\n\nThese gels were also examined by FT Raman and IR, however, the spectra obtained showed no differences between them which allow verifying the presence of O-Cl bond and lactone (Figure S35 in supplementary). These data suggest that if there were oxidation reactions and the formation of hypochlorite, their yields were low. In their FTR spectra there is a band at 847 cm-1 corresponding to the vibration of the a-anomer, characteristic of Sephadex [25].\n\nGiven that the yield of the reaction with hypochlorite was low, a second hypothesis is that the hypochlorite salt and HOCl retained on Sephadex beads react directly with the active aromatic system for aromatic substitution reactions with HOCl.\n\nConcluding two synthetic pathways to chlorination is possible, in the presence of dextran ether hypochlorite or HOCl retained on Sephadex beads, and when the mixture of xanthotoxin (**8**) and isopimpinellin (**9**) were extracted from cleaning Sephadex LH-20 column, the chlorination of aromatic system occurred in **8** giving 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen. These results showed that the use of cleaning Sephadex LH-20, deserves more attention than it has received so far.\n\n### Identification of Known Compounds\n\nThe major types of rutaceous secondary metabolites were also isolated and they show that _H. oreadica_, _H.brasiliana and H. superba_ are related to other species of _Hortia_. However, the alkaloids _N_-methylatanine, robustine [26,27], 7,8-dehydrorutaecarpine [28], edulitine [29], integriquinolone [30], the coumarins psoralen, bergapten, xanthotoxin, 5-methoxyseselin, braylin, isopimpinellin, prangol, heraclenol, seselin, 5-methoxyseselin [31], the flavonoids isosakuranetin [32], acacetin [29], neoponcirin [33], and the limonoid limonin [34] are reported for the first time from the _Hortia_.\n\nGroppo and collaborators [35,36] studying plants of the genus _Hortia_ showed that _H. brasiliana_, _H. arborea_, _H. colombiana_ and _H. chocoensis_ represent the same arborescent species, and that _H. brasiliana_ V. and ex. DC. _H. badini_ M.A. Lisboa was used to designate individuals of _Hortia_, but this error was corrected by Groppo and collaborators [35], who recognized it as _H. brasiliana_. The name _H. brasiliana_ was wrongly applied to a shrubby species of central Brazil by Saint-Hilaire, today recognized as _H. oreadica_ Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani [35]. _H. superba_ Ducke, _H. regia_ Sandwith and _H. longifolia_ Spruce (ex. Engl) are accepted species in the genus _Hortia_ according to Groppo and Pirani [36]. The known compounds isolated in this work and occurrences in other _Hotia_ species can be seen in supplementary Table S1.\n\n## Experimental Section\n\n### Instrumentation\n\nOptical rotations were measured by using a Perkin Elmer 241 spectropolarimeter, or DIP 370 Jasco.

This machine is equipped with a MAS 4mm broadband solid state probehead. The sample (powdered) was packed in a 4mm zirconia rotor, and a KEL-F cap. The carbon-13 1D spectra were obtained by using a ramped cross polarization under magic angle spinning with total side band suppression (pulse sequence named CPTOSS). These experiments were conducted at 298 K and using a spinning speed of 5000 Hz. The CPTOSS parameters were: contact time of 2 ms, recycle delay of 5 s, acquisition time of 34 ms, spectral width of 295 ppm and 512 scans were averaged. High power decoupling was done by using a TPPM15 decoupler program under a 1H field of 70 KHz. 2D 1H-13C FSLG-HETCOR experiment were run at 10,000 Hz of spinning speed. The pulse sequence parameters were: recycle delay of 2 s, contact time of 200 ms for observing spin diffusion signals, number of scans of 32, LG field of 80 KHz, acquisition time of 16 ms and SPNAL64 for decoupler program at 70KHz of 1H irradiation, and 256 transients were obtained in F1. FSLG-HETCOR was performed at only 298 K, in a total time of 4.5 h. The pulse sequence used for acquiring 35Cl solid state NMR was one pulse with acquisition time of 44 ms, a spectral window of 1200 ppm and the spinning speed was 10,000 Hz. For all the experiments the sample was spun by using gaseous nitrogen. FT Raman: I-Raman 485-H, Laser 785 nm BWTEK (USA). XRF: MiniPal 4, PW 4024, P Analytical B.V. (Almelo, The Netherlands).\n\n### Cleaning Sephadex LH-20 and Repacked Column\n\nWhen a column has been in use for some time, it may be necessary to remove contaminants. Thus the gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by gentle agitation and was allowed to react overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was washed three times with sterile distilled water to remove residual NaOCl. After cleaning, the column was carefully re-equilibrated with 2-3 column volumes of methanol before it is used again. Part of cleaning Sephadex was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis.\n\nThe control gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed only with sterile distilled water by gentle agitation and was allowed to swell overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis.\n\n### Plant Material\n\n_Hortic brasiliana_ V. and Ex. D.C. was collected (May 2000) in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. _H. oreadica_ Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani was collected (September 2005) in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. _H. superba_ Ducke was collected (December 2001) in road from Manaus to Itacoatiara km 31, Amazonas state, Brazil. All the plants were identified by Jose Rubens Pirani of the Department of Botany, University of Sao Paulo, and vouchers are deposited in the herbarium of the same department (Pirani 4672 and Groppo Jr. 458, Groppo Jr. 950, respectively).\n\n\n\n## Page 12\n\n\n\n### Extraction and Isolation\n\nGround taproots (3.3 kg), stems (2.4 kg) and leaves (3.2 kg) of _Hortica oreadica_, stem (938 g), stem bark (270 g) and leaves (655 g) of _H. brasiliana_, stem (938 g), and stem bark (270 g) of _H. superba_ were successively extracted using hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH, at room temperature. Small branches of _H. superba_ were also analyzed, and ground branches (483 g) were extracted 3 times at room temperature using ethanol. All extracts were monitored by 1H-NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS. Only those displaying features of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives and limonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined.\n\nThese extracts were repeatedly purified by silica gel column chromatography (CC, 230-400 mesh), gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH-20), preparative TLC, by the centrifugal preparative TLC performed on a chromatotron of Harrison research 50B, Spectra/Chrom CF1-fraction collector, silica gel 375 mesh, diameter 26 cm, and then by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification (polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G). Details on the isolation can be found in Supplementary Materials.\n\nThe concentrated hexane extract (3.0 g) from the taproots yielded the coumarin 5-methoxyseselin (12 mg).

The pentacyclic triterpenes _b_-amyrin (**1**) and lupenone (**3**) were detected in the stems and flowers, whereas germinec (**5**) was identified in the leaves and stems; and _b_-amyroneone (**4**) was detected in the flowers extract. Further GC-FID analyses of foliar epicircular wax showed the presence of **1, 5** and, taraxerci acetate (**2**). These results clearly demonstrate that the hexane extracts from stems and flowers present higher chemodiversity than the others. On the other hand their chemical profile indicated common major constituents concerning sterols and triterpenes in the analyzed samples evidencing great similarity among the studied plant part extracts.\n\nAltogether, these results corroborate differences in the secondary metabolites production by different plant tissues, which can be relevant from the point of view of the chemical interface between plants and the surrounding environment.18 In this context, several studies indicated variable production of secondary metabolites by medicinal plants.19 Zangerl and Bazzaz reported different levels of frameworks' on _Pastatic saxion syntax_ (Apiaaceae) leaves and roots.20 Likewise, Rees described flowers of _Hypercian hirsutum_ (Clusiaceae) contain five to ten times more hypercian that the leaves.21 Considering that young leaves and other growing plant parts are generally better protected by secondary compounds than mature tissues, young leaves of rosette plants of _Cynoglassum officinale_ (Boragaceae) were found to contain up to 53 times higher levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids than older leaves.22\n\nIn the case of non-polar extracts, bioactivity has been often associated with complex mixtures of triterpenoid and/or steroid compounds23-35. However, no further analysis/identification of the mixture components is subsequently performed in most cases due to two reasons: Firstly, traditional phytochemical procedures, which include isolation of the components from isomeric mixtures, may be tedious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. Secondly, due to their structural complexity the analysis of triterpenes and sterols by spectroscopic techniques has been shown to be difficult in many cases. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has emerged as the best technique for characterization of low-polarity compounds, including triterpenes, sterols, glycerols, waves, and derivatized fatty acids. However, this hyphenated analytical technique is still inaccessible to many research groups around the world. On the other hand, GC is more readily available and might also be employed as a preliminary procedure for rapid, simple, and relatively cheaper characterization of non-polar compounds from plant extracts, including epicircular wax. The present phytochemical screening using HRGC showed to be reliable and useful for the identification of triterpenes and sterols in complex matrices such as hexane extracts and foliar epicircular wax from _P. niens_ (Figure 2). Other interesting applications of this technique include the selection of plant extracts containing bioactive non-polar compounds for further phytochemical and pharmacological investigations, which may represent a crucial step in bioprospecting studies and corroborates its importance as a tool for conducting phytochemical studies.\n\nFigure 2.

Tres das flavonas estao sendo descritas pela primeira vez: 3',4'-metilendodioxi-6,5-(2\",2\"-dimetilipirano)-7-metoxiflavona (**1**); 3',4'-s-trimetoxi-5-hidroxi-6,7-(2\",2\"-dimetil-pirano)-flavona (**2**) e 3',4'-metilendodioxi-5,7,8-trimetoxiflavona (**3**). Cinco substancias conhecidas (**4**-**8**) foram tambem isoladas: 3',4'-metilendodioxi-5, 5',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona; 3',4',5,5',7-pen-tametoxiflavona; 4',5',7,8-tetrametoxiflavona; 3',4',5',7,8-bematecoiflavona. A unica flavancona, 3',4',5,5',7-pentametoxiflavancona (**9**), e conhecida como produto de derivataza, sendo esta a primeira vez que e isolada de plantas.\n\n_Neoraputia alba_ (Rutaceae) yielded eight flavones, besides one flavanone. Among the flavones, three were identified as the new compounds, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,5-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyran)-7-methoxyflavone (**1**); 3',4',8-trimethody-5-hydroxy-6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyran)-flavone (**2**), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7,8-trimethodyflavone (**3**). Five known compounds (**4**-**8**) 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5, 5',6,7-tetramethyl-flavone; 3',4',5,5',7-pentametohxyflavone; 4',5,5',7,8-tetramethyl-flavone; 3',4',5,7,8-pentametohxyflavone; 3',4',5,5',7,8-bematechoxyl flavone were also isolated. The only flavancone (**9**), 3',4',5,5',7-pentametohxyflavone, is known as product of derivatization, however this is its first isolation from plants.\n\n**Key words -** Neoraputia alba; _Rutaceae, flavones._\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe genus _Raputia_ was first described by Aublet in 1775, with the species _R. aromatica_. However, recently, Emmerich1 has renamed it as _Neoraputia_.\n\nIn a previous paper2 we described the isolation of two pyrano flavones of _Neoraputia alba_. Now, we report the isolation and identification of eight flavones and one flavanone from the same plant.\n\n## Experimental\n\n_Extraction and isolation of the constituents_ - Leaves (1.041 kg) of _N. alba_ (a voucher is deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias-USP-Sao Paulo) collected in Espirito Santo, Brazil, were ground and extracted with petrol, CH2Cl2 and MeOH respectively. Solvent evaporation yielded the corresponding extracts. The petrol extract (2.082 g) afforded two flavonoids reported in a different paper2. The methylene chloride extract (14.527 g) was chromatographed on dry column (eluent CH2Cl2:EtOAc 9:1). The column was cut and the silica extracted with MeOH yielding 8 new fractions. Fraction 4 chromatographed over silicagel column yielded (**3**) (116 mg). Fractions 6,7 and 8 after recrystallization afforded (**3**) (86 mg), (4) (231 mg) and (**8**) (54 mg) respectively.\n\nThe methanol extract (18.470 g) was partitioned in MeOH/HfO2/hexane. The methanolic fraction partitioned with EtOAc/HfO/Hf+. The acidic solution was neutralized with NH4OH and extracted again with EtOAc. The resulting EtOAc extract after column chromatography yielded (**3**) (37 mg), (**4**) (118 mg) and (**5**) (121 mg).\n\nFrom a second collect the dichloromethane extract of leaves (20.417 g) after a similar treatment as described above, yielded (**1**) (320 mg), (**2**) (13 mg), (**6**) (410 mg) and (**7**) (36 mg). Other extracts from stems of the same plant were also fractionated yielding the same compounds described above.\n\n_3',4'-Methylenedioxy-6,5-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyran)-7-methyloxyflavone_ (**1**).

The ^1H NMR for compound **1** (Table 1) showed features of a dimethylehromene ring (8 5.56 and 6.58 vinylic protons), a singlet for a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups (d = 1.51). Other signals referring to an ABX coupling system for three protons in the ring **B** (d 87.40\\(d\\), 7.27\\(d\\) and 6.87_d_), a methoxyl (d 3.89) and methylenedioxy (d 6.02) were all well-defined in the ^1H NMR. From MS, the fragments _m_/_z 149 and 146 indicated that the methylenedioxy is fused to the ring **B**, as well as the one _m_/_z 217 requires the chromene fused to **A**. The comparison of these data to those reported for two other flavones isolated from the same plant2, suggests that (**1**) contains one proton in the ring **A**, and a methylenedioxy in **B**. The relative positioning of the chromene ring came from experiments of lanthanide reagent3 (Table 2), which suggested the same arrangement as obtained for the two previously reported flavones2. However, two possible isomers can be drawn for (**1**), which can either have a proton at C-7 and a methyl at C-8 or vice-versa. The decision for the compound containing 7-OMe and H-8 came from both bi-synthetic arguments, where an oxygen atom is required in C-7 rather than C-8, and the chemical shift observed for C-8 (d 91.4) in the ^1C NMR, that would be a very high field for C-7. The structure proposed is also in agreement with the ^1C NMR (Table 3).\n\nCompound **2** showed to be very closely related to (**1**). The ^1H NMR for this compound also showed features of a chromene ring, vinylic and methyl protons (Table 1). Again from ^1H NMR it was possible to assign a disubstituted **B** ring exhibiting a characteristic ABX coupling system. The presence of a chelated hydroxyl (d 12.75) requires a hydroxyl group attached to C-5, as well as the chemical shift observed for C-4 (d 182.3)4. Acetylation of (2) yielded the corresponding monoacetate (2a) (d 2.42). The acetate (2a) also showed a disenlielding for the signal of H-4' ( d 0.21) displaying a linear arrangement for the chromene ring in this molecule. Compound (2) was also methylated yielding (2b), which showed to be an isomer of (10), a flavone described before2, indicating **a** different attachment of the chromene unit to the **A**. Moreover, the addition of lanthanide shift reagent to (2a) in the ^1H NMR showed a large shift for the signals of H-3, H-4' and H-3'' confirming that (2b) is an isomer of (10) (Table 3). Therefore a linear arrangement for the chromene ring was proposed for (2).\n\nCompound (3) showed ^1H NMR signals referring to a methylenedioxy group (d 6.04), three methoxyls (d 3.99, 3.96 and 3.94). Further analysis from the ^1H NMR indicated the disubstituted pattern of the ring **B**, and the presence of one \n\n## Page 3\n\nproton in the ring **A** (SS 6.43) as well. The suggestion that the methylenedioxy should be attached to the ring **B**, appeared from the mass spectrum \\(m/\\!z\\) 146. One further problem was the location of the third methoxyl group in the ring **A**. This was decided on the basis of the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR which showed only one signal for the methoxyl carbons (8 61.58) requiring an _ortho_-disubstituted carbon\\({}^{3}\\). This result conducted to the structure counting 8-OMe, instead of a 6-OMe.\n\nFlavones **4-8** were identified through comparison of their spectral data with the ones described in the literature\\({}^{6-8}\\).\n\nThe use of C6D6 was necessary to decide among some possible isomers, especially for those compounds having three methoxyls in the ring **A**. It has been shown that C6D6 induces a shielding in methoxyl signals, in the \\({}^{1}\\)HNMR, when this group has an _ortho_ hydrogen\\({}^{9,10}\\). Using this experiment together with the chemical shifts observed for the methoxyl carbons in the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR, it was possible to distinguish among the isomers for compounds **4**, **6**, **7** and **8**. For example, when the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR was run for compound **8** in CDCl3 and subsequently in C6D6, a shielding was observed in the signals for four methoxyls. This means that only two methoxyls have no proton in _ortho_ positions. This result led unequivocally to the structure **8** for this flavone. A similar approach was used for the other compounds.\n\nThe only flavanone isolated from this plant was identified on the basis of its spectral data and comparison with those reported in the literature for the same compound\\({}^{11}\\).\n\n\\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data for flavones 1, 2 and 3 (CDCl3 50.32 MHz, 8 scale).\n\n\\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data for flavones 1, 2 and 3 (CDCl3 50.32 MHz,\n\n## Page 4\n\nThe occurrence of polymethoxylated flavones is important for the chemosystematics of _Neoraputia_. This is the second time that this type of compounds has been isolated from this genus. Polymethoxylated flavones have also been found in _Citrus_ species [12, 13]\n\n###### Acknowledgements.\n\nThe authors thank FAPESP, CNPq and CAPES for financial support.
