DOI: 10.1002/ptr.1249 and could hence play a role in the defense of the organism against oxidative stress (Gordon, 1996; Pietta, 2000). Reactivity of ﬂavonoids has been studied under many experimental conditions and towards several free radicals. These investigations have demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of ﬂavonoids is mainly due to radical scavenging properties (Cotelle et al., 1996; Nanjo et al., 1996). In addition, the antioxidant activity of a compound depends ultimately on its ease of oxidation and, for a variety of natural or synthetic compounds, good correlations have been observed between antioxi- dant activities and low oxidation potentials (Born et al., 1996; Chevion et al., 2000). The present work deals with the isolation and identiﬁcation of ﬂavonoids from M. aquifolium, which have inhibited the bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates, and the evaluation of para- meters related to the antioxidant activity by separately measuring their oxidation potentials through cyclic voltammetry and the free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl). MATERIALS AND METHODS General experimental procedures. Silica gel (Merck, 230–400 and 70–230 Mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) were used for column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 or Varian INOVA 500 spectrometers at 200 or 500 MHz, respectively, for 1H NMR, and at 50 or 125 MHz, respectively, for 13C NMR, with TMS as internal standard and DMSO-d6 or MeOH-d4 as solvent.

INTRODUCTION In the course of our systematic studies on the chemis- try of Maytenus species, we have investigated Maytenus aquifolium Martius (Celastraceae), a tree widely dis- tributed in Cerrado region of Brazil. The infusion of M. aquifolium leaves is one of the most popular antiulcer traditional drugs in Brazil (Carlini, 1988) and its effectiveness has been proved in ethanol and/or indomethacin-induced gastric lesion models (Bersani- Amado et al., 2000; Vilegas et al., 1999). Our previous studies on M. aquifolium were carried out on its leaves and root barks and showed the presence of sesq- uiterpene pyridine alkaloids, quinonemethide and friedelane triterpenes (Corsino et al., 1998a; 1998b; 2000). On the other hand, nothing has been reported on the antioxidant properties of the constituents of M. aquifolium. TLC analysis using β-carotene as a spray reagent (Pratt and Miller, 1984) revealed the presence of anti- oxidant compounds in the MeOH extract of the leaves and root bark of M. aquifolium. Their isolation and identiﬁcation as catechins and ﬂavonol glycosides were subsequently undertaken. Flavonoids are acknowledged as having interesting medicinal properties as anti- inﬂammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor activities and are by far the most comprehensively investigated natural products when considering anti- oxidative properties. They are widely distributed in food 914 J. CORSINO ET AL. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytother. Res. 17, 913–916 (2003) obtained on Nicolet and Lambda 14P Perkin Elmer spectrophotometers, respectively. Plant Material. Leaves and root bark of Maytenus aquifolium Martius were collected from a private culture in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo and identiﬁed by Dr Rita Maria de Carvalho. A voucher specimen (number HPM0268) is deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP), São Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation. Dried and powdered leaves of M. aquifolium (4.5 kg) were extracted with ethanol. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concen- trated in vacuum to afford a green gum (896.7 g). The EtOAc soluble part of the EtOH extract (5.3 g) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (300.0 g), eluted with MeOH to give 30 fractions. Fraction 13 (0.234 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300.0 g) and eluted with CHCl3/MeOH gradient to give 10 fractions. Frac- tions 7 and 17 were identiﬁed as compounds 2 (0.089 g) and 3 (0.139 g), respectively. The methanol insoluble part of the EtOH extract (2.0 g) was submitted to Sephadex LH 20 column (100.0 g) eluted with MeOH to give 35 fractions. Fraction 10 was applied to a polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) column (6.0 g) eluted with MeOH to afford 15 fractions, yielding 4 (0.093 g) and 5 (0.034 g) as pure compounds. The dried and pow- dered root bark of Maytenus aquifolium (925.2 g) was extracted with EtOH and concentrated to give a brown gum (17.4 g). The EtOAc soluble part of this extract (2.2 g) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (100.0 g) and eluted with MeOH to give 30 fractions. Fraction 14 was identiﬁed as compound 1 (0.017 g). Bleaching experiments on βββββ-carotene. After develop- ing and drying, TLC plates were sprayed with a 0.02% solution of β-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of back- ground. The remaining yellow spots indicated the pres- ence of antioxidant substances (Pratt and Miller, 1984). Spectrophotometric assay on the reduction of 2,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical. Reaction mixtures containing test samples (dissolved in MeOH) at several concentrations and 0.004% DPPH methanolic solutions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured using a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer at 517 nm and the percent in- hibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH treated control group (Cuendet et al., 1997). Electrochemical assay. The cyclic voltammograms were carried out with a Polarecord E-506 (Metrohm) potentiostat. A three electrode system (663 VA, Metrohm) with a working electrode of glassy carbon (GC), a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a carbon auxiliary electrode was used. DMF (Merck) was used as solvent and tetra-n-butyl ammonium tetraﬂuorborate (Merck), as the supporting electrolyte. Rutin (Aldrich) was used as reference compound for its well known electron-reductive properties [Van Acker et al., 1996; Peyrat-Maillard et al., 2000]. The working electrode was polished with aluminium oxide 0.3 µ (Buehler) and spe- cial polishing cloth (Buehler) prior to each measure- ment, because formation of a polymeric ﬁlm inactivated the electrode after each scan. The electrode was then washed thoroughly with water, dried and cycled several times in the range – 1.6 to + 0.6 V in order to reassure the absence of voltammetric signal due to the supporting electrolyte. Each compound was dissolved to concentrations of 10–20 mM in DMF and added to a 15 mL aliquot of the supporting electrolyte. The solu- tions were then deoxygenated with nitrogen for 10 min and the cyclic voltammograms were carried out at scan rates of 50, 100 or 200 mV/s. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Dried leaves and root barks were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. TLC analysis of the crude extract using β-carotene solution as spray reagent (Pratt and Miller, 1984) revealed the presence of antioxidant compounds. Chromatographic fractionation of this ex- tract guided by the antioxidant assay with β-carotene afforded ﬂavan-3-ols 1–3 and ﬂavonol glycosides 4 and 5 (Fig. 1). Their identiﬁcation was based on spectro- metric data, mainly MS, uni and bidimensional NMR techniques as well as comparison with literature data (Vilegas et al., 1999; Agrawal and Bansen, 1989). Spe- ciﬁc information on the identity of sugar moieties, including sterochemical aspects, and their position of linkage to the aglycone and to other sugar units fol- lowed from extensive analyses of PND and DEPT 135° 13C NMR, HMBC spectra as well as from analyses of coupling constants of the anomeric hydrogen signals on the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 4 and 5. Antioxidative properties of ﬂavonoids 1–5 were evalu- ated against β-carotene (Pratt and Miller, 1984). Com- pounds 1–3 and 5 (10 µg) appeared as yellow spots against the TLC plate white background whereas com- pound 4 (10 µg) appeared as a pale-yellow spot owing to its weaker antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of ﬂavonoids is due to the presence of struc- tural features as ortho-dihydroxy groups (usually on B ring), α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and α- and/or β-hydroxyketone groups, which are responsible for chelating properties or enhancement of the radicalar stabilization after the initial oxidation steps (Bors et al., 1990). The lack of a catechol moiety on B ring and a free hydroxy group at C-3 in ﬂavonol 4 may account for its low ability to protect β-carotene from bleaching and for the higher oxidation potential observed on its cyclic voltammogram when compared to compound 5 (Table 1). These structural features should also be pre- dictive of the poor radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonol 4, when compared to ﬂavan-3-ols 1–3 and to Table 1.

Radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonoids 1–5 and standard compound rutin. which are believed to be the major electrochemically active groups in these compounds. The absence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety conjugated to the B ring accounts for their higher oxidation potential when compared to compounds 4 and 5. The presence of a 4-oxo function on ﬂavonol 4 gave rise to a β-hydroxy ketone group which probably enhances the ease of ﬂavonoid oxidation, resulting in the oxidation peak at + 0.48 V on its cyclic voltammogram. These struc- tural features, in addition to the catechol moiety on the B ring of ﬂavonol 5, conferred the highest stabil- ization ability for this quercetin derivative, resulting in the lowest oxidation potential (+ 0.30V) among ﬂavonoids 1–5. The association of antioxidant and antiulcer activi- ties evidencing gastroprotective effect of antioxidants after stress-induced oxidative damage on gastric mucosa has been demonstrated by several means: through in- duction of anti-lipoperoxidative processes, enhancement of free-radical scavenging and antioxidant enzymes (e.g. glutathione peroxidase: GSH-Px) activity and/or reduc- tion of the main sources of oxygen radicals in such systems, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) (Osakabe et al., 1998; La Casa et al., 2000). Antioxidant-rich fractions (e.g. polyphenols) from plant extracts have been extensively used in experi- mental models to prove their inhibitory effect on induced ulceration. (Osakabe et al., 1998; Vilegas et al., 1999). Pure compounds have also been submitted to antiulcer activity evaluation. The protective effect of rutin, a widespread ﬂavonol glycoside, against ethanol- induced gastric lesions as well as the inhibition of gastric H+, K+ – ATPase by catechins have already been assessed (Murakami et al., 1992; La Casa et al., 2000). The quantiﬁcation of ﬂavonoids in M. aquifolium has been recently performed and showed that ﬂavonols are the major compounds, representing ca 7.6% of the dry EtOH extract (Leite et al., 2001). The presence of sig- niﬁcant amounts of antioxidant hydrosoluble ﬂavonoids in the leaves of Maytenus aquifolium may therefore consist evidence for the efﬁciency of its infusion as an antiulcer agent and legitimate its ethnopharmacological use.

Keywords: Piper hispidum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihy- dropyridone and piperidine moieties have been isolated from Piperaceae species (Parmar, 1997). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insec- ticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of Piper hispidum H.B.K. (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). In this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elu- cidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)-heptadienamide (1), 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one (2) and also of eight known antifungal amides N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3), piper- amine (4), N-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 -pyridin-2-one (5), piplartine (6), piperine (7), a,b- dihydropiperine (8), 5,6-dihydropiperlonguminine (9) and pellitorine (10). The amides isolated from stems of Piper hispidum (1, 3 and 4) and from seeds of Piper tubercu- latum (2, 5±10) were active against the fungus Clados- porium sphaerospermun as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). 2. Results and discussion A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of P. his- pidum was subjected to silica gel column chromato- graphy, followed by HPLC puri®cation to aord the compounds 1, 3 and 4. Compound 1, has a molecular formula C18H23NO3 as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of the 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cmÿ 1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.91 (2H, s), and four ole®nic protons which showed signals at 5.45 (1H, d, J3,4=12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, dd, J4,3 and 4,5=12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, dd, J5,4 and 5,6=12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, dt, J6,5 and 6,7=12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,-unsaturated carbonyl system.

The assignments of these ole®nic protons were con®rmed by analysis of the 1H±1H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylenic protons H-8 at 2.62 (2H, t, J8,7=7.0 Hz) and H-7 at 2.46 (2H, m) were con®rmed by the DQ- COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 ( 5.94, 1H) could be also observed. The presence of a isobutyl moiety was con®rmed by the signals at 3.13 (2H, dd, J100,200=7.0 Hz), 1.80 (1H, m) and 0.92 (6H, d, J300,200 and 400,200=7.0 Hz) attributed to H-100, H-200, H-300 and H-400, respectively. The coupling between H-100 and the NH hydrogen was con®rmed by 622 H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of 1 are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-®eld region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 166.5, ten ole®nic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; ArauÂ jo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of 1 was determined as (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8- (30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide. A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of P. tuberculatum was fractionated by column chromato- graphy on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to aord compounds 2 and 5±10. Compound 2, was shown to have a molecular formula C17H19NO5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of 13C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cmÿ 1 (asymmetric C±O±C stretching). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 revealed the presence of meth- oxyphenyl groups by the signals at 3.84 (6H, s), 3.85 (3H, s), one aromatic proton signal at 6.76 (2H, s) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four ole®nic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at 6.48 assigned to H-8 (J8,9=12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at 6.71 assigned to H-9 (J9,8=12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the Z con®guration. The attribution of this con®guration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the Z isomer when compared with the E isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at 6.89 (J4,3 and 4,5=9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at 3.97 (J6,5=7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-®eld region of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four ole®nic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at 165.7 and 168.1.

H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 623 of the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at 6.48 (H-8) and 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at 165.7 was assigned to C- 2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-®eld region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide 2 was de®ned as 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one. N- (12, 13, 14- Trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 - pyridin -2- one (5), a,b- dihydropiperine (8) and 5,6- dihydropiperlonguminine (9) have the molecular for- mula C17H21NO5, C17H21NO3 and C16H21NO3, respec- tively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), Piper guineense (Par- mar et al., 1997) and P. tuberculatum (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the ®rst time. N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)- propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3) was previously isolated from Piper peepuloides (Shah et al., 1986) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piperamine (4) was previously obtained from Piper nigrum (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piplartine (6) was pre- viously described from Piper aborescens (Duh et al., 1990) and P. tuberculatum (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (7) was previously described from P. aborescens and P. tuberculatum (ArauÂ jo-JuÂ nior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (10) had been reported from Cissampelos glaberrina (Rosario et al., 1996). The antifungal activity of amides 1±10 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds 1±10 are shown in Table 3 and were per- formed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of C. sphaerospermum growth at that level were considered inactive. The minimum quantity of compounds 1±4, 6, 8±10 necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for 7 and 5 the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively. The values for 7 and 5 were comparable to those observed for the reference compounds miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). P. hispidum and P. tuberculatum have accumulated amides with cis geometry in their side chain, which is a structural feature quite rare in nature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1986). 3.

Antifungal assay The microorganism used in the antifungal assay C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de BotaÃ nica, SaÄ o PauloÐSP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay Ð 10 ml of solutions corresponding to 100 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermun in glucose and salt solution (Rahali- son et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25C. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the mini- mal amount of 1±10 required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 mg) and miconazole (0.5 mg) were used as positive controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents The dried and powdered stems of P. hispidum (28.0 g) were extracted with CH2Cl2 (3150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 1 (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 3 (0.004 g). Frs containing 4 were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of P. tuberculatum (24.3 g) were extracted CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromato- graphic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:- EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 2 (0.024 g) and 6 (0.003 g).

Introduction In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) we reported the isolation and characterization of two C- glycosylated anthrones (picramniosides D, E), and two C-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B), as well as emodin and umbelliferone, from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis Tul., a tree found in Central America. Further investigations aorded, in minor quantities, two new C,O-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picramnioside F (1), and an oxathrone, mayoside C (2), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (3) and 8-O-b-d-gluco- pyranosyl emodin (4). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of com- pounds 1 and 2, and the antifungal activity of the iso- lated compounds. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract from the bark of P. teapensis aorded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds 1± 4, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shi- madzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones 3 and 4 were identi®ed on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992). Compound 1 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 671 ([M+1]+), 693 ([M+Na]+) and 709 ([M+K]+), with the base peak at m/z 509 ([M+1- C6H10O5]+). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

E-mail address: djbf@power.ufscar.br (J.B. Fernandes). All of the spectroscopic characteristics of 1 were coincident with those of anthrones which we have pre- viously reported (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at lmax 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cmÿ1), ester carbonyl (1735 cmÿ1) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cmÿ1) groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at 7.4±7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of meta-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at 3.40±3.95, indicating sugar moieties. The presence of 33 carbons was evident from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at 95.8 and 105.4. Signals in the region of 62±81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D±E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agree- ment with lyxose (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on SolõÂs et al. (1995) which identi®ed the sugar of picramniosides A±C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-O were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments con®rmed only one CH2 signal at 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit. Complete assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experi- ments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In parti- cular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) 3J coupling between the ester carbonyl ( 164.7) and H-10, H-200 and H-600, indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-10 of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) 3J coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-50 ( 81.4), con- ®rming the position of the aglycone at C-50 of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a 3J correlation of the anomeric 838 T. RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 837±841 proton of the glucose unit (H-1, 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the O-glucose unit at C-8. The magnitude of the coupling constant between H-50 and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an eq±eq conformation for these protons. The con®guration of the lyxose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (SolõÂs et al., 1995; HernaÂ ndez- Medel et al., 1998; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-10 and H-20 (J=0 Hz) suggesting an eq±eq conformation for these protons. Likewise, the J value of H-5000 (12 Hz) indicated an ax±ax conformation for H-5000 and H-4000 in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety. Further observations helped to establish the con®gura- tion at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of 1 (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picramnioside E (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the fol- lowing expected dierences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to O-glucosylation at C-8. Compound 2 was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of 2 gave pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 709 ([M+Na]+) and 725 ([M+K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]ÿ), which was consistent with the molecular for- mula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS±MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (m/z 563), lyxose (m/z 432), CH2OH (m/z 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corre- sponding to emodin (269). As observed previously for the mayosides (HernaÂ n- dez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed the same pattern described for 1, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of 2 had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). O-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound 2 at ring A. Assignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with pub- lished data (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not aord all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1000 with C-1 ( 162) helped to con®rm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1000. Circular dichroism con®rmed the absolute con®guration at C-10 of 1 and 2 as S and R, respectively.

The compounds mayoside B, picramnioside E, 3, 4, emodin and umbelliferone were tested in the growth inhibition assay of Leucoagaricus gongilophorus, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. (1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds 3 and 4 presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in Sesamum indicum. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material. 3.

Plant material The bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San JoseÂ de la MontanÄ a, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica. 3.3. Isolation of constituents Dried and powdered bark of P. teapensis (615 g) was macerated with EtOH±H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was ®ltered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then n-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml minÿ1 UV detector at 254 nm), to aord compound 1 (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-O-b- (3) and 8-O-b-glucopy- ranosyl emodin (4). Further puri®cation of 3 (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and 4 (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described). Fraction 11 was submitted to HPLC separation under the same conditions (6.5 ml minÿ1, 7 cycles) to aord pure com- pound 2 (1.2 mg, 0.0004% w/w). 3.4.

Subject and source In the course of our continuous search for bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi living in plants from Cerrado and Atlantic Forest (Cafeˆu et al., 2005; Teles et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005), healthy leaves of Cryptocarya mandioccana were submitted to isolation of endophytes and 15 strains were isolated. Among them Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz) Penz & Sacc., was selected for chemical and biological investigation because of the strong antifungal activity of the crude EtOAc extract against the phytopathogenic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium sphaerospermum. C. gloeosporioides was identiﬁed by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited in the fungal herbarium of the Univer- sidade Federal de Lavras (CML 737). 2.

Present study C. gloeosporioides was subcultured in Petri plates containing PDA and incubated for seven days. After this period, it was inoculated at 25e28 C in 20 500 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks, each containing 200 mL of Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB). The cultures were incubated at 25 C and aerated by agitation on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 28 days. The ﬁltered fermentation broth (ca. 4.0 L) was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 1.5 L); the organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and concentrated to yield 195.3 mg of crude extract. The crude extract was cleaned-up in reversed-phase silica gel (C-18) using MeOH as eluent and subsequently pu- riﬁed by reversed-phase preparation HPLC [C-18 column e Phenomenex-Luna (210 21.2 mm), l ¼ 254 nm, 10.0 mL/min, H2O:MeOH (75:25) to MeOH (100%) over 120 min], affording () cis-4-hydroxy-6-deoxyscytalone (1) [22.8 mg, tR ¼ 25 min, aD 25 133 (ca. 0.024, CHCl3)] and (4R)-4,8-dihydroxy-a-tetralone (2) [10.1 mg, tR ¼ 60 min, aD 25 17.7 (ca. 0.018, CHCl3)]. The chemical structure of these compounds was elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectral data and by comparison with those reported in the literature (Venkatasubbaiah and Chilton, 1992; Krohn et al., 2002; Aldridge et al., 1974; Kokubun et al., 2003; Machida et al., 2005). The antifungal activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Rahalison et al., 1991). The detection limit of these compounds required to inhibit growth of the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladospor- ioides and C. sphaerospermum was 5.0 mg, comparable with the positive control nystatin. OH O OH OH OH O OH 1 2 4. Ecological signiﬁcance The strong antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum of the compounds 1 and 2 suggests that the endophytic fungi C. gloeosporioides in C. mandioccana could protect the host by producing metabolites, which may be toxic or even lethal to phytopathogens, and highlights the potential of endo- phytic fungi in producing bioactive metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of C. gloeosporioides as an endophytic fungus inhabiting plants from Brazilian Atlantic Forest and C. mandioccana.

Introduction The Rutaceae family is constituted of about 150 genera with more than 1500 terrestrial species, being considered source of alkaloids, coumarins, ﬂavonoids and limonoids [1]. Hortia is a Neotropical genus of Rutaceae that comprises 12 species, dis- tributed in South America from Panama to the state of São Paulo, Brazil, most of them occurring in the Amazonian region. Xylella fastidiosa a Gram-negative bacterium is transmitted by xylem-feeding leafhoppers (Homoptera, Cicadellidae), and colo- nizes the xylem of plants causing diseases on several economically important crops such as citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) in sweet orange, Pierce’s disease (PD) of grapevine and coffee leaf scorch (CLS) [2]. The generally accepted cause of the symptoms induced by X. fastidiosa is the occurrence of vascular occlusion inside the ves- sel leading to water stress. It was previously demonstrated that the bacterium is able to grow as a bioﬁlm, which could be an important factor for pathogenicity [2]. As part of our efforts to ﬁnd potential lead compounds as bactericidal against this economically impor- tant phytopathogenic bacterium, coumarins, ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivative, anacardic acid, triterpenes and limonoids isolated from Rutaceae, Meliaceae and Anacardiaceae plants were assayed against X. fastidiosa [2]. Triterpene deriva- tives were the most active, guyanin (1), odoratone, gedunin, and ∗Corresponding author. E-mail address: dmfs@power.ufscar.br (M.F.d.G.F. da Silva). azadiractin A showed MIC of 2.9, 2.3, 2.7, and >2.2 × 103 M, respectively. Rutaecarpin (2) and 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid also showed appreciable activity against X. fastidiosa, the MICs were 4.2 and 4.8 × 103 M, respec- tively [2]. Compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) were isolated from H. oreadica taproots [3,4]. The need for novel and more selective agents to treat proto- zoal diseases remains. The classic examples of these diseases are Chagas, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and malaria. African try- panosomiasis or sleeping sickness is caused by T. brucei rhodesiense (East to South Africa) and T. brucei gambiense (West and Central Africa). They affect about half a million people in sub-Saharan Africa and an estimated 60 million people are at risk of contracting dis- ease, which is fatal if untreated [5]. The chemotherapy of these diseases is inadequate due to problems of drugs resistance, vari- able efﬁcacy between strain or species of the causative organisms, toxicity, difﬁcult of administration or requirement of long course of administration [6]. Human malaria is responsible for consid- erable morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is caused by four species P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum. Of these four species P. falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of the 300–500 million episodes of malaria worldwide and accounts for 0.7–2.7 million annual deaths. In many endemic countries, malaria is responsible for economic stagnation, lowering the annual eco- nomic growth in some regions by up to 1.5% [7]. These factors increase the urgency of the search for novel agents to treat protozoal diseases. Highly oxygenated ﬂavones and dibenzoylmethanes have shown to be active in tested for in vitro activity against P. falciparum 0021-9673/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical structures of compounds from H. oreadica. and T. brucei rhodesiense [8]. These promising results have stimu- lated us to test some 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid derivatives for activity against these parasites. Preliminary assay was performed on methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), which showed activity against both P. falciparum and T. brucei rhodesienses. However, compound 3 has been isolated from Hortia oreadica taproots in small amount, and then the MICs were not determined. Compounds 1–3 (Fig. 1) were isolated from H. oreadica taproots [3,4]. Furthermore, if it is assumed that it is possible to modify the chemical structure of compounds in order to improve activ- ity and selectivity on the above assays, phytochemical studies of other organs of H. oreadica deserve more attention. Thus, we have now examined the leaves of H. oreadica since they have never been investigated before. The leaves afforded the known limonoid guyanin (1), the alkaloids rutaecarpin (2) and dictamnine (6), the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4), together with the new E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4- carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) (Fig. 1). Generally, the conventional methods including silica gel, polyamide and reversed-phase liquid chromatography are often used to isolate pure products from H. oreadica, but they are tedious, time consuming and usually require multiple chromato- graphic steps [9–11]. Counter-current chromatography (CCC), a liquid–liquid partition chromatography method, has a track record of being a powerful tool in the preliminary stages of crude extract fractionation [12–15]. With the ability to attain high res- olution, modern CCC and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) instrumentation, such as HSCCC and fast-centrifugal parti- tion chromatography (FCPC), have signiﬁcant potential to develop new approaches in natural product drug discovery, speciﬁcally towards reducing the expensive and time-consuming steps to iso- late active constituents. Due to the lack of a solid stationary phase, CCC has no irreversible adsorption and, therefore, provides loss-less fractionation [16]. Since samples are simply partitioned between different solvents phases, there is 100% theoretical sample recov- ery. In crude plant extract fractionation this is particularly valuable because it minimizes the chances of losing the activity during frac- tionation. This beneﬁt of CCC allows researchers to address the issues of synergy between compounds to explain biological activ- ity in plants, without the need to address potential irreversible adsorption of active constituents to the solid stationary phase dur- ing fractionation [14,17]. Therefore, HSCCC was used for separation and puriﬁcation of compounds 1–6 from dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oreadica. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus The HSCCC instrument employed in the present study was man- ufactured by P.C. Inc., Potomac, MD 20854, USA. It contained a quadruple multilayer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The ˇ value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (ˇ = r/R, where r is the dis- tance from the coil to the holder, and R, the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis and the central shaft). The sample injection loop volume was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus was regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The ﬂow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, NY, USA) constant-ﬂow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector (Eyela, DC-1200); Liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spec- trometry (LC–APCI-MS/MS) data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography equipped with a PDA2996 photodi- ode array detection (DAD) system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaﬂow electro- spray probe; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): on a Bruker DRX 400 and 100 MHz with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal stan- dard; infrared (IR): Bomen-FT-IR; ultraviolet (UV): Varian 500 Scan UV–Vis (visible)-NIR (near infrared); gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS): low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument. For low-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (APCI-MS), a Micromass Quattro LC instrument was used, equipped with a “Z- spray” ion source. 2.2. Reagents All organic solvents used for HSCCC were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and for LC–APCI- MS/MS were HPLC grade purchased from J.T. Baker (Ecatepec, Mexico). Water puriﬁed (18 M<OMEGA>) by areverseosmosisMilli- V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 4277 Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for all solutions and dilutions. 2.3. Plant material The leaves of H. oreadica were collected in January 2001 in Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. The identiﬁcation was carried out by Dr. José Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, São Paulo University and vouchers are deposited in the Herbarium of the same department. 2.4. Preparation of crude sample The leaves (3.2 kg) of H. oreadica were dried carefully by forced air at 40 ◦C and reduced to powder. The powdered dried leaves were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH at room temperature three times. After the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (93.0 g), dichloromethane (161.0 g) and methanol (42.0 g). 2.5. Selection of two-phase solvent system Small amounts of dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. ore- adica were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the compounds allowed to partition between the two phases [18,19]. The distribution of the components between both phases of each the 5 solvents systems were analyzed by thin-layer chromatogra- phy (TLC) using 20 cm × 20 cm silica gel plates with a thickness of 0.20 mm (silica gel 60 F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), on which the crude extract was horizontally spotted. The solvent system used for the development of the TLC plates was hexane–ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v). The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with a solution of vanillin reagent (5 g of vanillin in 9 mL of methanol, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 and 3 drops of acetic acid) followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of compounds into each phase. The partition coefﬁcients were determined by GC–MS only for the best solvent system as follows: 0.5 mg of dichloromethane extract was added to a test tube, to which 5 mL of each phase of the two-phase solvent system was added. The test tube was shaken as above, and then the upper and lower phases were analyzed by GC–MS. The parti- tion coefﬁcients of three compounds in sample were determined according to the peak areas. 2.6. Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution The two-phase solvent system composed of hexane–ethanol– acetonitrile–water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separatory funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The upper phase and the lower phase were separated and degassed by sonication for 20 min shortly before use. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving the dichlorom- ethane extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v). 2.7. GC–MS analysis The partition coefﬁcient and HSCCC fractions were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph ﬁtted with a fused silica DB-5 (30 m × 0.32 mm I.D., 0.25 m ﬁlm thickness) capillary column with helium as the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The temperature was programmed initially at 100 ◦C for 1 min, and then increased with a rate of 10 ◦C min−1 to 250 ◦C, the latter main- tained for 30 min. The injection (1 L) was split and its temperature was 280 ◦C. The interface temperature was 250 ◦C. The chromato- graph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass-selective detector at 70 eV. 2.8. HSCCC separation The upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elution mode. First, the coiled column was entirely ﬁlled with the station- ary phase (lower phase). Then the apparatus was rotated forward at 800 rpm, while the mobile phase (upper phase) was pumped into the column in a tail to head direction at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min−1. The retention of stationary phase (SF) was 85% (SF = 0.85). After the mobile phase front emerged and the hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution con- taining 2.5 g of the dichloromethane extract was injected through the injection module at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min−1. A total of 34 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an automated fraction collector. However, with 24 fractions all compounds obtained have already eluted. 2.9. TLC analysis of fractions obtained by HSCCC All HSCCC fractions collected were monitored by TLC (20 cm × 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254) with hexane–ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v) as the developing solvent. Based on the TLC plates monitoring, all HSCCC fractions were combined into 8 analytically distinct fractions. Fractions 1–2 afforded 5,8- dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4, 0.240 g), fraction 3 furnished E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4- carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5, 0.045 g) and fraction 5 yielded methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6- propanoate (3), (0.148 g). Fraction 4 was ﬂash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with n-hexane–Me2CO (8:2) affording guyanin (1, 0.04 g). Fraction 6 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2–MeOH, 6:4) to give rutaecarpin (2, 0.11 g). Fractions 7–8 were puriﬁed as fraction 6 to yield dictamnine (6, 0.088 g). 2.10. LC–APCI-MS/MS LC–APCI-MS/MS data were acquired using a 3.0 mm × 30 mm, 3.5 m XTerra-MS C-18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively, each one supplemented with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid, TFA): 20% line B at the beginning then goes to 30% B and 30% C in 9 min; the column was then washed with 20% line B and 80% line C for 4 min and re-conditioned with 20% line B for 3 min; a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210–500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post UV-detector splitter was used to send only 0.3 mL min−1 to the ion source; nitrogen was used for nebulization (200 L h−1) and desolvation (785 L h−1); the corona discharge was set at 3.27 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 27 and 4 V respectively; argon (Ar) was used for the fragmentation experiments and the parent ions were accelerated using a collision energy ramp of 1–25 eV. For SRM experiments, the cone voltage was maintained using tune parameters previ- ously optimized for all compounds at 27 V, and two transitions were selected for each compound (Fig. 2): for 1, m/z 499 →397 (monitoring) and m/z 499 →343 (quantiﬁcation), using a collision energy (CE) of 20 eV; for compound 2, m/z 288 →244 (quantiﬁca- tion) and m/z 288 →169 (monitoring) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 3 m/z 307 →203 (monitoring) and m/z 307 →233 (quantiﬁcation) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 4 m/z 293 →201 (monitoring) and m/z 293 →233 (quantiﬁcation) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 5 m/z 4278 V.G.P.

The dwell time was 0.08 s, and the interscan delay was 0.1 s. The col- lision gas pressure (argon) was set at 1.35e−3 mbar for all experiments. 2.10.1. Software All MS data were acquired and processed using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, UK). 2.10.2. Calibration standard and analytical curves Stock solutions (1000 g mL−1) of compounds 1–6 were pre- pared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, HPLC grade, Ecatepec, Mexico). Working solutions were prepared at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 g mL−1 by diluting stock solutions. Calibration standards curves were obtained in triplicates. For each point of the analyt- ical curves, the worst value in comparison with the average was discarded. Calibration curves were obtained plotting concentration (g mL−1) in axis x per area below SRM peaks (arbitrary units) in axis y (average of three runs). 2.10.3. Sample preparation The dichloromethane extract (30 mg) was re-suspended in 3.0 mL of HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) in cen- trifuge tubes by vortex agitation (Phoenix AP56, Araraquara, SP Brazil) for 30 s at the maximum possible speed. The obtained solu- tion was ﬁltered (PTFE Millipore, São Paulo, Brazil, d. 25.0 mm and p. 0.20 m), and then diluted appropriately and used for quantiﬁ- cation of compounds 1–6 by LC–APCI-MS/MS. 2.11. Biological assays Stock solutions of the compounds, plus control drugs, were prepared at a concentration of 20 g mL−1 in dimethyl sulfox- ide (DMSO; Sigma, UK), and diluted to appropriate concentration prior to assays. IC50 values were calculated with MSXLFIT (IDBS, UK). 2.11.1. P. falciparum Chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 was maintained in human A+ erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, UK) sup- plemented with Albumax II at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. P. falciparum intraerythrocytic cultures were set up as above, with 1% ring stage parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit, in triplicate in 100 L of medium in 96 well, ﬂat-bottomed Microtest III tissue plates. Drugs were added in threefold dilution series and cultures incubated for a total of 48 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. After 24 h, {3H} hypoxanthine (0.2 mCi) was added to each well. At the end of the assay, plates were rapidly freezethawed, harvested using a Tomtec Mach III cell harvested (Tomtec, CT) onto a 96-well format ﬁltermat and Meltilex solid scintillant (both Wallac, Finland) added prior to reading in a Microbeta 1450 scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland) at 1 min per well. 2.11.2. T. brucei rhodesiense T. brucei rhodesiense STIB900 blood stream form trypomastigotes were maintained in HMI-18 medium, with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HarlanSeraLab, UK) at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2–air mixture. Prior to drugging, trypomastigotes were washed and re-suspended in fresh medium at a concentration 2 × 105 mL−1, and 100 L of this suspension was added to the drug dilutions. The top concentration for the test compounds was 30 g mL−1. Pentamidine was included as the standard drug. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4–5 h on Gemini ﬂuorescent plate reader (Soﬁmax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a ﬁlter cut-off at 550 nm. 2.11.3. Cytotoxicity assays 96-well plates were seeded with KB cells at a concentration of 2 × 104 mL−1 (100 L per well). Drugs at 300, 30, 3 and 0.3 g mL−1 were added in fresh overlay after 24 h, in triplicate at each con- centration. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4–5 h on Gemini ﬂuorescent plate reader (Soﬁmax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a ﬁlter cut-off at 550 nm.

Results and discussion 3.1. LC–APCI-MS/MS In an attempt to establish a suitable method for quantiﬁcation of compounds in dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oread- ica, this was analyzed by HPLC–APCI-MS/MS using the SRM mode. The content of compounds in the crude extracts is important to determine their recovery in HSCCC analyses. The mobile phase was determined after testing different compositions of solvents. A good chromatographic resolution was achieved using a 9 min gradient, beginning with 20% acetonitrile then going to 30% acetonitrile and 30% methanol. This mobile phase provided both excellent separa- tion between all six compounds and good ionization levels under the APCI ion source. The SRM transitions were chosen on the basis of the stability of product ions obtained under collision-induced dis- sociation (CID)-MS/MS. The second-generation product ion spectra of compounds 1–6 showed intense protonated molecules ([M + H+]) at m/z 499, 288, 307, 293, 313 (m/z 313 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the protonated molecular ion m/z 359), and 200 respec- tively. The product ions chosen to form the transitions in SRM Table 1 Concentration of compounds 1–6 quantiﬁed simultaneously by LC–APCI-MS/MS in dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oreadicaa.

Regression analysis of the least-square line for data acquired from the external stan- dard calibration curves showed good linearity at a 0.01–1.0 g mL−1 concentration range of six compounds, with a correlation coef- ﬁcient above 0.997 for all curves. The content of guyanin (1), rutaecarpin (2), methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1- benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1- benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4), E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy- 4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5), and dictamnine (6) in the crude extract were 2.42%, 4.80%, 5.78%, 9.82%, 1.80%, 4.15%, respectively, and showed RSD ranging from 0.03 to 2.11%, as deter- mined by HPLC–APCI-MS/MS (Table 1). 3.2. CCC solvent system The essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvents. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. However, this is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent. For efﬁcient separation, it is important that the partition coefﬁcient (K) of the target compounds should lie in the range 0.5 < K < 2.0, and the separation factor between any two components (˛ = k2/k1, k2 > k1) should be greater than 1.5. A smaller K value results in a loss of peak resolution, while a larger value produces excessive band broaden- ing. To ensure a satisfactory retention of the stationary phase, the settling time of the solvent system should be shorter than 30 s. In order to avoid wastage of solvent, it is recommended that the two-phase system under consideration produces similar volumes of each phase [20]. It is also essential to consult solvent systems used in countercurrent chromatography that can be found in the specialised literature, e.g. [18,21–23]. Various techniques can be used for analysis of the best solvent system. Thin-layer chromatography is a very rapid way of guiding method development. A small amount of the sample is thoroughly mixed in a vial with equal volumes of the upper and lower phases of the chosen solvent system. The same volume of each phase is applied to a TLC plate which is then allowed to migrate in the 4280 V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 Fig. 4. Mass spectra of compounds 3 (A), 4 (B) and 5 (C), (GC–MS, 70 eV). organic phase of the two-phase solvent system. An optimal sys- tem gives an equal distribution between the two phases and Rf values of the sample components between 0.2 and 0.5. If the sam- ple is found almost exclusively in one phase, the solvent system is obviously of no use. It should be noted that the Rf value gives only an approximate indication of the appropriateness of a par- ticular solvent because TLC involves both partition and adsorption mechanisms, whereas CCC is based on purely liquid–liquid partition phenomena [20]. The following polar two-phase solvent systems were tested: chloroform–methanol–water (5:4:3, v/v), dichloromethane–meth- anol–water (4:5:3, v/v), hexane–ethanol–acetonitrile–water (10:8: 1:1, v/v), hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (3:7:5:5, v/v), hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (1:1:1:1, v/v), hexane– ethyl acetate–methanol–water (5:5:4:5, v/v), hexane–ethanol– methanol–water(10:7:10:8,v/v),hexane–ethanol–methanol–water (10:10:9:11, v/v), and hexane–chloroform–methanol–water (3:6:3:2, v/v). Out of the 9 candidate biphasic solvent systems, 4 were rejected, as the settling times were either too long, emulsions were formed when extract was added, or suitable partitioning did not occur. The remaining 5 solvent systems gave reasonable sepa- ration on TLC, however, only hexane–ethanol–acetonitrile–water (10:8:1:1, v/v) showed similar distribution among the two phases with the Rf values approximately 0.3 between the components, and therefore it was used for the CCC separation. The partition coefﬁcients determined by GC–MS with this solvent system for compounds 3–5 obtained in one-step separation were 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1, respectively. 5,8-Dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran- 6-propanoic acid (4) was obtained in a pure form at tubes 1–11, E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) at tubes 12–14, and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3) at tubes 20–22. The GC–MS of these compounds was shown in Fig. 4. The recovery of com- pounds 3–5 of 2.5 g of crude extract in a one-step separation were 102.5%, 101.2%, 99.0% (Table 1), respectively, which were determined by comparison with HPLC–APCI-MS/MS data. Guyanin (1) was obtained after column chromatography on silica gel, rutae- carpin (2) and dictamnine (6) on Sephadex LH-20, however, their recoveries were also excellent 66.2%, 93.1% and 84.9% (Table 1), respectively. 3.3. The structural Identiﬁcation of the compounds The structures of isolated compounds were identiﬁed on the basis of spectral data, particularly 1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, and APCI-MS/MS, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spec- trum with those from the literature. Compounds 1 and 2 have previously been isolated from Hortia regia [24], 3 and 4 from H. colombiana [25] and dictamnine (6) from H. longifolia [26] (Fig. 1). The new compound E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbo methoxyphenyl) cinnamic acid was identiﬁed as 5 (Fig. 1) on the basis of the following data: Amorphous white solid. UV max/nm (CHCl3) 215, 200, 204; IR max/cm−1 (liq. ﬁlm) 3019, 2927, 2854 (CH), 1734 (carboxyl group,) 1738 (ester), 1626, 1518, 1464, 1441, 1379, 1262, 1215, 756, 669. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 7.22 (1H, d, H-2, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.93 (1H, brd, H-5, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.06 (1H, dd, H-6, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz), 6.87 (1H, d, H-2′, J = 2.0 Hz), 8.22 (1H, d, H-5′, J = 8.4 Hz), 6.99 (1H, dd, H-6′, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz), 3.93 (3H, s, COOCH3), 3.92 (3H, s, 3-OCH3), 3.93 (3H, s, 4-OCH3), 7.95 (1H, s, H-). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): 124.7 (C-1), 112.6 (C- 2), 149.2 (C-3), 148.9 (C-4), 111.3 (C-5), 121.3 (C-6), 118.5 (C-1′), 100.1 (C-2′), 134.3 (C-3′), 135.0 (C-4′), 127.8 (C-5′), 114.6 (C-6′), 176.0 (COOH), 164.1 (COOCH3), 56.0 (COOCH3), 55.8 (3-OCH3), 55.8 (4-OCH3), 152.2 (C-), 158.0 (C-). HMBC (400 MHz, CDCl3): H- →C-1, C-, COOH; H-2 →C-3, C-6; H-5 →C-1, C-4; H-6 →C- 2, C-4; H-2′ →C-, C-1′; H-5′ →C-, C-1′, COOMe; H-6′ →C-1′; 3-OMe →C-3; 4-OMe →C-4; 4′-COOMe →COOMe.GC–MS low res- olution (Fig. 4): 70 eV: m/z (rel. int. %): 312 (100), 297 (31), 269 (15), 226 (10), 141 (15), 127 (13), 119 (23), 91 (15). The ion at m/z 312 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the molecular ion. It is the ﬁrst report of this compound in litera- ture. 3.4. Effect of isolated compounds on P. falciparum, T. brucei rhodesienses and KB cells Compound 3 was assayed again and showed IC50 of 23.6 M against P. falciparum and IC50 of 15.6 M against T. brucei rhodesienses. An assay with KB cells has been also devel- oped in order to compare in vitro toxicity of dihydrocinnamic V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 4281 acid with the selective action on the parasites, and 3 was not toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 M). The 2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acids represent a novel class of compounds tested for the ﬁrst time as antimalarial and try- panocidal agents. Unfortunately, the other compounds showed no appreciable activity against P. falciparum and T. brucei rhode- sienses (IC50 > 100 M). Activity appears to be associated with a methyl ester function, since E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy- 4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid 5 and 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid 4 were inactive against both protozoan. Thus, in order to ﬁnd potential lead com- pounds, derivatives 4 and 5 will be converted in methyl ester and assayed again. 4. Conclusion Compounds 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6- propanoic acid (4), E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbomet hoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3) were obtained in one-step HSCCC separation. The one-step separation was more rapid (1 h and 20 min) and less solvents consuming, while conven- tional methods of CC for separation of guyanin (1), rutaecarpin (2) and dictamnine (6) from HSCCC fraction 4, 6 and 7–8 (respectively) were rather time consuming. Fraction 4 was ﬂash chromatographed on silica gel and compound 1 was obtained with more work- ing time (12 h). Fractions 6 and 7–8 were applied to Sephadex LH-20 ant took less working time (4 h). The present LC–APCI- MS/MS method was successfully applied to the quantiﬁcation of all six compounds from the crude extracts, and permit- ted to determine the recovery of compounds 1–6 in HSCCC analyses, which were excellent. The present study proved that HSCCC is a powerful technique for the isolation in one-step of compounds 3–5 from plant crude extracts for bioactivity stud- ies. The biological result indicated that the compound tested was active at concentrations in the micromolar range, while the con- trols chloroquine (IC50 3.0 nM, P. falciparum) and pentamidine (IC50 35 nM, T. brucei) were active in the nanomolar range under the same test conditions. However, if it is assumed that the IC50 required for continued investigation is <30 M, the IC50 of compound 3 is meaningful. Chemical transformation of the limonoid guyanin (1, 40 mg) and alkaloid rutaecarpin (2, 110 mg) is in progress and perhaps could improve their antibacterial activity against X. fastidiosa.

The gingerols puriﬁcation was carried out in HPLC system using a Luna-C18 and the best mobile phase evaluated was MeOH/H2O (75:25, v/v). This new methodology for the gingerols isolation was very effective, since considerable amounts (in the range of milligrams) with a good purity degree (∼98%) were achieved in 30 min of chromatographic run. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol puriﬁed by this methodology inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 ± 134.6 M, 135.6 ± 22.6 M and 12.1 ± 0.3 M, respectively. These substances also inhibited human ﬁbroblasts (HF) cell proliferation, however in concentrations starting from 500 M. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an optimization of gingerols isolation and their speciﬁc anti-proliferative activities against tumor cells, suggesting their use as important models for drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Several population-based studies indicate that people in Asian countries have a much lower risk of different cancer types such as colon, gastrointestinal, prostate and breast, when compared to their Western counterparts. It is widely claimed that constituents of their diet such as ginger, garlic, soy, curcumin, onion, tomatoes, cru- ciferous vegetables, chillies, and green tea contribute to that lower incidence [1]. Therefore, there is increasing interest in naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive agents. Ginger (Zingiber ofﬁcinale Roscoe) is widely used worldwide as a food, spice and herb [2]. Together with [6]-gingerol, [8]- and [10]- gingerol are the major pungent constituents in the ginger oleoresin ∗Corresponding author.

Gin- gerols comprise a series of homologue substances differentiated by the length of their alkyl chains with [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol having 10, 12 and 14 carbons in their unbranched alkyl chains, respectively [3]. Regarding [6]-gingerol a variety of pharmacological charac- teristics was already described, including analgesic, antipyretic, cardiotonic, hypothermia inducing and cancer preventing effects [4–6]. However, the effects on tumor cell proliferation for [8]- and [10]-gingerol are still scarce. Breast cancer is the third most frequent cancer in the world and one of the most common malignant diseases in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the second highest cause of death in women after cervical cancer [7]. To treat breast and many other cancer types, chemotherapy is one of the most extensively studied methods. However, its efﬁcacy and safety remain a primary con- cern as well as its toxicity and other side effects [8,9]. Another reason for concern regarding this method is the development of chemotherapy resistance, which is a major obstacle to the effec- tive treatment of many tumor types, including breast cancer [8]. Tumor cells are found to adopt multiple mechanisms to resist drugs, such as decreased uptake, and/or enhanced efﬂux and altered drug 1570-0232/$ – see front matter © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Alteration in drug targets, activation of detoxiﬁcation systems, enhanced DNA repair ability, and inhibition of apoptosis are also cancer cell strategies to resist against chemotherapy drugs [10]. Many anticancer therapies can temporarily stop tumor growth; it means that, in most cases, the effect is not permanent. In this way, there is a signiﬁcant need for new agents with low susceptibility to common drug resistance mechanisms in order to improve response rates and potentially prolong patient’s survival. Approximately 30% of the women diagnosed with early-stage disease progress to metastatic breast cancer. To these women, therapeutic options are still limited. Current recommendations for ﬁrst-line chemotherapy include anthracycline-based and taxanes treatments (paclitaxel and docetaxel) [8]. Taxanes – which are taxol derivatives that were ﬁrst described as microtubule stabilizing agents [11] and then had their antineoplasic effects conﬁrmed [12,13] – are the ﬁrst example of natural product derivatives used in antitumor therapy. Therefore, the search for new natural products that may be used as an addi- tional alternative to the chemotherapy in an attempt to develop more effective drugs with fewer side effects is of great interest [14]. Based on this assumption it is important to develop an effective method for the isolation of these compounds. The aim of this work was to search a faster, efﬁcient and pro- ductive procedure for isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol by reverse phase HPLC operating under overloading conditions and to test their anti-proliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumor line and normal human ﬁbroblasts (HF), a non tumor cell line. The results presented in this study showed a more speciﬁc anti-proliferative activity for [8]- and [10]-gingerol against breast cancer compared to HF and suggest their use as important models for anti-cancer therapy in an attempt to develop new drugs with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol were isolated from the ethanol extract of the ginger rhizome (purchased locally) by liquid chro- matography. The structures were elucidated by 1H NMR using a Bruker DRX200 instrument (Bruker, USA), operating at 200 MHz for 1H spectra, with TMS as internal standard, GC–MS on a Shimadzu QP 5000 and comparison with literature data. The purity was deter- mined by elemental analysis on an EA 1108, CHNS-O (Fisons). HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from JTBaker Company (Netherland). Water was deionised. All other analytical grade reagents were from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation The fresh ginger rhizome was thin sliced, dried at 40 ◦C and ground to powder. The powder was extracted with ethanol for 72 h, three times. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 ◦C. The extraction of ginger (0.4 kg dry weight) yielded 21.2 g of crude extract (5.3%). The extract was stored at −4 ◦C for the later fractionation. In order to isolate [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, dry ginger rhizome crude ethanol extract was chromatographed on SiO2 (70–230 mesh) column with bed height 20 cm (20 cm × 8 cm i.d.), using initially n-hexane (1 L), to eliminate the lipids. After, n- hexane/ethyl acetate 50:50 (v/v, 2.5 L) was used as eluent resulting in 5 fractions (A1-5), where the fractions A1, A2, A3 and A4 (68.9%, 14.6 g), rich in [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerols, were joined resulting in the fraction A1–4. Part of this fraction (5.5 g) was re-chromatographed on SiO2 column (28 cm × 5 cm i.d.) using n-hexane/ethyl acetate 60:40 (v/v, 2.4 L). Forty eight fractions (50 mL each) were collected and combined after monitoring by TLC resulting in six sub-fractions with the following volumes: 250 mL (B1), 400 mL (B2), 150 mL (B3), 800 mL (B4), 200 mL (B5) and 600 mL (B6). The gingerols were the main constituent on the fraction B4 (800 mL, 2.8 g, yellow oil). Analytical and semi-preparative HPLC were carried out using a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP system with an SPD-10AVP UV–vis detec- tor with a ﬂow cell analytical or ﬂow cell preparative, according with the HPLC mode (analytical or semi-preparative), and a Shi- madzu LC-6AD pump. The isolation optimization was carried out on a Luna-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m, homemade, UFSCar, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) and the column was maintained at 25 ◦C, the detection wavelength was set at 282 nm and the ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phases consisted of isocratic binary mixtures (v/v) of MeOH/H2O (80:20; 75:25; 70:30) and ACN/H2O (67:33). Forty microlitres of methanol containing 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of B4 sample were injected. In the col- umn scale-up reverse phase semi-preparative, a Luna-C18 column (300 mm × 10 mm i.d., 10 m, homemade, UFSCar, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) was used. This column was maintained at 25 ◦C, the detec- tion wavelength was set at 254 nm (lower absorbance wavelength for the gingerols) and the ﬂow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The best mobile phase was MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v) and the scale-up factor was calculated using Eq. (1) below, where S, R, L, P, A are scale-up factor, column radius, column length, semi-preparative and ana- lytical columns, respectively. The maximum amount of fraction B4 injected in the semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg diluted to ﬁnal volume of 400 L. S = R2 PxLP R2 AxLA (1) 2.3. Cell line and culture MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor and HF cell lines, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), were maintained at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Cultilab – Campinas; SP, Brazil) containing 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum), penicillin (100 UI/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and l-glutamine (2 mM). Cell cultures and experiments were conducted in a humid- iﬁed environment with 5% CO2 at 37 ◦C. 2.4. Proliferation assays Cell lines were prepared at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/200 L, in appropriate medium with 10% of FBS, and plated on sterile 96-well plates for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14–18 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, known as starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation, the culture medium was removed from the wells and a new one, supplemented with 10% of FBS, containing different concentrations of the tested compounds was added to the wells. The cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h under the same conditions as described above. Cell proliferation assay was performed in comparison to the wells where the vehicle compound (2.5% DMSO) was added instead of the tested compounds. After incubation, the culture medium of each well was removed and a solution containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added (100 L/well). The plates were then kept at 37 ◦C for 4 h and the formed crystals were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. The absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 595 nm. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control for inhibition of cell proliferation [15]. J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 159 Fig. 1. Chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]-gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 80:20; MeOH/H2O 75:25, ACN/H2O 67:23 and MeOH/H2O 70:30, UV detection at 282 nm and ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 40 L. 2.5. Statistical analysis Each experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and a standard error mean was calculated. Shapiro–Wilk’s W test was used to verify data normality. As normal distribution was present, the results were compared statistically with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Since the ANOVA tests showed signiﬁcant differences (acceptable P level < 0.05), Bonferroni’s signiﬁcant dif- ference post hoc analyses were performed to determine differences between simple and grouped main-effect means, respectively. The data were analyzed by using Statistica software (version 8.0; Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, USA) and IC50 calculations were made using Hill’s equation in the Origin software (version 8.5; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). 3. Results 3.1. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation Four different conditions were carried out on analytical C18 column HPLC to achieve the best separation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol. The best separation condition was achieved using MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v), where a good separation of three gingerols in a single run of 30 min was obtained (Fig. 1). The injection volume (400 L) was larger than the usual size of an injection volume and also it was not the one that was calcu- lated by the scale up formula. This occurred because of the sample viscosity, which would be very high if 170.1 mg were diluted in 230 L (calculated volume) that would impair the chromatographic separation. For column overloading with the sample, increasing amounts of fraction B4 (0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg diluted to ﬁnal volume 40 L) were injected in a C18 analytical column. Using the detector at 282 nm electronic saturation was observed when 5 mg of sample was injected, although the peaks were still visible for isolation of gingerols until 15 mg. With the injection of 30 mg of sample, the electronic saturation hindered the visualization of peaks closer to peak 1 (Fig. 2). To solve this prob- lem, on the semi-preparative mode, the detector was set at 254 nm and in this condition it was possible to identify the three gingerols present in the fraction. Fig. 2. Overload chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]- gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 75:25, UV detection at 282 nm and ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injected masses were 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. The injection volume was 40 L. Using Eq. (1) for the determination of scale-up factor, the value 5.67 was obtained, consequently the maximum amount of B4 frac- tion that could be injected in a semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg (Fig. 3). However, to make the adjustment of the ﬂow rate easier we decided to use 6.0 mL/min instead of 5.67 mL/min, and by working in this condition the results obtained were satisfactory. The mass of each gingerol obtained from 170.1 mg of fraction B4 was: 94 mg ([6]-gingerol), 22 mg ([8]-gingerol) and 17 mg ([10]- gingerol). The purity of gingerols was calculated based on the elemental analysis of each gingerol. The puriﬁcation yields based on the fresh ginger weight were 1027, 241 and 187 ppm for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. The purity obtained was 94.4, 99 and 97.3% for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. Fig. 3.

The injected masses were 85.1 mg, 170.1 mg. The injection volume was 400 L. 160 J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 Fig. 4. Effects of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 and Human Fibroblasts cell proliferation. MDA-MB-231 tumor cells or Human Fibroblasts were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/200 L in a 96-well plate containing DMEM medium with 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum) for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14–18 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, named starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation the monolayers were incubated with different concentrations of [6]-, [8]- or [10]-gingerol in DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% of FBS. The cells were incubated for 24 (A) or 48 (B) hours. Viable cells were estimated by the MTT assay. Results are mean ± SD of three independent assays in triplicate (a = [6]-gingerol vs. [8]-gingerol P < 0.05; b = [6]-gingerol vs. [10]-gingerol P < 0.01; c = [8]-gingerol vs. [10]-gingerol P < 0.001). 3.2.

Effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol on normal and tumor cell proliferation The effects of isolated compounds, [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-gingerol, were compared to their effects on HF, a normal (non tumor) cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). In these assays, the controls were made by incubating the cells in a normal medium, supplemented with 10% of FBS (+FBS), in a medium without FBS (−FBS), adding DMSO (ﬁnal concentration of 2.5%) to the medium supplemented with 10% of FBS (DMSO) and ﬁnally, in doxorubicin (1.5 M), a compound used in breast cancer chemotherapy, as a positive control for cell proliferation inhibition [15]. The results showed that [8]-gingerol affects MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation after 24 h of incubation, with 500 and 1000 M inhibiting approximately 75% and 50% of tumor cell prolifera- tion, respectively (Fig. 4A and B). After 48 h of incubation with [8]-gingerol 100 M there was approximately 60% of MDA-MB- 231 cell proliferation inhibition (Fig. 4B). At the same incubation period with [8]-gingerol 500 and 1000 M, MDA-MB-231 inhibi- tion remained in a rate of 75% compared to control cells (+FBS). [8]-Gingerol 1, 10 and 50 M had no effects on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation (Fig. 4A and B). Fig. 5. Differential effects of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 M on MDA-MB- 231 and Human Fibroblasts cell proliferation after 48 h of incubation. Results are mean ± SD of three independent assays in triplicate (a = MDA-MB-231 vs. HF P < 0.01; b = MDA-MB-231 vs. HF P < 0.001). J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 161 For [10]-gingerol, a concentration of 100 M was signiﬁcantly effective in inhibiting MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at 24 h of incubation in a rate of 75%, compared to cells seeded on normal medium (+FBS). The same pattern was observed after 48 h of [10]- gingerol incubation; there was a cell proliferation inhibition of about 90% (Fig. 4B). HF were used in order to compare the effects of both [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in a non tumor cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). No signiﬁcant differences in MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation using 1, 10, 50 and 100 M for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in 24 or 48 h of incubation were veriﬁed. However, 500 and 1000 M concentra- tions were effective in this inhibition, but in an approximate rate of only 50% (Fig. 4A and B). The differential effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 M after 48 h of incubation with HF and MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line are demonstrated in Fig. 5. These compounds were more effective in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (MDA-MB-231) when compared to normal cell proliferation (HF). The IC50 values for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation were calculated. The results showed that these compounds inhibited the prolifera- tion of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 ± 134.6 M; 135.6 ± 22.6 M and 12.1 ± 0.3 M, respectively. These substances also inhibit HF cell proliferation, nevertheless, we were not able to calculate the IC50 values for this cell line, since the initial concen- tration that had an effect was 500 M for [6]-, [8] and [10]-gingerol. 4. Discussion Studies of isolation and puriﬁcation of gingerols are scarce in the literature. Considering the interesting biological activities and the potential of these compounds to the medical area it is imperative to develop new methodologies to achieve an optimization of gin- gerol separation and puriﬁcation. The isolation of gingerols ([6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol) described in this work was achieved satis- factorily, once it was possible to obtain relatively high mass and a good degree of gingerols purity. To our knowledge, only one work about isolation of gingerols using HPLC system was published [18]. In this work, the authors isolated the major gingerols from the crude dichloromethane extract of ginger rhizome by normal phase HPLC. A low purity degree (calculated by the percentage of peak area) for both, [8]-gingerol (86%) and [10]-gingerol (84%) was achieved, while for the [6]-gingerol the purity was 99%. The purity degree obtained for each gingerol does not represent the real one, because HPLC system using UV detection does not guarantee the absence of other components in the sample. In a recent work, the isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol was carried out using counter-current chromatography (CCC). In this study gingerols were obtained with high purity degree (99%), however the time of chromatographic run was very length (240 min) [19]. In another work regarding iso- lation of gingerols from crude extract of ginger rhizome using CCC the time of chromatographic run was again very extensive, and the purity was about 98% [20]. Electronic saturation is a factor that considerable limits the increasing of injected mass in the semi-preparative scale. In our work, this factor had limited injections of samples with higher masses, even at a wavelength of low absorption of gingerols (254 nm) (Fig. 3). However, the gingerols were isolated in sig- niﬁcant quantities and with a good purity degree. To avoid the electronic saturation we could use either a less sensitive ﬂow cell or make the adjustment of the wavelength well off the lambda max. We have not tried a less sensitive cell, however all the experiment conditions were tested in the lower absorption wavelength for the gingerols, and we still obtained electronic saturation. It may be possible to use other detectors even though we have only used UV. The effects of [6]-gingerol on tumor cell proliferation are already well documented [5,21–23], however, the effects of [8]- and [10]- gingerol on tumor cells are still scarce. In fact, among all the ginger constituents, much more attention has been given to [6]-gingerol in order to explore its pharmacological properties and action mech- anisms. In this sense, besides [6]-gingerol effects, those of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on in vitro tumor cell proliferation using MDA-MB- 231 and HF cell lines were also investigated. The overall results suggest that the higher the alkyl chain, the greater the effectiveness of gingerol in inhibiting tumor cell pro- liferation, probably due to the manner in which these substances enter the cells through their plasma membrane. In general, with increasing alkyl chain lengths, there is an increase in lipophilic character (log P) of compounds, and this can be quantiﬁed by the partition coefﬁcient (P) in an n-octanol/water system. It is also known that the higher the log P value, to a certain extent, the higher will be the permeation in biological membranes [24,25]. This can be extended to compounds such as gingerols, which represent a homologous series of substances. Similar effects of gingerols and other ginger-derived substances were already described in the literature. Tjendraputra et al. [26] demonstrated that the inhibition of COX-2 by ginger constituents and synthetic analogs was structure-dependent. The lipophilicity and the functional group substitution on the alkyl side chain, as well as the aromatic moiety were the main aspects inﬂuencing COX-2 inhibition. Similar correlations between the side-chain length of gingerols and their activities of apoptosis induction and neuronal cells protection from -amyloid insult have already been demon- strated [27,28]. The cytotoxic effect of [8]- and [10]-gingerol has been investi- gated by a few authors [27,29]. Kim and coworkers [29] have tested the effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol in a variety of human tumor cells lines including A-549 (lung cancer), SK-OV-3 (ovarian cancer), SK- MEL-2 (skin cancer) and HCT15 (colon cancer). They found an IC50 ranging from approximately 4.52 g/mL (13 M) to 12.57 g/mL (40 M), with [10]-gingerol being more effective than [8]-gingerol in decreasing the viability of these tumor cell lines [29]. Wei and coworkers [27] found an IC50 of 87.9 ± 3.5 M and 56.5 ± 6.0 M for [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively, in the inhibition of HL-60 proliferation, a human leukemia tumor cell line. These data are in accordance with the ﬁndings in this work on MDA-MB-231 cells, revealing the same activity dependence on the chain length size pattern. Kuo and collaborators [30] working with SW480 cells, a lin- eage of colorectal cancer, observed that [10]-gingerol caused a signiﬁcant concentration-dependent and sustained [Ca2+]i rise, suggesting that this elevation can alter cellular functions, leading to cell death. They found a cytotoxic effect of [10]-gingerol 50, 75 and 100 M [30]. It is important to notice that the methodology in the present study was different, even though, similar effects were found in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line. Our ﬁndings demonstrate a speciﬁcity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on the inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation when com- pared to non tumor human ﬁbroblast cell line. The ﬁndings of other authors corroborate with our results. Kazi et al. [31] described the effects of antibiotics derived from -lactam, lactam 1 and 12 on normal and tumor cells. They show that lactam 1 selectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat T, but not in the non transformed, immortalized human natural killer cells. Further- more, the authors demonstrated that lactam 12 induces apoptosis selectively in Jurkat T and simian virus 40-transformed, but not in non transformed NK and parental normal ﬁbroblast cells. The authors propose that these N-thiolated -lactams act by inducing DNA damage that leads to apoptosis preferentially in cancer and transformed over normal/non transformed cells. Another exam- ple includes pancratistatin, a natural compound isolated from the 162 J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 spider lily, which is an efﬁcient inducer of apoptosis in human lymphoma (Jurkat) cells, with minimal effect on normal nucleated blood cells. The authors discuss that this selective effect could be due to the expression of the Fas receptors, which are found to be greater in blood lymphoma cells than normal blood cells. Further- more, in fast-dividing cancer cells, the plasma membrane tends to run short of lipids, perhaps changing the ﬂuidity of the membrane [32]. Ovadje et al. [33] demonstrate that dandelion root extract is capable of inducing apoptosis at low concentrations speciﬁcally in cancer cells with no toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, Mathen et al. [34] working with extracts from Calotropis gigantea, the giant milkweed, traditionally used for the treatment of cancer and in Ayurvedic medicine and Poecilocerus pic- tus, an orthopteran insect, which feeds on C. gigantea, demonstrated that both the insect and the plant extracts induce concentration- dependent apoptosis and differentiate between human cancer cells and normal cells and exhibit species speciﬁcity. The chemopreventive mechanisms of gingerols are not well understood however, are thought to involve proapoptotic [27,35–37], antioxidant [38], anti-inﬂammatory [6,39–41], and anti-angiogenic [42] activities. Further investigation will be done in order to determine the mechanisms by which [8]- and [10]- gingerol act inhibiting with more speciﬁcity the MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, this work presents a new methodology for the isolation of gingerols, which proved to be effective, once consid- erable amounts with a good purity degree in a relatively short time of chromatographic run were achieved from these important bioactive compounds, mainly [8]-gingerol (99%) and [10]-gingerol (97.3%). This is the ﬁrst report on the separation of these com- pounds with such a purity degree using HPLC semi-preparative scale. Optimizations in the separation process regarding column overloading can still be made so that the electron saturation be not reached, which can be achieved by using other less sensitive detec- tors. The gingerols isolated through this methodology, demonstrate an anti-proliferative activity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol speciﬁcally on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells when compared to HF normal cells. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst report regarding a speciﬁc cell effect of ginger derivatives. The results also suggest the use of [8]- and [10]-gingerol as important models for anti-cancer therapy and drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.

(Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a familiar Brazilian species popularly known as Tarum˜a whose leaf tea has been used by population to treat kidney diseases. The aim of this research was to investigate the hydroalcoholic extract of leaves in order to isolate the active compounds. Hydroalcoholic extract of leaves was obtained by stirring the previous hexane and methanol extracted leaves residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing. The obtained extract was partitioned with n-butanol. The yielded fraction was subsequently submitted to several chromatographic procedures to lead to the isolation of O-glycosidicﬂavones orientin and isoorientin as well as C-glycosylﬂavones schaftoside and carlinoside along with their isomers, known as potent anti-inﬂammatory, antinociceptive and antioxidant agents, then identiﬁed as the active constituents, justifying the folk use of the plant to combat and prevent kidney stone and inﬂammation. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

(Lamiaceae, according to Cantino et al., 1992; formerly Verbenaceae, in keeping with Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the States of Minas Gerais, Esp´ırito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and S˜ao Paulo (Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957). The plant was col- lected in July 2000, in the city of Poc¸os de Caldas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and authenticated by Dr. F´atima Regina Salimena-Pires, a taxonomic botanist from Universi- dade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Faculdade de Filosoﬁa, Ciˆencias e Letras da Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, campus Ribeir˜ao Preto (SPFR), Brazil, under the acquisition number 9968. ∗Corresponding author.

Use in traditional medicine The leaf tea is used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat and prevent kidney stone and inﬂammation (Rodrigues, 2001). 3. Previously isolated classes of constituents In preceding studies, Vitex polygama has been found to contain sesquiterpenes, fatty acids (Barbosa et al., 1995), 2′′-O- caffeoylorientin besides other common ﬂavones simultaneously with some O-glycosylated derivatives, ﬂavonols, phenolic acids (Leit˜ao and Delle Monache, 1998), several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the essential oil (Leit˜ao et al., 1999), phy- tosteroids, caffeoylesters from quinic acid (Santos, 2000), and ecdysteroids (Santos et al., 2001). 4. Materials and methods The powder of the air-dried leaves (423.0 g) was extracted successively with hexane and methanol (MeOH) through per- colation process at room temperature. Hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing for 10 min (3× 300 mL). 0378-8741/$ – see front matter © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Chemical structures of compounds isolated from Vitex polygama n-butanolic extract. The resulting ﬁltrates were subsequently combined, evaporated in vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized. Afterward, the extract (31 g, 31%, w/w of the dry leaves weight (DLW)) was dissolved in distilled water and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using ethyl acetate (EA) and n-BuOH (BU) (5× 300 mL each) to yield EA (2.2 g, 2.2%, w/w DLW) and BU (10.7 g, 10.7%, w/w DLW) fractions, respectively. BU fraction was subjected to CC using XAD7 (46.0 cm × 4.0 cm) and subsequent elution with 500 mL of water (WV), water/MeOH 1:1 (WMV) and 2 L of MeOH (MV). One gram of the dried fraction MV (6.75 g, 6.75%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (53.0 cm × 3.0 cm) using MeOH as eluent resulting in 41 frac- tions of 30 mL, which were pooled into seven fractions (MV1 to MV7). Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg, 1.13%, w/w DLW) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with MeOH. Twenty-three fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven (MV4s to MV4z). Frac- tion 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg, 0.39% w/w DLW) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase MeOH, ﬂow-rate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield com- pounds 1 and 2 (5.5 mg, 0.04%, w/w DLW), substances 3 and 4 (3.1 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) after three cycles of 54 min. Frac- tion 5 (MV5, 293.1 mg, 1.98%, w/w DLW) was submitted to the same R-HPLC system to yield compounds 5 and 6 (20.5 mg, 0.14%, w/w DLW) as mixture, and compounds 7 and 8 (3.0 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) also as mixture. Fraction WV, after recrys- tallization in 90% aqueous MeOH solution, afforded substance 9 (280.0 mg). 5. Results From n-BuOH partition of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves from Vitex polygama were isolated the compounds caffeoyl 6- O--d-glucopyranoside (1), caffeoyl 6-O--d-glucopyranoside (2), schaftoside (3), isoschaftoside (4), orientin (5), isoorientin (6), carlinoside (7), isocarlinoside (8) and metacrylic acid (9) whose chemical structures (Fig. 1) were identiﬁed by means of 1H and 13C NMR as well as HMBC, HSQC and negative ESI/MS spectra data which were in accordance with previously reported data (Kitagawa, 1984; Besson et al., 1985; Dayrit et al., 1987; Shimomura et al., 1988). Schaftoside and its isomer is known for its efﬁcacy as anti-inﬂammatory (Melo et al., 2005) and preventive effect against kidney stone in rats, as evaluated by urine output, excretion of Ca, citric acid, and creatinine analysis (Kubo et al., 1989). Moreover the C-glycosidic ﬂavones 3, 4, 7 and 8 are being reported for the ﬁrst time in the genus Vitex.

According to their voltammetric behavior, the antioxidant activity of these phenolic acids was evaluated and the results pointed to the following sequence: caffeic acid (Ea ¼ þ0:31 V)>chlorogenic acid (+0.38 V)>sinapic acid (+0.45 V)>ferulic acid (+0.53 V)>p-coumaric acid (+0.73 V). The results were conﬁrmed by DPPH test, which evidenced the strongest antiradical activity for compounds possessing the cathecol moiety (caffeic and chlorogenic acids). Linear calibration graphs were obtained for their determination at concentrations from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1. The method was applied to orange juice. Selectivity was illustrated by the analysis of caffeic and chlorogenic acids electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode previously modiﬁed by electrochemical activation in the presence of ascorbic acid. r 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Dietary recommendations for healthy eating include the consumption of fruit juices (Williams, 1995) whose beneﬁcial health effects are mostly ascribed to natural antioxidants. Although the majority of the evidence emphasizes the roles of vitamin E, vitamin C and b-carotene, recent studies have highlighted the importance of the phenolic antioxidants in the total antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jfca.2003.09.013 Citrus phenolics represent a varied and widely studied class of compounds (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The phenolic substances of importance in orange can be classiﬁed into two groups: phenolic acids and related compounds and ﬂavonoids. The most important phenolic acid in orange juice is cinnamic acid and its derivatives: ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The relative contribution of phenolic derivatives to the antioxidant potential is associated with their effectiveness as hydrogen donors, which is dependent on the number and arrangement of the hydroxyl groups and the extent of structural conjugation, as well as the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring (Rice-Evans et al., 2000; Miller et al., 1993; Clegg and Morton, 1968). The antiradical ability of organic compounds may be assessed by measuring the ease of their reaction with the stable free radical diphenylpycrylhydrazyl (DPPH lmax 517 nm), leading to its reduced form (DPPH-H). Good free radical scavengers react fast leaving small amounts of unreduced DPPH, which indicates the presence of an effective antioxidant (Bonded et al., 1997). In addition to their antioxidant capacity, fruit phenolics have been the subject of increased interest in the last few years because their presence can contribute to the sensory quality of the fruit and juice through their effect on color, bitterness, astringency and ﬂavor. Therefore, different analytical methods are required for their quantiﬁcation (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Cordella et al., 2002). Phenolic substances have characteristic ultraviolet spectra, which have been used to detect adulteration in orange juice by spectrophotometric techniques (Escarpa and Gonz!alez, 2001; Frenzel and Krekler, 1995). These procedures have been replaced by chromatographic procedures, which provide more detailed information on samples containing several organic compounds (Escarpa and Gonz!alez, 2001; Bocchi et al., 1996). For example, analytical procedures for ferulic acid have been based on gas chromatography with ﬂame ionization or electron-capture detection following derivatization. HPLC methods for these phenolic compounds in orange juice have been used involving derivatization and/or solid-phase extraction coupled with UV, photodiode-array and ﬂuorescence detection (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Bocchi et al., 1996; Moskvin et al., 1999; Karovicov!a and Simko, 2000; Miller and Rice-Evans 1997; Christofersen and Cardwell, 1996). Alternatively, serial coulometric detection of phenolic compounds has been used to generate multivariate data for differentiation of juices (Peyrat- Maillard et al., 2000). The use of cyclic voltammetry as an instrumental tool for the evaluation of the total antioxidant capacity of the low-molecular-weight antioxidants (LMWAs) in both ﬂuids (Chevion et al., 2000) and edible plants (Chevion et al., 1999) is well known. A cyclic voltammogram provides information describing the integrated antioxidant capacity, which arises in large part from the ability of the compound to donate electrons around the potential of the anodic wave. Most of the LMWAs are reducing agents, which quench reactive oxygen species through electron donation (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1985). Therefore, evaluation of the overall reducing power by cyclic voltammetry reﬂects the antioxidant activity of pure compounds as well as that of mixture of compounds. Most of the studies involving LMWA reports ascorbic acid as a major component in the cyclic voltammetry response identiﬁed by measure of anodic peak around +0.4 V vs. Ag/ AgCl/Cl (Yu et al., 1996). Glassy carbon is the electrode material used extensively in electrochemistry for analysis of electroactive substances and as the basis for surface-modiﬁed electrodes. The electrochemical properties of this material can be improved by surface treatment (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 620 Electrochemical activation of the glassy carbon electrode through oxidation and reduction of the electrode surface is a widely used method to change its characteristics. Many authors (Zhang et al., 1996; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Golabi and Zare, 1999; Moreno et al., 2000) have demonstrated that this procedure can improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the electroanalytical method application. For instance, the electrode can present a good performance for catalysis and/or applications as electrochemical detectors for signiﬁcant types of analytes due to selective chemical or physical interaction between speciﬁc functional groups generated on its surface and selective species in solution. In spite of the high sensitivity and selectivity of electroanalytical methods and the great importance of phenolic acids in orange juice, few studies have been conducted on the application of this technique for their determination. So, the aim of the present work was to investigate the electrochemical behavior of cinnamic acid and its derivatives (Fig. 1) on glassy carbon electrode. In addition, the possibility of using electroactivated glassy carbon electrode for oxidation of ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was studied for their selective determination in orange juice without interference of ascorbic acid. In order to conﬁrm the effectiveness of these phenolic acids as free radical scavengers and to correlate this activity with the electrochemical behavior, a spectrophotometric test using DPPH as a substrate was also undertaken. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Apparatus and procedures The electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Metrohm Polarecord E 506 linked to a compatible microcomputer through a Microquimica interface.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 621 Metrohm stand 663 VA was used and a glassy carbon disc (0.02 cm2) from Metrohm was used as the working electrode. A carbon auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl/Cl (3.0 mol L1) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrode modiﬁcation was based on the following procedure described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999). The glassy carbon electrode surface was polished with 0.05 mm alumina suspension and rinsed with water. The electrode was immersed in 0.1 mol L1 sodium bicarbonate and submitted to continuous potential cycling from 1.3 to +1.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s1 for 5 min. The activated electrodes were rinsed and placed in a solution containing 1 103 mol L1 of the phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6. The deposition was carried out by dipping and by cycling the potential from 0.1 to +0.8 V at 50 mV s1 during a controlled time of 5 min. After both these processes, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with water and immersed in a solution containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The modiﬁed electrode exhibited a well-shaped cyclic voltammogram corresponding to the reversible oxidation of surface deposited only for caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid and stable current values were obtained only for the cycling method used for the deposition of diphenol compounds. Suprapur grade reagents supplied by Merck and demineralized water from a Milli-Q system (Milli-pore) were used in the preparation of all solutions. Acetate buffer used as a supporting electrolyte was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0.2 mol L1 acetic acid and sodium acetate solution. Ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic, chlorogenic and ascorbic acid stock solutions (1 102 mol L1) were prepared from the dry pure substances in water. An aliquot of the standard solution to be investigated was added by micropipette to 20 mL of deaerated acetate buffer pH 5.6, unless stated otherwise. Analyses of caffeic acid and chlorogenic compounds in orange juice were carried out using three representative samples of natural juice commercialized in Brazil as Danones, Jussys and Batavos. For comparison reasons, all samples examined were recently produced and stored at 10C in obscurity and analyzed shortly after opening. An aliquot of 600 mL of the orange juice (without any previous dilution or extraction) was transferred directly into the voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The previous activated electrode was immersed in this solution and seven uninterrupted voltammetric curves were recorded between +0.1 and +0.8 V at 50 mV s1 when stable curves were obtained. Finally, the cyclic voltammograms were carried out after a step where the electrode was rinsed and placed in a voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The mean values of peak currents were obtained and the acids composi- tion determined after standard addition method, when 1 103 mol L1 of caffeic acid solution was added to the original sample and submitted to the deposition step, after which the voltammograms were recorded as shown above. All measurements were analyzed in triplicates. 2.2. Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) The free radical scavenging capacity of ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was also estimated from its ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 106 to 1 104 mol L1 were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 622 phenolic acid to reduce the absorbance of DPPH solution at 517 nm, followed on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at a glassy carbon electrode Cinnamic acid and its derivatives, ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic, contain reducible oleﬁnic bond or oxidizible phenolic substituents on the aromatic ring that could provide the basis for their voltammetric determination. Nevertheless, only differential pulse voltammo- grams of 1 103 mol L1 of cinnamic acid exhibit one cathodic peak in the pH range 3–7 at very negative potential (1.5 V). The process is attributed to the reduction of the pre-protonated ethylene bond conjugated (H+[C6H5–CHQCH–COOH) after two-electron transfer, as veriﬁed previously by polarographic studies (Ferreira et al., 1996). The inductive effects from ortho and/or para hydroxyl groups to the double bond, which is conjugated with the aromatic ring in the derivatives ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, make the molecule more difﬁcult to reduce. Therefore, the cyclic voltammograms do not exhibit any voltammetric waves for reduction of phenolic derivatives on the useful potential range, and the methods do not demonstrate any analytical potentiality for their determination using the reduction of the oleﬁnic bond in these compounds. On the other hand, typical cyclic voltammograms obtained for all phenolic derivatives are shown in Fig. 2. Except cinnamic acid, which is not oxidized, all the derivatives present well- deﬁned waves, and the shape and the peak potentials are characteristic of each compound. The anodic oxidation of 1.0 103 mol L1 caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have shown only one anodic peak at Epa ¼ þ0:36 V and Epa ¼ þ0:38 V, respectively. Linear plots of peak current (ipa) as a function of n1=2 were obtained indicating that both oxidation processes are diffusion controlled (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). For both compounds, a cathodic peak is observed on the reverse scan. Epc–Epa values obtained from the cyclic voltammograms (n ¼ 20 mV s1) are around 30 mV suggesting a process involving two electrons (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The ratio of the anodic-to-cathodic peak heights (ipc=ipa) increases gradually from 0.8 to 1 with increasing potential sweep rate from 10 to 100 mV s1 and the calculated current functions (ipa n1=2) diminish gradually with the potential scan rate, showing the classical behavior of an oxidation process coupled with a slow subsequent chemical reaction. In order to establish their analytical potentiality, quantitative tests were developed for caffeic and chlorogenic acids using their anodic peaks by linear voltammetric scan. At pH 5.6, the analytical curves are linear from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1 and are described by the following regression lines: ip (mA)=0.08138+2.1472 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.9993, n ¼ 7) for caffeic acid and: ip (mA)=0.05321+1.9571 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.995, n ¼ 6 for chlorogenic acid. The reproducibility of the response was tested using a series of standard solutions of 5 104 mol L1 caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Relative standard deviations of 2.4% and 2.8% were obtained, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1.0 103 mol L1 sinapic, ferulic and coumaric acids in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have also shown one anodic peak at Epa ¼ þ0:45 V, Epa ¼ þ0:53 V and ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 623 Epa ¼ þ0:73 V, respectively. The inﬂuence of scan rate on the cyclic voltammetric parameters was investigated from 0.01 to 3 V s1. The anodic peak appears to correspond to an irreversible process, as no current is observed in the reverse scan. The peak current is proportional to n1=2; indicating that the process is diffusion controlled. The current function decreased markedly up to a highest scan rate. These results suggest that the oxidation step is followed by an electron transfer coupled with a rapid chemical reaction (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). A linear relationship between peak current and sinapic acid and ferulic acid concentrations was obtained from 4 104 to 1 103 mol L1 following the equation: ip (mA)=0.1302+ 0.602 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.9089, n ¼ 7 for sinapic acid and ip ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA E / mV 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 E / mV E / mV E / mV E (V) E / mV -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0 5 10 15 20 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Fig. 2.

A linear relationship was also obtained for coumaric acid from 4 105 to 1.2 103 mol L1: ip (mA)=0.05705+1.0663 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.995, n ¼ 7: In agreement with the literature (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Baizer and Lund, 1972), the voltammetric behavior appears to agree with the global mechanism proposed for oxidation of phenol group in aromatic compounds (Baizer and Lund, 1972). The hydroxy groups are oxidized via two electrons transfer leading to the generation of a correspondent quinone after liberation of 2H+. The results have indicated that the higher the number of hydroxy substituents on the aromatic ring, the lower the electrochemical potential. Thus, p-coumaric acids (monophenols) have a higher potential than caffeic and chlorogenic acids (diphenols). Such an order has already been deﬁned by Peyrat-Maillard et al. (2000). In spite of the number of phenolic hydroxyls, the oxidation potential of caffeic and chlorogenic acids also presented a reversible redox couple that was not seen for the oxidation of the other phenolic compounds. The voltammetric behavior indicates that the oxidation process can involve the formation of a stable quinone which is reduced in the reverse scan, as observed in the oxidation of other phenolic compounds with the hydroxy group at the ortho position (Baizer and Lund, 1972). In addition, the introduction of a quinic group on caffeic acid to give chlorogenic acid did not change the oxidation potential. However, the methoxylation of the phenolic groups (sinapic and ferulic acids) increases the peak potential and the rapid decomposition of the correspondent quinone makes the process appear to be an irreversible process since there is no reduction of quinone in the reverse scan. The antioxidant activity of standard phenolic compounds is usually measured according to the method of Cuvelier et al. (1992) based on the accelerated autooxidation of methyl linoleate in anhydrous dodecane using strong oxidizing conditions or by spectrophotometric test measuring the antiradical capacity via reduction of the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (Brand-Williams et al., 1995) or by cyclic voltammetry (Chevion et al., 2000), in addition to several other available methods (Punchard, 1996). In order to test the voltammetric results as a tool to evaluate the antioxidant capacity, the results were compared using the DPPH test (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each phenolic acid to reduce DPPH (see experimental section). Graphs of reduction of DDPH (%) as a function of different concentrations of phenolic compounds are shown in Fig. 3. The studied phenolic compounds showed free radical scavenging activity decreasing in the following sequence: caffeic acid>chlorogenic acid>sinapic acid>ferulic acid>coumaric acid. This behavior is attributed to the higher ability of diphenols to quench free radicals in solution by easier donation of hydrogen of hydroxy groups and to stabilize the respective radicalar forms due to electron delocalization. As expected, the antioxidant or antiradical activity of most phenolic acids is inversely proportional to their oxidation potential. Diphenols (caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid) show high radical scavenging activities and low oxidation potentials when compared with other acids. Monophenols (p-coumaric acid) are less active and respond at a higher potential which is however smaller than those substituted by methoxy groups (sinapic and ferulic acids). In fact, the potential value is dependent upon the redox behavior of the compounds, reﬂecting their ability to lose electrons. The comparison is similar to that veriﬁed with DPPH measurement. Moreover, the ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 625 signiﬁcant difference noticed for antioxidant activity for caffeic and chlorogenic acids is also conﬁrmed by the shape of the voltammograms which indicates oxidation processes with reversible electron transfer. So, the electrochemical oxidation could be used as a simple model to compare antioxidant activity based on the evaluation of the shape of the voltammogram and the oxidation potential. 3.2. Analysis of orange juice samples In order to investigate the analytical potential of the electrochemical oxidation in determining phenolic derivatives in orange juice, cyclic voltammograms were recorded after a direct transfer of 100–3000 mL of natural orange juice samples to the voltammetric cell containing 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammogram, obtained as described in the experimental section, is shown in Fig. 4. A well-deﬁned oxidation peak at +0.38 V with 3.08 mA of anodic peak current (blank correction) is observed after transference of 600 mL of orange juice Danones, with peak heights proportional to the orange juice addition. Cyclic voltammograms recorded after standard addition of phenolic derivatives from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1 promote an extra peak at more positive values following the sequence: sinapic (70 mV), ferulic (150 mV) and p-coumaric (360 mV) acids indicating that they are probably not contributing signiﬁcantly to the endogenous peak. Nevertheless, the standard addition of caffeic acid exhibited a concomitant increase in the peak current without any distortion of the peak potential. The same effect was observed with the standard addition of chlorogenic acid indicating that both contributions cannot be split. Interference of ascorbic acid was also tested under the same experimental conditions. Cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1 103 mol L1 of ascorbic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 presents ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 b c d a e fractional convertion of DPPH % Concentration µmol L-1 Fig. 3.

Measurements at T ¼ 25C and l ¼ 517 nm. W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 626 an irreversible oxidation peak at +0.42V, which was identiﬁed as potentially interfering in the analysis of phenolic compounds in orange juice, too. Similar results were obtained when the described method was applied to the determination of phenolic acids in commercial orange juice assigned as Batavos and Jussys. The voltammograms obtained for 600mL of orange juice in 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6 present oxidation peaks similar to those previously detected, with peak currents of 2.8270.21 and 2.7570.17mA (values represent means of triplicate determinations), respectively. The peak height increases with standard addition of caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid or ascorbic acid, indicating value media of total phenolic compounds of 244.8737mg L1 (n ¼ 3). So, taking into consideration the fact that cyclic voltammetry could provide information about the total antioxidant capacity, without the speciﬁc determination of the contribution of each individual component, the method was tested using activated glassy carbon electrode. 3.3. Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at modiﬁed glassy carbon electrode As described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997), glassy carbon electrode activated previously in bicarbonate solution can have its surface modiﬁed by active groups, where quinones, imidazolic groups and enzymes could be electrodeposited. Therefore, the analytical potentiality of the activated glassy carbon electrode obtained as described in the experimental section was investigated to determine phenolic compounds based on its interaction with the modiﬁed electrode. The voltammetric response of glassy carbon electrode activated by continuous potential cycles from 1.3 to +1.6 V at a sweep of 50 mV s1 (50 cycles) in sodium bicarbonate (0.1 mol L1) solution does not exhibit any electroactive sites in the potential range from –0.4 to +1.0 V. Two different deposition methods of phenolic compounds were employed. These methods involved dipping and cycling of the potential during the electrodeposition process.

Linear sweep voltammograms of 600 mL of orange juice Danones in 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6 before (Curve 1) and after standard addition of 4 105 mol L1 (Curve 2) and 1 104 mol L1 of caffeic acid on glassy carbon electrode. n ¼ 100 mV s1. W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 627 In the former method, the electrode was washed and transferred to a beaker containing 1 103 mol L1 of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6 solution. After carefully rinsing with water, the electrode was placed in a solution of 0.1 mol L1 acetate buffer previously purged with nitrogen. In the latter method, the activated electrode was rinsed and placed in a 1 103 mol L1 solution of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6, where it was submitted to seven potential cyclings between +0.1 and +0.8 V (at 50 mV s1). The electrode was then removed to a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for both methods using caffeic acid were recorded at 100 mV s1. A redox couple of peaks at +0.33/+0.30 V attributed to oxidation of phenol/quinone was observed for both methods, with characteristics close to those expected in a system involving surface process (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The voltammetric curves obtained using the cycling method present a higher peak intensity (Fig. 5). Successive scans (Curve n of Fig. 5) have shown constant values of current after the ﬁrst scan indicating that the remaining material is quite persistent on the electrode surface. The results obtained using the dipping method have shown repetitive voltammograms with continuous decay during the continuous scanning of potential indicating that the material is released due to weak bound to the surface. So, the results obtained for both processes indicate that caffeic acid can be deposited on the electrode surface due to a weak interaction with the phenolic group (dipping) or strong interaction with quinone groups generated after successive oxidation (cycling). The most effective method was the electrodeposition of caffeic acid onto glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution using cycling potential and it was chosen as the best condition for analysis of the phenolic compounds. The inﬂuence of cycling time from +0.1 to +0.8 V during accumulation of caffeic acid on the voltammetric response obtained for activated electrode was investigated immersing the previously ARTICLE IN PRESS 100 200 300 400 500 600 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 n 1 ip(µΑ) POTENTIAL (mV) Fig. 5.

After a controlled time, the load electrode was removed to the voltammetric cell containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The current increased linearly up to 5 min of exposition, showing that the analyte is easily and rapidly accumulated on the electrode surface. At higher time, the current reaches a plateau indicating saturation of the electrode surface. In order to assess the reproducibility of the electrode response, a series of 10 repetitive measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammograms (at 100 mV s1) recorded for the activated electrode immersed in 1 103 mol L1 caffeic acid solution and transported to a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The electrode response indicated a mean current peak value of 4.2470.12 mA, where the coefﬁcient of variation calculated was 4.3%. Under these experimental conditions, the calibration plots were tested immersing the coated electrode in caffeic acid solution containing 1 104– 1 103 mol L1 using a controlled time of cycling of 5 min. Linear relationship was observed between ipa vs. concentration from 1.0 104 to 7.5 104 mol L1 following the equation: ip (mA)=0.2796+7.813 103 (C=moles L1), r ¼ 0:9988; n ¼ 6: Constant values of peak current were always obtained above the concentration of 1 103 mol L1, as shown in Fig. 6, suggesting saturation of the electrode surface. The detection limit was calculated (LD=3 sd/slope) to be 1 105 mol L1. The cyclic voltammograms obtained using the procedure described previously have shown that chlorogenic acid can also be deposited on glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution. A pair of redox peaks is observed due to oxidation of chlorogenic acid loaded in the electrode surface with similar electrochemical behavior observed for caffeic acid. The oxidation processes of p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids on activated glassy carbon electrodes are quite different from the behavior described for caffeic and chlorogenic ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 2 4 6 8 10 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 Ip(µΑ) Concentration (x10-4 mol L-1) Fig. 6.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 629 acids. The cyclic voltammograms recorded after activated electrode transference to a voltammetric cell containing 1 103 mol L1 of these phenolic compounds exhibit the expected behavior of that veriﬁed at bare electrode. But, when the electrode is rinsed and placed in a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6 there is no voltammetric signal, indicating that there is no remaining material on the activated electrode surface. The electrodeposition mechanism of o-, p-quinones onto activated glassy carbon electrode has been described (Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997). The deposition of such compounds has been explained on the basis of a nucleophilic attack of quinones produced from the oxidation of phenolic compounds. When an activated glassy carbon electrode is used as a surface for electrooxidation of chlorogenic acid or caffeic acid, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the electrode act as nucleophiles against the o-quinone anodically formed. Such a process leads to bond formation and development of a stable modiﬁed electrode. The absence of o-hydroxyl substituents in the chemical structure or the irreversibility of the process observed during electrochemical oxidation, respectively, of p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids, probably hinders this interaction or enhances the release rate from the surface and reduces the utility of activated glassy carbon electrode to pre-concentrate these phenolic compounds. So, taking into consideration the selective interaction between activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic acid and/or chlorogenic compounds, without interference of ascorbic acid, the applicability of the method was tested in three different samples of orange juice. Quantiﬁcation of the caffeic acid content in orange juice was accomplished by multiple standard additions of caffeic acid on activated glassy carbon electrode as described in the experimental section. Five milliliters of the orange juice was directly diluted in the voltammetric cell by adding it to 15 mL of pH 5.6 acetate buffer. After 10 cycles between the potential of +0.1 and +0.8 V, the activated glassy carbon electrode was replaced in a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6 and characteristic cyclic voltammograms were obtained before and after the standard addition of caffeic acid. This method was also tested for aliquots of orange juice from 1.00 to 10.00 mL and the peak current increases up to a dilution limit of 50% in juice:buffer. The peak rise at +0.4 V obtained in all voltammograms also increases with the amount of chlorogenic acid added as standard solution addition but has not shown any interference of p-coumaric, sinapic, ferulic or ascorbic acid, indicating that the modiﬁed electrode has shown high selectivity to caffeic acid or chlorogenic acid determination. The results obtained using the proposed method based on standard addition of caffeic acid are shown in Curves A and B of Fig. 7. The results obtained from the repetitions indicate that 2.4270.28 mg L1 of caffeic/chlorogenic acids are present in the Batavo orange juice samples.

The results obtained using the proposed method are in agreement with the values provided by the literature (Robards and Antolovich, 1995) which indicate that caffeic and chlorogenic acids are the major cinnamic acid derivatives in orange juice and their usual concentrations are around 0.1–2 mg L1 in commercial orange juices. 4.

In addition, it is becoming very difﬁcult to discover new leads structures solely by synthetic means [1]. Therefore, modern strategies for discovering new agrochemical, i.e. insecticides, herbicides, etc. are focused on natural products, because they often have a reduced environmental impact, are biodegradable and may have new sites of interaction and speci- ﬁcity. In a program oriented towards the discovery of novel photo- synthetic inhibitors, we identiﬁed diverse secondary metabolites such as chromenes, benzofurans, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, lac- tones, and terpenes from selected Mexican plants [2]. Furoquinoline alkaloids have attracted much interest due to their broad range of biological activities including various physiological and pharmaco- logical activities [3,4]. In a previous work bioactive constituents from Swinglea glutinosa (Rutaceae) [4–7], and from Hortia superba (Rutaceae) were isolated and characterized. Quinolone alkaloids, ﬂindersine, N-methyl-ﬂindersine and acridone alkaloids inhibit the light reactions of photosynthesis [8]. The acridone alkaloids that contain 2,3,5,6-dehydro-4-oxopiperidine nucleus were the most ac- tive. As a contribution on the research of the Rutaceae family, in this work we report the isolation of ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids: evoli- trine (1), kokusaginine (2), c-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4) and mac- ulosidine (5) (Fig. 1) from a Brazilian tree Balfourodendron riedelianum. The plant is used in the Brazilian folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments [9]. In the search for natural product that may have herbicide activity, we studied ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids and found that four of them act as photosynthetic inhibitors. We investigated the mechanism of action of furoquinoline alkaloids 1– 5 on the light reaction of photosynthesis and their possible targets on the electron transport chain on thylakoids and leaves discs. Among the techniques suitable for assessing the electron transport ﬂow in the light reactions of photosynthesis on plants subjected to chemical stress, polarography (measuring oxygen evolution and using appropriate electron acceptors, donors and inhibitors) and ﬂuorescence induction curves of chlorophyll a of photosystem II (PS II) were employed in the present work. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence data were analyzed by the ‘‘JIP-test analysis’’ [10]. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Stock solutions of 1–5 were prepared using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as solvent and its maximum concentration in the medium was less than 0.5%. Log P Parameters and Molar volume of the alkaloids were deter- mined for each compound by the program Chem stech from www.ACD labs.com. 2.2. Puriﬁcation and Isolation of the furoquinoline alkaloids (1–5) The dichloromethane extract (2.1 g) obtained from the stem barks of B. riedelianum was subjected to a counter current chroma- tography, in the RLCC (Rotation Locular Counter Chromatography, RLCC-1000, Eyela ceramic bomb VSP-3050) apparatus using chlo- roform/methanol/isopropanol/water (45:60:2:40), as stationary phase in an automatic collector (Eyela fraction collector DC-120). The apparatus loop was 3.0 mL to give a group of 24 fractions in a chloroform solution stationary phase (0.3626 g), which was subjected to a column over Sephadex LH-20 (430 mm 30 mm, 300 g) and the elution was carried out with methanol (100%) to give 7 fractions. From the fraction 3 (0.0902 g) the alkaloid 3 was obtained and from the fraction 6 (0.0137 g) 1 and 2 were isolated, and the compound 4 was isolated from the fraction 5 (0.0437 g). These metabolites were identiﬁed by spectroscopic and spectro- metric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, including 2D experiments (HSQC and HMBC), the data were compared with previous report [12–14]. A solution of methanol/H2O (25%) of the methanol extract (58.6 g) obtained from the stem bark of Balfourodendrum riedelia- num and then subjected to a liquid extraction to get n-hexane (5.5 g), dichloromethane (26.4 g) and ethyl acetate (2.8 g) frac- tions. The dichloromethane fraction was subjected to a chromato- graphic column (silica ﬂash, 47.0 5.5 cm). The gradient elution was carried out with hexane to methanol, giving eleven fractions. The fraction 9 (1.45 g) gave rise to a new chromatographic column [silica ﬂash + ﬂorisil (1:1), 70.0 2.5 cm] with gradient of elution (hexane to methanol) providing seven fractions (I–VII). The frac- tion IV (0.95 g) was subjected to another silica ﬂash/Florisil (1:1) column (71.0 2.5 cm, eluted with gradient of hexane – ethyl ace- tate), giving ﬁve new fractions (A–E). The fraction E (0.06 g) was subjected to a preparative thin-layer chromatography (20 20 cm, 1 mm), eluted with dichloromethane (100%) to isolate maculosidine (5) (0.02 g). This compound was identiﬁed with spec- troscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, as previ- ously reported [12–14]. 2.3. Chloroplasts isolation and chlorophyll determination Intact chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves (Spinacea oleracea L.) obtained from a local market as previously described [15,16]. Chloroplasts were isolated with a medium that contained: 400 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and buffered with 3 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, then they were re-suspended in the same medium and stored as a concentrated suspension in the dark for 1 h at 0 C. 2.4. Measurement of ATP synthesis To measure ATP synthesis, intact chloroplasts (20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were broken by osmotic rupture in the following low-buffered solution: 100 mM sorbitol, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM KCN, 50 lM methylviologen (MV) (as electron acceptor at FX level), 1 mM K+-tricine (pH 8.0), and 1 mM ADP, pH adjusted to 8.0 with KOH. The ATP synthesis was determined titrimetrically using a microelectrode Orion model 8103 Ross connected to a Corning potentiometer model 12, with expanded scale as previ- ously reported [15,17]. The linear rate of alkalization in the light was calibrated by back-titration with saturated HCl, the ATP formed was calculated as lmol ATP mg Chl1 h1. 2.5. Measurement of non-cyclic electron transport rate The Light-induced non-cyclic electron transport activity from water to MV was determined with an oxygen monitors YSI (Yellow Springs Instrument) model 5300 using a Clark type electrode as previously published [15,18]. Chloroplasts (equivalent of 20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were freshly lysed in 3 mL of the basal electron transport reaction med- ium: 100 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KCN, 30 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, and 50 lM MV and measured the basal electron ﬂow by polarography. Phosphorylating non-cyclic elec- tron transport from water to MV was measured as basal non-cyclic electron transport medium except that 1 mM ADP and 3 mM KH2- PO4 were added to the reaction medium. Uncoupled electron trans- port from water to MV was tested as the basal non-cyclic electron transport, and 6 mM NH4Cl was added as uncoupler to the med- ium. All reaction mixture was illuminated for 1 min with an actinic light of a projector lamp (GAF 2660) passed through a 5 cm ﬁlter of CuSO4 at 2% w/v.

Uncoupled photosystem II (PS II) and Uncoupled photosystem I (PS I) electron ﬂow determination Uncoupled PS II from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) [19] was monitored polarographically. DCBQ accepts elec- trons at the D1 protein, and thus we measured the electron trans- port from water to QB. The reaction medium for assaying PS II activity was the same used for basal electron transport, except that MV was omitted and 1 lM 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4- benzoquinone (DBMIB), 100 lM DCBQ and 6 mM NH4Cl were added. Partial reaction of PS II electron transport from water to so- dium silicomolybdate (SiMo) was determined as in PS II with the same basal electron transport medium without MV, and 50 lM SiMo and 10 lM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were added [20]. These electron ﬂow activities were monitored with a yellow spring instrument (YSI) oxygen monitor, model 5300 using a Clark type electrode. Uncoupled PS I electron transport was determined using the basal electron transport medium, plus 10 lM DCMU (to inhibit PSII at QB level), 100 lM of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) were re- duced with 300 lM ascorbate and uncoupled with 6 mM NH4Cl [21]. The I50 value for each activity was extrapolated using the graph of percentage of activity versus concentration of compounds. I50 is the concentration producing 50% inhibition of the activity. 2.7. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II measurements in thylakoids Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence transients were measured with a Handy-PEA (Plant Efﬁcient Analyzer, from Hansatech, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, UK) as previously described [16]. The maximum ﬂuores- cence yield from the sample was generated by illumination for 2 s with continuous light (650 nm peak wavelength, intensity equivalent of 2830 lmol photons m2 s1 and gain of 0.7.) pro- vided by an array of three light-emitting diodes. The reaction med- ium used was that employed in basal non-cyclic electron transport measurements with MV. To monitor Chl a ﬂuorescence transients, aliquots of dark-adapted thylakoids for 5 min containing 60 lg of Chl were transferred to ﬁlter paper by gravity with a dot-blot appa- ratus (Bio-Rad, United States) in order to ensure a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of thylakoids. The ﬁlter paper was dipped immediately in 3 mL of the medium with different concen- trations of the tested compounds, and the control contained med- ium plus the amount of DMSO employed for each compound at the different used concentrations. Chloroplasts inﬁltrated with 10 lM DCMU and chloroplasts pre- viously treated with 0.8 M Tris ((hydroxymetyl)-aminomethan) were used as positive control. Chloroplasts were incubated with slight agitation for 30 min at 4 C with 0.8 M Tris at pH 8.0 [22]. The OJIP transients were analyzed according to the JIP test and the measured parameters were: ﬂuorescence intensity level (Fo) when plastoquinone electron acceptor pool (QA) is fully oxidized and ﬂuorescence level when QA is transiently fully reduced (FM). F1 is the ﬂuorescence intensity level at 0.05 ms, F2 at 0.1 ms, F3 at 0.3 ms, F4 or FJ at 2 ms, F5 at 30 ms. Area is the area over the curve between Fo and FM, and relates the pool size of PS II electron trans- port acceptors [23]. From these parameters other derived parame- ters were calculated (Table 1) with the program Biolyzer HP3 (from Laboratory University of Geneva; available at http://www. unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen). The ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a transients were normalized using the equation Vt = (Ft Fo)/ FM Fo), and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients is called ‘‘relative variable ﬂuorescence’’, if plotted versus time revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band near to 2 ms, is an indication of the Q A concentration is increased [10]. VOJ is the relative variable ﬂuorescence between Fo and FJ and is calculated as VOJ (t) = FVt/(FJ Fo) = (Ft Fo)/(FJ Fo) and plotted versus time. If a K-band appeared near to 0.3 ms indicate a damaged in the water splitting system on thylakoids [10]. 2.8. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence measurements in spinach leaf discs Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence on discs from dark-adapted spinach leaf was measured with the same equipment and conditions used for thylakoids. Fifteen spinach leaf discs (7 mm diameter) were placed in each Petri dishes with 10 mL of modiﬁed Krebs solution which contained: 115 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM Na2SO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 25 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4), then were incubated for 4 h at room tempera- ture, after this time, different concentrations of compound was added to each Petri dish. The leaf discs were incubated for 4 h more in the presence of the compounds, then, they were dark adapted for 30 min and afterwards the ﬂuorescence of the chlorophyll a was measured. The same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used for the samples treated with the analyzed compounds was added to the control samples for eliminating the solvent effect. 2.9. Plant material for in vivo assays The seeds of Physalis ixocarpa and Lolium perenne, a weed spe- cies, were sown in 12 cm diameter pots and were watered daily in the greenhouse at 25–30 C. After 15 and 18 days of emergence for P. ixocarpa and L. perenne, respectively, the plants were selected for similar size and were sprayed manually with the compounds 1 and 2 at concentrations of 150 and 300 lM. A stock of 20 mM of each compound was prepared in DMSO and an aliquot of this solu- tion was taken to obtain the desired concentration in an aqueous suspension containing 0.05% w/v of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The control group was sprayed with dis- tilled water containing the same amount of DMSO and Tween-20. 2.10. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence determination in intact leaves in vivo This was performed at room temperature with a portable Handy PEA apparatus [11] in the leaves of dark adapted-plants for 15 min both on the control and on the treated plants after 24, 40 and 72 h of being sprayed with the compounds. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Inhibition of ATP synthesis To know the effect of the furoquinoline alkaloids 1–5 on photo- phosphorylation, they were assayed on freshly lysed spinach chlo- roplasts. ATP synthesis was inhibited by 1, 2, 4 and 5 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The I50 values for this activity were 83.5 and 59.0 lM for 1 and 2, respectively; 4 and 5 had the same value 50.5 lM and 3 was almost inactive and it was not further studied (Fig. 2). 3.2. Effect of the natural furoquinoline alkaloids on chloroplast electron transport rate The light-dependent photophosphorylation is coupled to elec- tron transport rate and can be inhibited by different ways: by blocking the electron transport, by direct inhibition of the H+-ATP- ase, or by uncoupling the ATP synthesis process from the electron transport [24]. To elucidate the mechanism of action of the furo- quinoline alkaloids on photosynthesis, their effects on non- cyclic electron transport (basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled) from water to MV were investigated. 38 T.A.M. Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 Furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited basal, phosphor- ylating, and uncoupled electron transport as their concentrations increased up to 200 lM. The I50 values for uncoupled electron transport rate were 21.0, 18.6, 23.4 and 22.8 lM, respectively (Table 2). Compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the electron ﬂow (in basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions) and ATP syn- thesis; therefore they act as Hill reaction inhibitors. Other natural products that act as Hill reaction inhibitors are the biﬂavonoid iso- lated from Seleginella lepydophylla, robustaﬂavone [25] or the fur- anoditerpene canophyllol isolated from Celastrus vulcanicola) [16]. 3.3. Localization of furoquinoline alkaloids interaction sites on the light reaction of photosystem PS II and photosystem PS I and partial reactions To localize the inhibition site of the alkaloids on the thylakoid electron transport chain, their effects on PS II, PS I and photosys- tems partial reactions were tested using artiﬁcial electron donors and acceptors, as well as appropriate inhibitors [21]. Table 3 shows that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the uncoupled PS II electron ﬂow from water to DCBQ; 1 inhibited PS II 100% at a concentration of 300 lM, however, alkaloids 2, 4 and 5 inhibited partially this activity (81%, 67% and 89%, respectively) at the same concentration (300 lM); therefore, 1 was the most active compound inhibiting the PS II electron transport. To further localize the inhibition site of the furoquinolines on the PS II electron transport chain, their effects were measured on the electron ﬂow from water to SiMo (SiMo ac- cepts electrons from pheophytin, so in this way the electron ﬂow measurements are from the water splitting enzyme to pheophy- tin). The results indicate that1, 2, 4 and 5 did not affect this partial reaction, since the rate of treated thylakoids were similar to the control (data not shown), therefore, all active furoquinoline alka- loids inhibited the electron transport chain beyond the pheophytin site [20]. The polarographic measurements suggest that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited electron transport between QA and QB of PS II, at the D1 protein by displacing QB, similar to how DCMU herbicide acts. The mechanism action of 1, 2, 4 and 5 is similar to other natural prod- ucts like trachyloban-19-oic acid [26], ﬂindersine [4]. Uncoupled PS I electron transport rate was measured by polar- ography from reduced DCPIP to MV by using increasing concentra- tions of the alkaloids tested, in order to ﬁnd if they affect this photosystem. The results of these studies showed that the rate for control and treated samples were similar, therefore the furo- quinoline alkaloids do not interact with PS I electron transport chain (data not shown). 3.4. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in thylakoids in the presence of the furoquinoline alkaloids To corroborate the polarography results about the interaction site of the furoquinoline alkaloids at PS II, ﬂuorescence of chloro- phyll a were measured on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts incu- bated for 5 min in the dark at room temperature. Control chloroplast contained the amount of DMSO used for each treat- ment, the treated chloroplasts contained various concentrations of the compounds (each concentration was measured three times); chloroplasts incubated with Tris and 10 lM DCMU were used as positive control (Fig. 3). Chlorophyll a induction curves of thylak- oids control (Fig. 3) showed an OJIP sequence similar to that previously described for plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria [27] except that phase IP was in part suppressed due to the effect of MV [28]. The chloroplasts inﬁltrated with DCMU and the control samples showed almost identical FM level (Table 4). However, the FM level of treated chloroplasts decreased respect to the control, while the Fo was not been affected by almost all the compounds tested; only 1 increased lightly the Fo level. The ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a transients were normalized, and the difference be- tween the treated and control normalized transients revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band (Fig. 4A). The ﬂuorescence rise to the J-band provides information Table 1 Derived parameters, their description and formulae using data extracted from the chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence (OJIP) transient presented in this paper.

Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 39 about single turnover events of the primary reactions of the photo- chemistry, mainly QA reduction, indicating that the electron trans- port beyond QA is blocked at the QB level as DCMU does, suggesting that 1 interacts at this site and the unused energy is dissipated as heat [10]. In Fig. 4A, a small H-band was observed after 100 ms and closer to 1000 ms, this band is due to the electron acceptor MV ef- fect [28]. In Fig. 4B, a K-band is observed in chloroplasts treated with Tris 0.8 M. Even though a small K-band is also observable in chloroplasts treated with DCMU, this band can be to the solvent ef- fect of the ethanol where the DCMU was dissolved [28], however, the furoquinoline alkaloids were dissolved in DMSO as solvent and it have not any effect on the ﬂuorescence induction curve. Furthermore, the Fm value in the presence of DCMU plus MV is similar to the control sample (Table 4). In chloroplasts treated with furoquinolines alkaloids plus MV decreased Fm and the parameters derived from the JIP test (see Table 1) had similar behavior with DCMU treatment (Fig. 5), with the parameter dR0 exception, [it reﬂects the efﬁciency with which an electron can move from the reduced electron acceptors coming of the intersystem to the PS I (reducing site)] [29]; this parameter was slightly increased by the furoquinoline treatments (with DCMU treatment it drastically diminished). Values like REo/CS, REo/RC and uRo decreased with all treatments, being more drastic for DCMU. These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electrons transport chain in two sites, one at donor and the other on the acceptor side in PS II (Fig. 5). The effect of furoquinoline alkaloids site at the donor side was detected only by the technique of ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a of PS II, and not by polarography technique [10]. 3.5. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in leaf discs To know if the alkaloids can reach their targets on the photo- synthesis electron transport chain, ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a induction curves were measured in discs obtained from fresh spinach leaves. In Fig. 6A the OJIP sequences for control and discs treated with the most active furoquinoline 1 (in this case MV was omitted from the medium) showed a rise in the J peak. In discs treated with 1, 2, and 5 at concentration of 400 lM, the differences between normalized curves and control showed a J-band (Fig. 6B). Furthermore 4 did not show any effect on the discs ﬂuorescence (data not shown). J-band for 1 was bigger than for 2 and 5 (Fig. 6B). Also 1 and 2 showed a small K-band while compound 5 lacks this band (Fig. 6C). When the transients were normalized between FM and F5, a band in the IP region ap- peared (30 ms to about 300 ms) for compounds 2 and 5 (Fig. 6D).

In addition, the quantum yield for the reduction of PSI end acceptors per photon absorbed also increased. These results suggest that end acceptors of PS I cannot be reduced because the electrons from PS II are not available. The parameters for 2 and 5 are similar to the con- trol (Fig. 7) indicating that these compounds do not reach com- pletely their target.

In vivo assays In order to conﬁrm if 1 can penetrate the intact whole leaf and affect the plants in vivo, this compound was sprayed on the leaves of L. perenne and P. ixocarpa plants after 15 days of growth in the green house. Studies of chlorophyll a Fluorescence were performed on the plants after 24, 48 and 72 h of being sprayed with 1 at 150 and 300 lM. The results showed non-signiﬁcant inhibiting growth effect. These results suggest that 1 does not overcome the natural barriers provided by the plants, since the chlorophyll a and dry bio- mass of these plants were not affected by 1 (data not shown). 4. Conclusions The results indicated that furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited ATP synthesis and electron transport in spinach chloro- plasts while 3 was inactive. The inhibition site of alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 was located at the acceptor side of PS II by polarographic technique. When these results were corroborated by chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II data; we found that the donor side of PSII is inhibited by these furoquinoline alkaloids. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence measurements on leaf discs treated with furoquinoline alka- loids showed changes in the induction curve of ﬂuorescence only with 1, transforming the OJIP trace at OJ step, showing a J band which indicates that only 1 can reach its inhibition target. However when 1 was sprayed on intact whole leaves, this compound could not penetrate the leaves plant natural barriers. Furthermore, 1 with two methoxy groups has the lowest molar volume unlike com- pounds 2, 4 and 5 with 3 methoxy groups and therefore larger mo- lar volumes which make more difﬁcult their translocation in the leaves. Also alkaloid 3 has a lower molar volume, but it has a LogP value of 2.70, similar to compounds 4 and 5. However, 1 has a high- er LogP value of 3.20 suggesting that this compound fulﬁlls the speciﬁc structure requirements for inhibiting PSII electron trans- port chain in leaf discs that the other furoquinoline alkaloids stud- ied lack these characteristics.

Introduction The Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families are rich sources of quinonemethide triterpenes (Br€uning and Wagner, 1978; Gunatilaka, 1996), and these compounds have a variety of biological activities such as antitumor (Bhatnagar et al., 1979; Goncalves de Lima et al., 1971), antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971); antibi- otic (Goncalves de Lima et al., 1969; Gonzalez et al., 1977); cytotoxic (Setzer et al., 1998) and antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989; Figueiredo et al., 1998) proper- ties. Systematic studies on Celastraceae and Hippo- crateaceae plant species (Corsino et al., 1998a,b,c, 2000, 2003; Buﬀa Filho et al., 2002) have been concerned with biosynthesis of quinonemethide triterpenes, the main secondary metabolites in this taxon. The biosynthetic study dealing on Maytenus aquifolium (Celastraceae) and Salacia campestris (Hippocrateaceae) indicated that friedelane triterpenes are putative precursors of qui- nonemethide triterpenes, which are biosynthesized in the leaves and translocated to the root bark, where these compounds would be transformed into quinonemethide triterpenes (Corsino et al., 2000). These ﬁndings have led us to investigate other species of Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae. Cheiloclinium cognatum (Miers) A.C. Sm. (Hippocrateaceae) a tree widely distributed in the Cerrado region of Brazil, was selected to investigate the oxidative transformation on the E ring of the quinon- emethide triterpenes. With this objective, we carried out a chemical study on this plant species, which led to the isolation of two new triterpenes, 22b-hydroxypristimerin (1) and cognatine (2), besides seven known quinon- emethide triterpenes; pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5), 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6), netzahualcoyonol (7), netzahualcoyondiol (8) and net- zahualcoyone (9). The free radical scavenging activities of the isolates have been evaluated through a spectro- photometric assay using the stable free radical 2,2-di- phenyl-picryl hydrazyl(DPPH). * Corresponding author.

Results and discussion A CH2Cl2 soluble fraction obtained from the ethan- olic extract of the root bark C. cognatum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further puriﬁed by preparative TLC and/ or HPLC, aﬀording compounds 1–9. 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1), obtained as a red amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C30H40O5 by analysis of its ESI/MS spectrum, elemental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 3450 cm1 (hydroxyl group) and 1724 and 1645 cm1 (carbonyl groups). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of six methyl singlets at d 2.13, 1.38, 1.22, 1.15, 0.99 and 0.41, attributed to H3-23, H3-25, H3-26, H3-30, H3-28 and H3-27, respectively, (Table 1). The quinon- emethide moiety was characterized by a doublet at d 6.26 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz), a singlet at d 6.41 (1H) and a doublet at d 6.94 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz) attributed to H-7, H-1 and H-6, respectively. The singlet at d 2.13, char- acteristic of a methyl group attached to a sp2 carbon (H3-23), corroborated the presence of a quinonemethide system. Further oxygenated functional groups were as- sumed to be hydroxyl and ester on the basis of NMR spectral analysis. The 13C NMR, gHMBC and gHMQC spectra (Table 2) showed the presence of 30 carbons in 1. In the 13C NMR spectrum two carbonyl carbon signals (d 178.2 and d 178.3) attributed to C-29 and C-2, re- spectively, six methyl carbons (d 38.1, 32.2, 24.0, 21.6, 19.0 and 10.1), six methylene carbons (d 38.1, 36.1, 33.5, 30.8, 29.5 and 28.2), four methine carbons (d 134.0, 119.5, 118.0 and 46.1), 10 quaternary carbons (d 169.7, 164.6, 146.0, 127.3, 117.2, 44.5, 42.6, 42.4, 39.2 and 38.2), one methoxyl carbon (d 51.6) and one hydroxy- methine carbon (d 67.9) were observed. The assignments were based on gHMQC and gHMBC spectra and by comparison with published data on pristimerin (Guna- tilaka, 1989, 1996). The correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum from the singlet at d 0.99 (H3-28) to the hydroxymethine carbon at d 67.9 (Fig. 1) and the signals at d 36.1 (C-16), 38.1 (C-17) and 46.1 (C-18), conﬁrmed the attachment of the hydroxyl group at C- 22. The relative stereochemistry of H-22 was deduced by the coupling constant values (d 4.02, J22ax=21ax ¼ 11:0 Hz and J22ax=21eq ¼ 4:0 Hz), which corroborated the equa- torial orientation of the hydroxyl group. The ester group was conﬁrmed by a singlet at d 3.50 (3H) attributed to a methoxyl portion of the ester group at C-29, which was conﬁrmed by means of correlation of the methyl group at d 1.15 (C-30) with the carbonyl carbon of the ester group at d 178.2 (C-29) observed in the gHMBC spec- trum (Fig. 1). The structure of 1 was determined as 22b- hydroxypristimerin. Cognatine (2), isolated as a pale yellow amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C31H38O7 by means of analysis of ESI/MS data, ele- mental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl group at 3438 cm1 and carbonyl groups at 1718 and 1643 cm1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of two singlets at d 6.85 (1H), attributed to H-1 and at d 6.00 (1H) assigned to H-7. Also, two methoxyl groups signals at d 3.73 and 3.74 (3H, each) were ob- served, which were characterized as methoxyl groups attached to C-3 and belonging to the ester group at C- Table 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1 and 2 [500 MHz, d (ppm), multiplicity, J (Hz), CDC13] Position 1 2 1 6.41 (s) 6.85 (s) 6 6.94 (d, J6;7 ¼ 6; 5 Hz) – 7 6.26 (d, J7;6 ¼ 6; 5 Hz) 6.00 (s) 21 – 4.95 (s) 22 4.02 (dd, J22ax;21ax ¼ 11:0 Hz and J22ax;21eq ¼ 4:0 Hz) – 23 2.13 (s) 2.67 (s) 25 1.38 (s) 1.33 (s) 26 1.22 (s) 1.72 (s) 27 0.41 (s) 0.90 (s) 28 0.99 (s) 1.38 (s) 30 1.15 (s) 0.95 (s) OCH3 at C-29 3.50 (s) 3.74 (s) OCH3 at C-3 – 3.73 (s) 1978 A.H.

Other singlets integrating for 3H each were observed at d 2.67, assigned to a methyl group on aro- matic ring (H3-23), at d 1.72 assigned to one methyl group on double bond (C-26) and at d 1.38, 1.33, 0.95 and 0.90, corresponding to tertiary methyl groups (H3- 28, H3-25, H3-30 and H3-27, respectively). The analysis of the 13C NMR (Table 2), gHMQC and gHMBC spectral data indicated the presence of three carbonyl carbons at d 214.0, 185.8 and 175.2 attributed to C-22, C-6 and C-29, respectively, six methyl groups at d 27.6, 23.9, 22.5, 21.7, 15.1 and 13.7, attributed to C-25, C-27, C-28, C-26, C-23 and C-30, respectively, two vinylic carbons at d 134.7 and 125.9, two vinylic carbons conjugated to carbonyl groups at d 160.1 and 129.3, four methylene carbons at d 38.0, 37.1, 35.8 and 34.2, one methine carbon at d 46.2, ﬁve quaternary aromatic carbons at d 151.7, 151.2, 144.7, 134.0 and 122.4. The remaining signal was an unsubstituted aromatic carbon (d 110.1), which was assigned to C-l.

Jeller et al. / Phytochemistry 65 (2004) 1977–1982 1979 nals for four quaternary carbons (d 42.2, 40.7, 48.8 and 50.3), two sp3 carbons belonging to methoxyl groups (d 52.7 and 61.7) and one hydroxymethine carbon at d 74.3 were also observed. The gHMBC data (Fig. 2) showed the correlation of the singlet at d 6.85 (H-l) to the carbons at d 151.7 (C-2), d 144.7 (C-3), d 122.4 (C-5) and d 42.2 (C-9) and the singlet at d 6.00 (H-7) to the carbons at d 134.7 (C-4), d 122.4 (C-5) and d 42.2 (C-9) corroborating unambigu- ously the assignments of H-l and H-7. Besides, the signal at d 6.85 (1H, H-l) was correlated to d 110.1 (C-l) and the signal at d 6.00 (1H, H-7) showed correlation to d 129.3 (C-7) in the HMQC spectrum. The correlation between the methoxy signal at d 3.73 and the carbon signal at d 144.7 conﬁrmed the position of the methoxyl group at C-3. Also, the gHMBC spectrum showed cor- relations from the signal at d 1.22 (H3-26) to signals at d 125.9 and d 134.7, assigned to carbons C-14 and C-15, respectively. The signal at d 1.38 (H3-28) showed cor- relations with the carbon signal at d 38.0 (C-16) and also with the carbonyl signal at d 214.0, which conﬁrmed the position of one carbonyl group at C-22. An additional correlation from the methyl signal at d 1.72 (H3-26) to the carbon at d 38.0 (C-16) corroborated the attribution of the other carbonyl at C-6, with the chemical shift at d 185.6 being characteristic of an a,b-unsaturated car- bonyl and C-16, a methylenic carbon. The remaining gHMBC correlations from H3-30 (d 0.95) to C-19 (d 34.2) and the hydroxymethine carbon at C-21 (d 74.3), besides correlation of methoxyl hydrogens at d 3.74 with the carbonyl signal at C-29 (d 175.2), established the proposed structure 2 for cognatine. The known compounds pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5) and 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6) were identiﬁed by comparison with published data (Gunatilaka, 1989; Gunatilaka, 1996; Dhanabalasing- ham et al., 1996; Furlan et al., 1990). Compounds 7–9 had been previously isolated from Orthosphenia mexi- cana (Gonzalez et al., 1983), but a number of incon- sistencies were found regarding the assignments of published 13C NMR data. The analysis of 2D NMR spectra allowed accurate assignment of 13C NMR signals mostly based on gHMQC and gHMBC experiments. The spectrophotometric assay using DPPH indicated a prominent free radical scavenging activity for some of the isolated quinonemethide triterpenes (Fig. 3). The stable free radical DPPH has an absorption maximum at 517 nm, which decreases upon reduction through reaction with an antioxidant compound. The free radical scavenging activity of quinonemethide triterpenes is mostly due to the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety with extended conjugation through ring B, e.g. in compounds 1 and 3–6 or B–D, e.g. in compounds 7–9. These fea- tures stabilize the quinonemethide free radical promptly formed after loss of one radical hydrogen, donated to the DPPH. The more extended conjugations of triter- penes 7–9 account for their higher free radical scav- enging abilities (ca. 45% inhibition at 60 lM) when compared to compounds 1–6 (less than 30% inhibition at 60 lM). The phenolic triterpene 2 exhibited the lowest activity (18% at 60 lM) probably due to the lack of conjugation through rings B–D. The free radical scav- enging ability of the quinonemethide triterpenes and a standard compound rutin (66% inhibition at 60 lM) are due to catechol moiety present in the B ring of rutin the C2–C3 double bond (van Acker et al., 1996). The syn- thetic antioxidant BHT (11% inhibition at 60 lM) ex- hibited the weakest antiradical activity as expected due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH (Bondet et al., 1997). 3. Experimental 3.1. Plant material Root barks of C. cognatum (Hippocrateaceae) were collected at Universidade Federal de Goias, Goi^ania, GO and identiﬁed by Dr Julio Ant^onio Lombardi (Departamento de Bot^anica do Institute de Ci^encias Biol^ogicas – Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG). A voucher specimen (No. 19797) is deposited at Herbarium of Institute de Ci^encias Biol^ogicas – UFG, Goias. 3.2. Instrumentation and chromatography Silica gel (Merck, 230–400 and 70–230 mesh) were used for CC unless otherwise stated and solvents were distilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were re- corded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HPLC separations were performed using a Shimadzu LC-10AS. Preparative HPLC separation were performed on a Varian PROSTAR, using a reversed phase column (Phenomenex-Luna C18, 21.2 250 mm, 0 20 40 60 80 100 5 10 20 40 80 100 concentration (µM) (Ao-A)/Ao (%) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 rutin BHT Fig. 3.

ESI-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin–Elmer. 3.3. Extraction and isolation of constituents Dried and powdered root barks of C. cognatum (690.0 g) were extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to aﬀord a brown gum (210.6 g), which was submitted to liquid– liquid partitioning. The CH2C12 soluble part of the EtOH extract was concentrated in vacuo (25.5 g), sub- mitted to a silica gel column (600 g, 70–230 mesh) eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient, yielding 41 fractions (A1–A41). Fraction A9–A11 (1.48 g) was submitted to a ﬂash silica gel CC (230–400 mesh), eluted with a hexane/ EtOAc gradient resulting in 32 fractions (B1–B41). Fraction B10–B14 (0.154 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] yielding compound 3 (55 mg). Fraction B18–B21 (0.085 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] aﬀording compound 4 (34 mg). Fraction A16–A17 (3.55 g) was submitted to ﬂash silica gel CC (70–230 mesh), eluted with hexane/EtOAc gra- dient, resulting in 46 fractions (C1–C46). Fraction C19– C23 (0.221 g) was submitted to a reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 ml min1] to aﬀord compounds 1 (63 mg) and 8 (65 mg). Fraction A22–A26 (2.46 g) was subjected to a ﬂash silica gel CC eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 77 fractions (D1–D77). Fraction D23–D27 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0.05%] aﬀording compounds 5 (13 mg) and 6 (23 mg). Fraction D17–D22 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0,05%, three elutions] and further puriﬁed by reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 mL min1] aﬀording compounds 7 (18 mg) and 2 (4 mg). 3.4. Radical scavenging activity on DPPH radical Radical scavenging activity was assayed according to the Blois method (Blois, 1958). The free radical scav- enging capacities of quinonemethide triterpenes and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated based on their ability to reduce the free radical already assigned (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubi- lized in methanol (10 ml) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 to 100 lM were then prepared in MeOH and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated (see Fig. 3). 3.5. 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1) Amorphous solid.

Introduction Endophytic fungi are organisms living within the tissues of hosts plants (Andrews and Hirano, 1991). These organ- isms are known as potential sources of biologically active secondary metabolites (Dreyfuss and Chapela, 1994; Tan and Zou, 2001; Strobel et al., 2004) and relatively little is known about the potential of these microorganisms from Brazilian endemic plant species (Azevedo et al., 2000, 2004). As part of our studies on bioactive agents from metabo- lites produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado, we initially selected 16 species of plants, which had already been phy- tochemically proﬁled by our group. Those species were submitted for isolation of endophytic fungi and 82 pure isolates were obtained, preserved, cultivated in liquid media and extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain crude extracts. Some metabolites produced by fungi were already published by our group (Teles et al., 2005; Cafeˆu et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005). The crude EtOAc extract of Phomopsis cassiae isolated from Cassia spectabilis showed moderate antifungal activ- ity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladospo- rium cladosporioides, stimulating further studies. Bioassay guided fractionation of this extract aﬀorded ﬁve new ses- quiterpenes (1–5). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular for- mula C15H22O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 273.1486). Their IR spectra revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm1) and phenolic groups (1466, 1690 cm1). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) showed two aromatic signals, one at d 6.87 (1H, s) and the other at d 6.43 (1H, s), sug- gesting a tetra-substituted aromatic spin-system with a para conﬁguration. A series of complex signals at d 3.76 (1H, m) 3.35 (4H, m); d 3.04 (1H, m) and d 2.30 (1H, m) were indicative of two carbinolic and two benzyl hydrogens, respectively. Further signals at d 0.51 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 1.03 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 2.05 (3H, s) revealed the presence of two aliphatic and one aromatic methyl groups in the molecule. The 13C NMR chemical shifts for 1 along with the infor- mation obtained from a DEPT-135 experiment (Table 1), indicated a total of 15 signals, suggesting a sesquiterpene: six aromatic carbons at d 152.9 (s), 141.1 (s), 128.1 (d), 127.4 (s), 121.9 (s) and 114.7 (d), conﬁrming the tetra-sub- stitution for the aromatic moiety and the para hydrogen system; two carbinolic signals: a methine at d 67.8 and a methylene at d 64.4; three signals for methines at d 40.1, 38.4 and 36.5; one aliphatic methylene at d 24.6 and three signals for methyl groups: d 16.7, 15.9 and 10.8. The above data suggested a cadinane skeleton (Zhang et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 1996). The total attribution for the observed signals was accomplished based on gHMQC correlations. Additional gHMBC correlations of H-5 (d 6.87) with C- 15 and C-7 (d 15.9 and d 36.5, respectively) and H-2 (d 6.43) with C-10 and C-4 (d 40.1 and d 121.9) allowed us to fully determine the aromatic moiety. The phenolic func- tion linked at C-3, was supported by the correlations between H-15 (d 2.05) and C-3/C-5 (d 152.9 and d 128.1, respectively). The linkage of the p-menthane moiety was determined through the correlations shown by C-1 (d 141.1) with H-14/H-9 (d 1.03/d 3.76) and C-6 (d 127.4) with, H-11/H-8b (d 2.70/d 1.52). Observed correlations between C-12 ! H-7 (d 64.4/3.04) and H-13 ! C-7 (d 0.51/36.5) allowed us to fully determine the calamenene skeleton (Nagashima et al., 1996). gNOESY was useful to establish the relative conﬁgura- tion of the stereocenters for 1. A correlations between Me-14 and Me-13 conﬁrmed a cis-calamenene, according to reported literature (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993). Further observed corre- lations between H-9a and H-7 allowed us to conﬁrm a (cis)-1,3-pseudo-diaxial relationship between these centers (Nabeta et al., 1993). We were not able to determine the conﬁguration of the stereocenter at C-11, due to free rotation of this center with C-7–C-11 bond. Compound 1 was thus identiﬁed as the rel. ()-(7S,9S,10S)-3,9,12- trihydroxycalamenene. Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H22O3 ([M + HH2O]+) at m/z 233.1542. The obtained mass and similarities observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) indicated that 2 was a diastereoisomer of 1. The main spectroscopic diﬀerences observed for this molecule were elucidated by using gNOESY. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 indicated that both groups remained in a cis conformation. The appearance of a strong correlation of Me-14 and H-9 indicated that H-7 and H-9 were in a trans conformation.

Assignments were aided by 1H–1H gCOSY and gHMQC. G.H. Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 1964–1969 1965 et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993) allowed us to provisionally deduce identify 2 as rel. (+)-(7S,9R,10S) the C-9 diastereo- isomer of 1. Compound 3 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. HRESI mass data allowed us to propose the molecular formula C15H22O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 235.1777). The absence of an oxygen atom in this molecule allowed us to provisionally deduce that a reduction occurred at position C-9. This reduction was conﬁrmed by 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) due to the presence of the signal at d 28.5 and the lack of the carboxymethine signal at d 67.8/69.1 present in 1 and 2, respectively. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 was observed in the gNOESY experiment thus concluding that 3 has a cis calamenene relative stereochemistry. Observed correla- tions between H-9a and H-8a and H-7 deﬁned their relative conﬁguration also as cis. Further observed correlations between H-8b and H-9b, conﬁrmed the relative conﬁgura- tion established for the p-menthane moiety. Compound 3 was hence identiﬁed as the rel. (+)-(7S,10S) 3,12- dihydroxycalamenene. Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. A molecular formula C15H18O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 231.1405) was obtained after HRESI mass data analysis. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed a new aromatic hydrogen spin system at d 7.03 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) and d 6.93 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) with an ortho conﬁguration. The downﬁeld shift observed for Me-14 (Dd +1.3) was indic- ative of an aromatization of the p-menthane moiety (Nab- eta et al., 1994). 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) data showed 10 aromatic carbons, three methyls: two benzylic and one aliphatic; one carboxymethylene and one benzylic methine, indicative of the presence of a naphthalene skele- ton. All correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and compared with reported data for cadalene analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Further correlations observed in the gHMBC experi- ment, particularly the ones of H-8 (d 6.93) with C-6/C-11 and H-9 (d 7.03) with C-1/C-14 allowed us to fully deter- mine the substitution pattern of the B ring for the naphtha- lene moiety. Compound 4 was identiﬁed as 3,12- dihydroxycadalene. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H18O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 269.1179). The appearance of a hydroxyl group in 5 was corroborated by the loss of the signal assigned to H-11 (d 3.59) in 4 thus suggesting that oxidation had occurred at this position. 13C NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopic data corroborated this assump- tion showing a signal at d 75.3 (s) which exhibited a corre- lation showed in the gHMBC experiment with H-8 (d 7.21) indicating that the new oxidized position was at C-11. Other correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, and compared with reported data for analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Compound 5 was identiﬁed as the new 3,11,12- trihydroxycadalene. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–5 against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaero- spermum was evaluated by bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). The compound 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (2) exhibited potent activity against two fungi. The detection limit for the compound 5 was found to be 1.0 lg, compara- ble with the same amount of the standard nystatin. Cytotoxicity of the compounds 1–5 against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983).

Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC50 5 lmol L1. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure Optical rotations were determined at room temperature using Perkin–Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin–Elmer 1710 spectrometer and Perkin–Elmer UV–Vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on Microquimica MQAPF-301. 1H and 13C NMR spectra; gHMBC and gHMQC, gCOSY and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive and nega- tive ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-reso- lution orthogonal time of ﬂight (o-TOF) conﬁguration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 ll/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH–H2O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using a ESI capil- lary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/ MS spectra of mass selected ions were acquired using 10– 20 eV collisions with argon. For preparative HPLC separa- tions, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, and a Phe- nyl-hexyl Luna Phenomenex column, (250 · 21.20 mm, 5 lm), were used in this study. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromato-integrator connected to a UV detector. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisal- dehyde 5% in H2SO4 followed by heating. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated C. spectabilis plant material was collected in the Chemistry Institute UNESP – Araraquara, SP, Bra- zil in June 17, 2001 by G.H. Silva. The botanical identiﬁca- tion was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SILVA – 193). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus The fungal strain P. cassiae was an endophyte isolated from leaves of C. spectabilis. The leaves were washed in running H2O and surface sterilized by successive soaking in NaOCl 1% for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 1 min and then rinsed twice with water. Aseptically the leaves were cut open and 1 · 1 cm2 pieces of the leaves were placed on water agar in Petri plates. After incubation at 25 C for seven days, individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maier et al., 1997). During the ﬁrst three weeks of incubation, the cultures were periodically checked for purity and successively subcultured by hyphal tipping method until pure culture was obtained. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar. The taxonomic iden- tiﬁcation as P. cassiae was performed based on fungal morphology by Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited Cole- c¸a˜o Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lav- ras fungal herbarium and assigned as CML 292. 3.4. Growth of P. cassiae and production of the EtOAc extract The fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlen- meyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 C for 15 min. Approxi- mately 10 small pieces (1 · 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the P. cassiae isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration. The culture broth was extracted with EtOAc (3 · 2,0 L). The EtOAc extracts were combined, ﬁltered, and evaporated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (277.12 mg). 3.5. Antifungal assay The microorganisms C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Com- pounds 1–5 were applied on a precoated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 lL) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 lg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control. 3.6. Cytotoxicity bioassays The human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described (Mosmann, 1983). Cisplatin was used as positive control (IC50 5.0 lmol L1). 3.7. Extraction and isolation The extract was subjected to C18 column chromatogra- phy employing gradient elution from H2O to MeOH, to yield 7 fractions (H2O:MeOH, 85:15, 65:35, 60:40, 55:45, 45:55, 35:65, 00:100 each 150 mL). 1H NMR spectro- scopic analyses identiﬁed fractions 3, 4 and 5 as promising G.H. Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 1964–1969 1967 for further fractionation. The fraction 3 (23.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 · 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (19:81) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpene 1 (3.5 mg). Fraction 4 (15.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 · 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (22:78) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/ min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpenes 2 (2.5 mg) and 4 (4.0 mg). Fraction 5 (30.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phe- nomenex 21.20 · 250 mm] using CH3CN:H2O (29:71) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpenes 3 (4.0 mg) and 5 (4.8 mg). 3.7.1.

The structures of the isolated lignans were elucidated by interpretation of their spectroscopic data, including by gHMQC and gHMBC. The relative and abso- lute conﬁgurations of the isolates were determined from NOESY interactions and optical properties, respectively. Four of the lignans were diastereomeric whilst one was of mixed biosynthetic origin. All but one of the lignans exhibited high in vitro trypanocidal activity when assayed against epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction Chagas disease is one of the most widespread of tropical diseases, being endemic in 21 countries, with some 16–18 million individuals infected and a further 100 million peo- ple at risk (Molfetta et al., 2005; Pozas et al., 2005). Signiﬁcant antiprotozoal activities have recently been reported for a number of lignans derived from members of the Piperaceae family (Martins et al., 2003; Luize et al., 2006). This family, which is included among the basal angiosperms and can be found in the tropics mainly as pio- neer plants, has been the subject of numerous phytochem- ical investigations. The major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Par- mar et al., 1997; Benevides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Ale´cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (More- ira et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005). Piper and Peperomia represent the most important gen- era of the Piperaceae family with 2000 (Wanke et al., 2006) and 1700 species (Quijano-Abril et al., 2006), respectively. Species of Peperomia are well known as ornamental plants and have found application in folk medicine for the treat- ment of inﬂammation, asthma and gastric ulcers, and as analgesic and antibacterial agents (Arrigon-Blank et al., 2004). The major classes of compounds present in the rela- tively few species of Peperomia that have been investigated are prenylated phenols and benzoic acids (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Seeram et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998; Salazar et al., 2005), and also dibenzylbutyro- lactone and dibenzylbutanediol lignans (Li et al., 2006). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently, two new tetrahydrofuran lignans were isolated from Peper- omia pellucida (Xu et al., 2006) and thus a phenylpropa- noid-based lineage for the Peperomia species can be supported. Peperomia blanda H.B. & K. is a perennial herb that typ- ically grows in wet rock crevices (Guimara˜es and Giord- ano, 2004). At the present time, information is only available concerning the essential oil (Santos et al., 2001) and two chromenes isolated from the non-polar fraction of the aerial parts of the species (Velozo et al., 2006). In the present work, we report the isolation and structural elu- cidation of four new tetrahydrofuran lignan stereoisomers and a new tetrahydrofuran lignan of mixed biosynthetic origin. The antitripanosomal properties of these novel lign- ans have been determined. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract derived from aerial parts of P. blan- da was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 was fractionated chromatographically to yield ﬁve lignans 1–5; (Fig. 1) and two ﬂavones (6 and 7). The 1H NMR spectra of compounds 1–4 were characteristic of non-symmetric tetrahydrofuran lignans since each exhibited a pair of doublets at d 0.63 ± 0.05 (CH3-9) and 1.04 ± 0.04 (CH3-90) corresponding to methyl groups, a second set of doublets at d 5.03 ± 0.02 (H-7) and 4.32 ± 0.03 (H-70) that were assignable to oxybenzyl methine groups, and multiplets at d 2.18 ± 0.03 and 1.69 ± 0.03 associated, respectively, with the H8 and H80 protons. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data corroborated the presence of the tetrahydrofuran system in each case, and all signals were assigned accordingly based on HMBC data (Tables 1 and 2). As previously reported (Biftu and Stevenson, 1987; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989), the coupling constants of 8.5 and 9.0 Hz for the doublet at d 5.05, and of 4.33 Hz for H-7 and H-70 indicate that these hydrogens are in a trans conﬁguration with the adjacent H-8 and H-80 in a tetrahy- drofuran ring. Diﬀerential NOE experiments (Fig. 2) con- ﬁrmed the relative stereochemistry of all of the lignans isolated. Thus, as for lignan 3, H-7 showed clear NOE cor- relations with H-70 and H-8, H-70 correlated with H-7, H-8 and H-90, and H-80 correlated with H-9 conﬁrming the trans conﬁguration of the adjacent H-8 and H-80 and a cis conﬁguration between H-7 and H-70. The diﬀerences observed in the NMR spectra of com- pounds 1–4 were due to diﬀerent substitution patterns in the aromatic ring. The molecular formula of lignan 1 was established as C22H26O7 by HRMS. The aromatic moieties were determined to be syringyl and 5-methoxy-3,4-methy- lenedioxyphenyl groups on the following basis: (i) two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at d 6.49 (s, 2H) correlated to H7 in the HMBC spectrum, (ii) aromatic carbons C3 and C5 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.80) and to H2/H6, and (iii) the second aromatic ring was not symmet- rical and displayed two singlets at d 6.61 (H20) and 6.64 (H60), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-40 and C-70 in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, 1 was established as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-4-hydroxy-40,50-methylenedioxy-3,5,30- trimethoxy-7,70-epoxylignan. Compound 2 showed a molecular formula of C23H28O7 by HRMS. 1H NMR spectra indicated two equivalent aro- matic hydrogens at d 6.48 (s, 2H) correlating to H7 in the HMBC spectrum and aromatic carbons C3, C5 at d 152.8 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.77) and to H2/H6 and subsequently, C4 at d 136.6 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.76). The second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at d 6.61 (H20) and 6.64 (H60), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-40 and C-70 in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, 2 was identiﬁed as rel- (7R,8S,70S,80S)-40,50-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,30-tetrameth- oxy-7,70-epoxylignan, i.e., a methylated derivative of 1. The molecular formula of 3 was determined to be C23H30O7 by HRMS, and the aromatic moieties were iden- tiﬁed as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimeth- oxyphenyl groups. The aromatic singlets at d 6.49 and 6.67 were assigned to separate aromatic groups, since the HMBC showed correlation to H7 (d 5.03) and H70 (d 4.34), respectively. The remaining correlations between C3/C30, C4/C40 and C5/C50 perfectly matched those of H2/H20and H6/H60. Thus compound 3 was determined as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-40-hydroxy-3,4,5,30,50-pentameth- oxy-7,70-epoxylignan. Compound 4 showed the molecular formula C22H24O7 by HRMS, and both aromatic moieties were identiﬁed as 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups for the sig- nals at d 5.97 (s, 2H) and d 5.96 (s, 2H) due to methylenedi- oxyphenyl groups connected to C4/C5 and C40/C50, respectively. At d 3.93 (s, 3H) and d 3.90 (s, 3H) are the res- onances of two methoxyl groups correlated to C3 and C30.

Tetrahydrofuran lignans isolated from the aerial parts of Peper- omia blanda. 446 L.G. Felippe et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 445–450 The identity of 4 was thus established as rel- (7R,8S,70S,80S)-4,5,40,50-dimethylenedioxy-3,30-dimethoxy- 7,70-epoxylignan. The molecular formula of 5 was established as C23H28O8 by HRMS. The compound diﬀered from lignans 1–4 in respect to a hydroxyl group linked to C-9. The presence of this group was deduced from various sources: the IR spectrum (absorption at 3450 cm1), from the 1H NMR by signals at d 3.40 (2H, m), from the 13C NMR both from resonances at d 62.5 and the presence of only one methyl group (d 1.08; d, J = 7.0 Hz), and from the HMBC, which showed connectivity between the H9 protons and C7. Thus, 5 was determined as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-9-hydroxy- 40,50-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,30-tetramethoxy-7,70- epoxylignan. The known ﬂavones 5-hydroxy-40,7,8-trimethoxyﬂavone (6) and 5-hydroxy-30,40,7,8-tetramethoxyﬂavone (7) were also identiﬁed in the extract derived from the aerial parts of P. blanda. These compounds have been previously iso- lated from Peperomia sui (Cheng et al., 2003). Compounds 1–5 were submitted to bioassay against epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y and the respective IC50 values are shown in Table 3. All of the lign- ans exhibited potent trypanocidal activity.

Concluding remarks In this work, we describe the isolation and structural elucidation of ﬁve new tetrahydrofuran lignans from the aerial part of P. blanda. The trypanocidal activity of these compounds was evaluated against epimastigotes of T. cruzi strain Y. All of the isolates showed potent activity when compared with the positive control benznidazole. 3. Experimental 3.1. General 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HREIMS were measured using a Bruker Daltronics model ultrO- TOFQ ESI-TOF instrument. HPLC separations were per- formed on a Varian PrepStar model SD-1 LC/UV/VIS chromatograph equipped with a Supelcosil C-18 reversed phase column (250 · 21.2 mm; Supelco). IR spectra were measured in KBr pellets in a Perkin–Elmer Infrared spec- trometer FTIR series 1600. Optical rotations were mea- sured at k = 589 nm in a digital polarimeter JASCO model DIP-370. UV spectra were recorded in MeOH using a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer. Separations by CC were carried out using silica gel (230–400 mesh; Merck). All sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 3.2. Plant material The aerial parts of P. blanda were collected at the Res- erva da Ripasa, Ibate´ – SP, Brazil in January of 2005 and identiﬁed by Dra. Elsie Franklin Guimara˜es. A vou- cher specimen (Kato-547) has been deposited at the Her- barium of the Instituto de Biocieˆncias, Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo – SP, Brazil. 3.3. Isolation of compounds Dried aerial parts (86 g) of P. blanda were milled, extracted with EtOAc (1.2 L) for 4 hours at room temper- ature, and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude extract (8.5 g). This extract was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 (1.95 g) was submitted to CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane–EtOAc to yield fractions 1-14. The precipitate pres- ent in fraction 3 (420 mg) was puriﬁed by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound 6 (6.3 mg), whilst the soluble part was submitted to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane–EtOAc producing subfractions 3-1 to 3- 60. Subfractions 3-20 (12 mg) and 3-43 (46 mg) aﬀorded compounds 4 and 2, respectively. Fraction 4 (220 mg) was submitted to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gra- dient of hexane–EtOAc providing subfractions 4-1 to 4-37. Subfraction 4-23 (98 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (72:28) to aﬀord compound 1 (8.6 mg). The precipitate present in fraction 6 (103 mg) was puriﬁed by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield com- pound 7 (8.0 mg). Fraction 7 (350 mg) was subjected to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane– EtOAc resulting in subfractions 7-1 to 7-167. Subfraction 7-140 aﬀorded compound 5 (7 mg). Subfraction 7-79 (95.0 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (2:3) to yield ﬁve fractions, the penultimate of which aﬀorded compound 3 (17 mg). 3.4. rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-4-Hydroxy-40,50-methylenedioxy- 3,5,30-trimethoxy-7,70-epoxylignan (1) Pale yellow oil, ½a21 D 52.8 (MeOH; c 0.125).

In vitro bioassays The biological assays with epimastigote forms of T. cru- zi strain Y were performed as described previously (Ber- nacchi et al., 2002). Tetrahydrofuran lignans and benznidazole (Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were stored as 1.0 mg ml1 stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and were serially diluted (1:3) prior to use with liver-infusion tryptose (LIT) medium to provide concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 lg ml1, each in triplicate. The number of viable pro- tozoa was determined by counting in a Neubauer chamber after 72 h incubation at 28 C. The 50% inhibitory concen- tration (IC50) values were calculated by ﬁtting a nonlinear regression curve (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) and comparing with those of benznidazole, the positive control. A one-way ANOVA test was used to establish the signiﬁcance level of the activity corresponding to each compound evaluated in the in vitro assay.

The structures of all compounds were elucidated primarily from 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All ﬂavonols were screened to identify secondary metabolites as potential myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitors, and at concentrations of 0.50–50 nM, quer- cetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) exhibited strong inhibitory eﬀects with IC50 values of 1.22 ± 0.01, 3.75 ± 0.02 and 3.60 ± 0.02, respectively. The MPO activity detected for the new derivative 1 was markedly decreased (IC50 10.3 ± 0.03) when compared with known ﬂavonols 5–7, and interestingly increased when tested against ABTS scavenging activity. 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Keywords: Pterogyne nitens; Fabaceae; Acylated ﬂavonol; Myeloperoxidase; Antioxidant 1. Introduction Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-enzyme present in human neutrophils and plays a role in infection and inﬂam- mation, converting hydrogen peroxide and chloride to hypochlorous acid and water (Winterbourn et al., 2000). Although hypochlorous acid has important roles in killing microorganisms, it also possesses high reactivity and the ability to damage macromolecules by oxidation (Teixeira et al., 2003). The excessive MPO activity and reactive oxy- gen species (ROS), especially HOCl, production are impli- cated in many inﬂammatory processes (Heinecke et al., 1993; Gurel et al., 2004), including atherosclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease; the search for new myeloperoxi- dase inhibitors from natural sources has become a staple in drug discovery. Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae) is popularly named in Bra- zil as ‘‘tipa´”, ‘‘viraro´”, ‘‘cocal”, ‘‘amendoinzeiro”, ‘‘amen- doim-bravo”, according to the region where this plant grows. It is a beautiful legume tree, and the sole member of the genus Pterogyne, which is distributed mainly in Bra- zil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, and can reach a height of 5–12 m. (Burkart, 1952). Its wood is also widely 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.01.006 * Corresponding author. Tel.: +55 16 33016660; fax: +55 16 33227932.

Our previous studies on P. nitens have resulted in the isolation of ﬂavones, and ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited selective activity towards a DNA repair-deﬁcient strain of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting poten- tial anti-cancer activity (Bolzani et al., 1995). In our contin- uing interest in searching for new biologically active metabolites from plants of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest regions, we have investigated the fruits of this plant, col- lected at the Botanical Garden, Sa˜o Paulo, in May 2003. We report herein the isolation, and structural elucidation of one new ﬂavonol rhamnoside, namely pterogynoside (1) and six known ﬂavonols: kaempferol (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (Pizzolat- ti et al., 2003), quercetin, isoquercitrin and rutin (Markham et al., 1978). Additionally, these compounds were screened for MPO inhibitory activity, using a guaiacol oxidation method (Capeille`re-Blandin, 1998). The new ﬂavonol 1 was also analyzed for the scavenging of DPPH and ABTS free radicals activities and its antioxidant potential was evaluated (see Fig. 1). 2. Results and discussion Shade-dried, powdered fruits of P. nitens were ﬁrst defatted with n-hexane and exhaustively extracted by re- maceration with ethanol. The solvent was evaporated at low temperature under reduced pressure to yield a syrup which was suspended in methanol–water (4:1) and then successively partitioned with ethyl acetate and n-butyl alco- hol. The resulting fractions were subjected to successive column chromatography separation steps to yield ptero- gynoside (1) along with six known ﬂavonols. Pterogynoside (1) was isolated as yellow prisms, m.p. 272–273 C, and gave a positive reaction with ferric chlo- ride, indicating it as a phenol derivative. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydro- xyl (3280 cm1), chelated hydroxy group (3265 cm1), con- jugated ester (1695 cm1), conjugated ketone (1650 cm1) and aromatic C@C absorptions (1612, 1593, 1550 and 1508 cm1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions (kmax) (loge) at 316 (4.53) and 297 (4.29), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a ﬂavonol struc- ture (Mabry et al., 1970; Agrawal et al., 1989). The UV spectra recorded in EtOH and shift reagents such as KOH, NaOAc and AlCl3 suggested the presence of free hydroxy groups at C-40, C-7 and C-5, respectively. Its ele- mental composition C29H26O14, with 17 of unsaturation, was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deproto- nated molecular ion ([MH]) at m/z 597.5087 (calcd for C29H26O14, 597.5081) consistent with its 13C NMR data (Table 1, Supporting Information). The CID (collision induced dissociation) experiments using the product ion scan mode (MS2) allowed characterization and establish- ment of the fragmentation pathway of pterogynoside, with an intense (64%) kaempferol peak at m/z 285 in the nega- tive ion mode. The positive ion mode also gave an intense kaempferol peak at m/z 287. Further MS analysis showed a deprotonated ion peak at m/z 597, and a product ion at m/z 431 indicating the presence of one hexose residue in com- pound 1.

Regasini et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 1739–1744 denced the presence of a 5,7,400- trisubstituted ﬂavonol moi- ety, in addition to 4000-methylgallate and a-L-rhamnopyr- anosyl residues. The assignment of all proton and carbon signals followed from extensive analysis of 1H–1H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC spectra (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 presented 29 carbons deduced from DEPT 90, DEPT 135 and gHMQC techniques as one methyl, thirteen methines, one methoxyl and fourteen quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 167.7 and d 179.5, attributed to ester and ketone groups, respectively. The 1H NMR and 1H–1H gCOSY spectra (Table 1) showed an A2M2 spin system assigned to the hydrogen sig- nals at d 7.74 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-200, 60) and 6.87 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-30, 50) attributed to a 1,4-disubstituted aro- matic ring; and a pair of doublets at d 6.10 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6) and 6.29 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-8) for the trioxygenated A ring of compound 1, suggesting a kaempferol moiety for its aglycone. Additionally, the 1H NMR resonances at d 5.38 and 0.89 evidenced an a- rhamnopyranosyl moiety, which was conﬁrmed by obser- vation of correlated signals at d 103.6, d and d 17.7 in the HMQC spectrum. A cross-peak between the signals for C-3 (d136.0) and the anomeric hydrogen H-100 (d 5.38) in the gHMBC spectrum indicated the position of the rhamnosyl unit at C-3 of the kaempferol moiety. Further analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) indicated an additional methylgallate unit in compound 1, which was placed at C-300 of the rhamnopyranosyl moi- ety due to the downﬁeld chemical shift observed for H-300 (d 5.11), and a gHMBC cross-peak of H-300 with the car- bonyl ester C-7000 (d 167.7). An additional gHMBC correla- tion was observed between the signal at d 141.2 (C-4000) and d 3.77 (OMe) which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-4000. Hence, the structure of pterogynoside (1) was completely elucidated, and established as kaempfer- ol-3-O-(300-O-4000-methylgallate-a-L-rhamnoside. Addition- ally, six known ﬂavonols were isolated and identiﬁed as kaempferol (2) (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (3) (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (4) (Pizzolatti et al., 2003), quer- cetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) (Markham et al., 1978). Their identiﬁcation was based on analyses of 1H, 13C NMR and MS data, as well as by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory. Furthermore, this is the ﬁrst report of ﬂavonol glycosides from P. nitens. Although a broad spectrum of biological activities has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids (Middleton et al., 2000; Cuzzocrea et al., 2001; Havsteen, 2002; Mol- lace et al., 2005), few studies have been devoted to the mye- loperoxidase inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols (Kato et al., 2003). Myeloperoxidase production is triggered by inﬂamma- tory mediators resulting in acceleration of superoxide anion (O 2 ) conversion to hydrogen peroxide an other ROS especially HOCl, which reacts further to generate sin- glet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (HO) as powerful oxidizing agents. Such species are involved in oxidative stress-related diseases as atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer disease etc., which evidences the importance of research towards new MPO inhibitors. All isolates were assayed for their MPO inhibitory activ- ity (Table 2), evidencing a key role of the B ring oxygena- tion pattern on the level of activity. Compounds 5–7, presenting a catechol derived B-ring, exhibited IC50 values of 1.22, 3.75 and 3.60 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1–4, which are kaempferol derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. The aglycone quercetin (5) was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003) and presented higher activity than its glucosides isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7), suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-3 for enhancement of the MPO inhibitory activity. This trend has also been observed for kaempferol derivatives 1–4, as the glucosides pterogynoside (1), afzelin (3) and kaempferi- trin (4) exhibited IC50 values of 10.3, 13.9 and 15.8 nM, respectively, and were less active than the aglycone kaempferol (2, IC50 8.3 nM). These results indicate a clear positive correlation between MPO inhibitory activity and antioxidant properties of ﬂavonoids as shown in Table 2. The catechol on B ring and the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moieties have been extensively pointed out as the main fea- tures in ﬂavonoids associated with enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant activity (Van Acker et al., 1996). The presence of a galloyl group, e.g. in ﬂavonoids, has also been associ- ated with increased antioxidant capacity (Heijnen et al., 2002). In this respect, the presence of an additional galloyl unit in compound 1 might explain its higher MPO inhibi- tory activity, when compared with compounds 3 and 4. The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging eﬀects using two diﬀerent assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay. Quercetin derivatives 5–7 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with values of IC50 (lg/mL) of 4.12, 4.37 and 4.85, and DPPH with values of 2.60, 2.77 and 3.15, respectively, than kaempferol derivatives 1–4 (Table 2), indicating a major role of the catechol moiety on the B-ring Table 2 Myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory activity and free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) towards ABTS and DPPH of ﬂavonols 1-7 Compound MPO inhibition IC50 (nM)a Free radical scavenging activity ABTS IC50 (lg/mL)a DPPH IC50 (lg/mL)a Pterogynoside (1) 10.3 ± 0.03 8.10 ± 0.1 >80.0 Kaempferol (2) 8.30 ± 0.03 18.0 ± 0.5 17.8 ± 0.8 Afzelin (3) 13.9 ± 0.04 17.0 ± 0.7 >80.0 Kaempferitrin (4) 15.8 ± 0.05 18.5 ± 0.2 55.8 ± 0.8 Quercetin (5)b 1.22 ± 0.01 4.12 ± 0.2 2.60 ± 0.1 Isoquercitrin (6) 3.75 ± 0.02 4.37 ± 0.2 2.77 ± 0.4 Rutin (7) 3.60 ± 0.02 4.85 ± 0.2 3.15 ± 0.3 Trolox – 0.63 ± 0.3 4.72 ± 0.4 a IC50 values were determined by regression linear and expressed as means ± SD of tree replicates. b Quercetin was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003).

Additionally, among compounds 1–4, increas- ing activities were observed for pterogynoside (1) and kaempferol (2), which conﬁrms the importance of the free hydroxyl groups on C-3 (in 2) and the enhancement of RSA due to the galloyl group (in 1) in both assays. Among compounds 5–7, quercetin (5) exhibited higher activity than its 3-O-glucosyl derivatives 6 and 7, which conﬁrmed the inﬂuence of the free-hydroxy group at C-3 for potenti- ating the free radical scavenging activity of ﬂavonoids. 3. Concluding remarks In summary, ﬂavonoids with either the catechol moiety or a,b-unsaturated carbonyl with the free hydroxyl group at C-3 have shown best anti-radicalar and MPO inhibitory properties, which corroborates the involvement of MPO in redox processes. The absence of such features in ptero- gynoside (1) has been counteracted by the galloyl moiety on C-300 leading to MPO inhibitory activity comparable to kaempferol (2), and higher free radical scavenging abil- ity than 2 or its glucosides 3 and 4. Flavonols from P. nitens presented potent inhibition towards the pro-oxidant and pro-inﬂammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase and potent radical scavenging eﬀects, which may be particularly important because they are eas- ily available in the plant kingdom (Middleton et al., 2000) and are able to protect biological systems against stress phenomena such as lipid peroxidation, as shown for a vari- ety of kaempferol derivatives exhibiting high antioxidant selectivity (Gebre-Mariam et al., 2005), and for quercetin and its derivatives, which have been shown to protect cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and calcium dysreg- ulation (Wang and Joseph, 1999). 4. Experimental 4.1. General methods Melting points were recorded on a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melting point apparatus. The 1D – (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D – (1H – 1H gCOSY, gHMQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 126 MHz (13C), using the solvents as an internal standard. Negative-ion high resolution mass spectra were recorded on HRMS ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF instrument (Bruker Dal- tonics). IR spectra absorptions were measured on a Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr discs, whereas UV spectra were acquired on a Perkin Elmer UV–vis Lambda 14P spectrophotometer. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and pre- coated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde- hyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Pre- parative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden. All enzymatic or scavenging free radical assays were performed using a Spectrophotom- eter HP 8543, Diode Array. Guaiacol, ABTS [2,20-azin- obis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were purchased from Sigma Chemical. All other reagents were analytical grade and commercially available. MPO was purchased from Planta Natural Products. 4.2. Plant material Fruits of P. nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A vou- cher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the her- barium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil). 4.3. Extraction and isolation The shade-dried fruits (2 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (15 L 5, at room tempera- ture, for two weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macer- ation with EtOH (25 L 5) at room temperature. The combined ethanol extracts were concentrated in vacuo (< 40 C) to yield 8.0 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH:H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.5 and 3.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue was subjected to silica gel (230–400 mesh) CC eluted with EtOAc/MeOH gradient (0–100% MeOH) to aﬀord eight fractions (E1–E8) and free agly- cones 2 (220.9 mg) and 5 (150.8 mg). Fraction E6 (397.8 mg) was further puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH:- H2O:AcOH (58:42:0.1), UV detection at 254 nm; ﬂow rate 10 mL/min], aﬀording acylated ﬂavonol 1 (115.9 mg) and two ﬂavonol monoglycosides 3 (82.9 mg) and 6 (78.7 mg). The n-BuoH residue was dissolved into MeOH and sub- mitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, aﬀording 23 fractions (B1–B23). After TLC com- parison, fractions B12–B19 were combined (488.3 mg) and puriﬁed by RP-HPLC using MeOH:H2O:AcOH (68:32:0.1) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 254 nm and ﬂow rate of 12 mL/min, aﬀording ﬂavonol diglycosides 4 (150.7 mg) and 7 (299.0 mg). 4.4.

ESIMSMS spectra showed [M+H]+ and [MH] peaks at m/z 599 and m/z 597, respectively. ESIMSMS gave product ion from [M+H]+ at m/z 287 (C15H10O6, kaempferol)+. ESIMSMS product ions from [MH] were observed at m/z 431 (MH–4000-O-methyl- gallate) (C21H20O10), m/z 285 (C15H10O6, kaempferol). HRESIMS (negative ion mode) (m/z) 597.5087; (MH, calcd for C29H26O14: 597.5079). For 1H NMR (500 MHz, CD3OD) and 13C NMR (126 MHz, CD3OD) spectroscopic data, see Table 1. 4.5. Assay for MPO inhibitory activity MPO inhibitory eﬀects of ﬂavonols 1–7 were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM). The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calcu- lated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at diﬀerent sample concentrations of compounds 1–7 (0.50–50 nM) and in the their absence (Kato et al., 2003). The IC50 values were calculated from the rates calculated on the basis of inhibition percentage expressed in concentration–response curves. 4.6. Evaluation of radical scavenging activity (RSA) Radical scavenging activity (RSA) of compounds 1–7 was determined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS+ [2,20-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sul- fonic acid)] as reagents. Sample solutions of 1–7 and Trolox at various concentrations (10–100 lg/ml) in EtOH were indi- vidually added to 0.6 mM DPPH in EtOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 C for 30 min (Soares et al., 1997; Duarte-Almeida et al., 2006). Remaining DPPH was deter- mined colorimetrically at 531 nm by blanking against abso- lute ethanol. ABTS+ was prepared by reacting 5 mL of ABTS (7 mM) water soln. with 88 lL of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12–16 h before use. Prior to assay ABTS+ stock soln. was diluted with KH2PO4/ K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buﬀer soln. (ratio 1:88). One milliliter ABTS+ was added to glass test tubes containing diﬀerent concentrations of compound 1 and Trolox (0.5–7.0 lg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging activity (Pellegrini et al., 1999). Anti-radical abilities against ABTS+ and DPPH species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (inhibition%) calculated from the equation: Inhibi- tion % = [1 (Asample/A) 100], where A is test absorbance without sample (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with compounds 1–7 or Trolox.

Introduction Fungal endophytes comprise a wide range of fungi character- ized by the ability to live for a certain period of their life-cycles internally and asymptomatically in plants (Wang et al., 2007). Such co-existence may confer adaptative advantages to the plant host, such as feeding deterrence, protection against insects and microbial pathogens (De Souza et al., 2004). Considering that chemical clues are usually involved in these biological interactions, natural products from endophytic fungi very often present a broad spectrum of biological activities (Zhang et al., 2006). Isocoumarins are metabolites of limited distribution, which occur in bacteria, fungi and lichen (Kutschera et al., 2003). These compounds have also been detected in secretions of termites and ants (Engelmeier et al., 2004). Several biological activities have been reported for this class, including cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antiallergic, algicidal, gastroprotective, protease inhibitory, anti- fungal (O¨ zcan et al., 2007; Krohn et al., 1997; Guimara˜es et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009) as well as plant growth regulators (Kuramata et al., 2007). The Brazilian cerrado trees are well known sources of bioactive secondary metabolites (Bolzani et al., 1991; Young et al., 1992; Silva et al., 2007, 2010). Among these, A. macrophylla K. Schum (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were chosen for a detailed microbiological investigation. These plants presented several endophytes, including Penicillium and Xylaria species, which were submitted to chemical and biological investigations. Herein, we report the isolation and biological activities of one new dihydroisocoumarin, (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6-dihydroxy-3- methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid (1) and two known dihydroisocoumarins, (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Fig. 1). 2. Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as yellow amorphous powder, and showed a positive reaction with ferric chloride suggesting the presence of a phenol functionality. The IR spectrum of 1 showed strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (3474 cm1) and a conjugated carbonyl group (1672 cm1). The UV spectrum of 1 displayed absorptions (lmax) (log e) at 220 (4.28) and 314 (3.34), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a dihydroisocoumarin structure (Pontius et al., 2008). Its elemental composition C11H10O6 with seven degrees of insaturation was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([MH]) at m/z 237.0381 (calcd for C11H9O6, 237.0399), consistent with its 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.phytol.2010.11.003 gHMBC NMR experiments enabled us to assign all 1H and 13C signals. The 13C NMR, DEPT 908, and 1H–13C gHMQC indicated that compound 1 had one methyl, four methines, and six quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 169.5 and d 167.1, assigned toa carboxyl and toad-lactonegroups, respectively.The 1H NMR and 1H–1H gCOSY spectra of 1 showed two ortho-coupled hydrogens at d 7.04 (H-8) and d 8.10 (H-9), suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 1H–1H gCOSY spectrum indicated a spin system in 1 which included a methyl group atd 1.43 (H3C-10) coupled with an oxymethine hydrogen at d 4.72 (H-3), itselfcoupledwithamethinehydrogenatd5.47(H-4).Therefore,the aliphatic portion of 1 was unambiguously established as a H3C– CH(O–)–CH–OH chain. Long-range correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum between H-7 (d 7.04) with C-6 (d 163.9), C-5 (d 108.7), and C-8a (d 120.0), between H-4 (d 5.47) with C-4a (d 144.8), C-5, C-8a and C-3 (d 78.2), as well as between H-8 (d 8.10) with C-6, C-1 (d 167.1) and C-4a enabled us to establish unequivocally the substitution pattern of the aromatic moiety of 1. A logical deduction ofthe datacollectedwouldobviouslyleadtothe structure1.SinceH- 3 and H-4 showed a coupling constant of 1.8 Hz, these protons had an axial–equatorial relationship. Thus, the relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was established as (3R*, 4R*). This relative conﬁguration at C-3 and C-4 was very similar when compared with data of similar isochromanes (Okuno et al., 1986; Aldridge et al., 1971). A comparison of the optical rotation of 1 ([a]D 28 60.3, c 0.034, MeOH)withthe literature values reportedfor three of the four possible 4-hydroxymellein stereoisomers (Devys et al., 1980) indicated that (3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-mellein has both the signal and magnitude of optical rotation ([a]D 1.5) comparable to compound 1. Therefore, the absolute conﬁguration of 1 was assigned as (3R,4R) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Hence, the structure of compound 1 was completely elucidated, and established as (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6- dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid. In addition, two known dihydroisocoumarins were isolated from a Penicillium sp. and identiﬁed as (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Compounds 2 and 3 were identiﬁed by analysis of spectroscopic data, as well as of optical rotation data, with literature values. Both 2 and 3 exhibited a rare 7,8-dihydroxy substitution. To date, related compounds have been isolated from plant and fungi sources, including Azadirachta indica, Septoria nodorum, Cytospora eucalypticola, Nodulisporum sp. and Cephalosporium sp. (Devys et al., 1980; Siddiqui et al., 1988; Kokubun et al., 2003; Bi et al., 2006; Pontius et al., 2008). The cathecol moiety of 2 and 3 is probably formed after an additional oxidation at C-7, subsequently to the formation of the aromatic polyketide skeleton. Dihydroisocoumarins 1–3 were evaluated for their antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladospor- ioides using direct bioautography assay (Table 1) (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds 2 and 3 showed a potent effect against the yeasts, exhibiting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 mg against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 1 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity towards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 mg, respectively. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydroisocoumarins and catechol moiety at C-7 and C-8. The identiﬁcation of the compounds 1–3, potentially bioactive against the phytopathogenic fungi, indicates that they act as defense of the host species against possible infection by pathogens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for metabolites from Penicillium and Xylaria genera, few studies have been devoted to the acetylcholin- esterase inhibitory activity of this class of pentaketides. Com- pounds 2 and 3 showed a limit of detection of 10 mg in a TLC-based AChE inhibition assay which was considered as weakly potent. Dihydroisocoumarin 1 displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 3.0 mg. In conclusion, three dihydrocoumarin derivatives, one new from Xylaria sp. and two known from Penicillium sp., associated with P. aduncum and A. macrophylla leaves, respectively, have been isolated and identiﬁed and exhibited antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results herein reported suggest that dihydrocoumarins should be considered as potential lead com- pounds in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for use in the drug design for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the non-deuterated residual signal as refer- ence. Mass spectra were measured on a LC–MS Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using the ESI mode and MeOH–H2O (1:1) as eluent (cone voltage 25 V). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde- hyde–H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 8C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C18 (250 mm 21.2 mm) preparative column. Ana- lytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 HPLC system using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm).

Optical rotations were measured with PerkinElmer polarimeter with sodium lamp operating at 589 nm at 28 8C. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated A. macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were collected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Ecolo´gica Experimental de Mogi-Guac¸u, Fazenda Campininha’’, Mogi-Guac¸u, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identiﬁcations were assigned by Dr. Ineˆs Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher no. SP 370915 and Cordeiro PAO, respectively). 3.3. Isolation and identiﬁcation of the endophytes Adult and healthy leaves of P. aduncum and A. macrophylla were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. Leaves were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and in 70% aqueous EtOH for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate (50 mg/mL), 3–4 pieces on each dish. The material of the two species was incubated at 25 8C for 10 days and the endophytes Penicillium sp. and Xylaria sp. were isolated by successive inoculation in Petri dishes from Alibertia macrophyla and P. aduncum, respectively (Silva et al., 2006). The fungus Penicillium sp. was identiﬁed by Dr. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quı´micas, Biolo´ gicas e Agrı´colas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number 05070032-C. The fungus Xylaria sp. was identiﬁed by Prof. Dr. Ludwing H. Pfenning (Universidade Federal de Lavras, Departamento de Fitopatologia) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number PA-01. 3.4. Growth of Xylaria sp. and extraction The strain was inoculated in twenty Erlenmeyers (500 mL each) containing each one: 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose (PDB) in 300 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved at 121 8C for 15 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, for 28 days. The mycelia biomass accumulated in the Erlenmeyers was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was subjected to a liquid–liquid partition with EtOAc (3 2 L). The EtOAc fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g). 3.4.1. Extraction and isolation of compound 1 The crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g) was puriﬁed by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting with MeOH, to afford 08 fractions (F-1–F-8, 100 mL portions). Compound 1 (175.0 mg) was obtained from fractions F-6 to F-7 as a yellow amorphous powder. 3.5. Growth of Penicillium sp. and growth medium extraction The Penicillium sp. strain was inoculated in nine Erlenmeyers (500 mL each), containing each one: 90 g of corn meal in 75 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 8C for 40 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C in still mode during 21 days. At the end of the growth period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 250 mL). The MeOH was evaporated, to give 15 g of the MeOH extract. The MeOH extract was dissolved in MeCN and then subjected to liquid– liquid partition with hexane. The MeCN fraction was evaporated to give 6.0 g of a MeCN-deffated extract. 3.5.1. Extraction and Isolation of compounds 2 and 3 The MeCN-deffated fraction obtained (6.0 g) was fractionated using a C18 reversed-phase CC, eluted with a gradient of MeOH in H2O (5–100% MeOH), to afford 16 fractions (Fr1–Fr16). Fraction Fr- 2 (218.0 mg) was further separated using RP-HPLC [l = 254 nm, 10.0 ml/min, 8:2 H2O–MeCN (80 min)], to give compounds 2 (6.3 mg, Rt = 40.3 min) and 3 (6.1 mg, Rt = 30.0 min).

Antifungal activity Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. Compounds 1–3 were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.00 and 1.00 mg samples of pure compounds. After eluting with CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the plates were sprayed with the fungi suspension (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was used as a positive control at 1.0 mg. 3.7. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity Acetylcholinesterase (1000 U) was dissolved in 150 mL of 0.05 M Tris–hydrochloric acid buffer at pH 7.8. Bovine serum albumin (150 mg) was added to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 8C. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol) in order to clean the plates before drying at 30 8C. After elution of samples in CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the TLC plates were dried at 30 8C for complete removal of solvent. The plates were then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and carefully dried at r.t. again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was deposited ﬂat over plastic plugs in a covered plastic tank containing a small amount of H2O, in order to keep the humidity constant. The incubation of plates was performed at 37 8C for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1- naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple coloration after 1–2 min (if positive). Galantamine was employed as positive control 1.0 mg (Marston et al., 2002).

In the present work, the cytotoxicity of pristimerin was eval- uated in human tumor cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This work also examined the eﬀects of pri- stimerin (0.4; 0.8 and 1.7 lM) in HL-60 cells, after 6, 12 and 24 h of exposure. Pristimerin reduced the number of viable cells and increased number of non-viable cells in a concentration-dependent manner by tripan blue test showing morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. Nevertheless, pristimerin was not selective to cancer cells, since it inhibited PBMC proliferation with an IC50 of 0.88 lM. DNA synthesis inhibition assessed by 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in HL-60 cells was 70% and 83% for the concen- trations of 0.4 and 0.8 lM, respectively. Pristimerin (10 and 20 lM) was not able to inhibit topoisomerase I. In AO/EB (acridine orange/ ethidium bromide) staining, all tested concentrations reduced the number of HL-60 viable cells, with the occurrence of necrosis and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, results in agreement with trypan blue exclusion ﬁndings. The analysis of membrane integrity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by ﬂow cytometry in the presence of pristimerin indicated that treated cells under- went apoptosis. The present data point to the importance of pristimerin as representative of an emerging class of potential anticancer chemicals, exhibiting an antiproliferative eﬀect by inhibiting DNA synthesis and triggering apoptosis. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite many therapeutic advances, mortality is still unacceptably high (Reddy et al., 2003). Most of the drugs used today in the clinic were ﬁrst discovered from plants and microorganisms (Mann, 2002). Thus, natural products continue to perform an essential role in the search for new anti-cancer molecules. Chemical studies carried out on Celastraceae species have revealed the occurrence of phenolic metabolites, such as condensed tannins (Gonzalez et al., 1982), ﬂavonoids (Corsino et al., 2003) and quinonemethide triterpenes (Cor- sino et al., 2000; Buﬀa Filho et al., 2002a,b; Carvalho et al., 2005). The quinonemethide triterpenoids of the Celastra- ceae family have a variety of biological activities, such as 0887-2333/$ - see front matter 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Pessoa). www.elsevier.com/locate/toxinvit Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971), antioxi- dant (Jeller et al., 2004; Carvalho et al., 2005) and antima- larial (Figueiredo et al., 1998). Maytenus ilicifolia Martius (Celastraceae) is popularly known as ‘‘espinheira santa”, being well known for allevi- ating stomach pain, nausea and treating ulcers and gastritis (Camparoto et al., 2002). In vivo studies have proved the eﬀectiveness of M. ilicifolia in ethanol- and/or indometha- cin-induced gastric lesion models (Bersani-Amado et al., 2000). Pristimerin (Fig. 1) (20a-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-24-nor-frie- dela-1-10,3,5,7-tetraen-carboxylic acid-29-methylester) is a quinonemethide triterpenoid, which in nature is restricted to the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families (Dirsch et al., 1997). Dirsch et al. (1997) demonstrated that pristim- erin inhibits the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by a mechanism that involves inhibition of NFKB activation, thereby contributing to its anti-inﬂammatory activity. It is also known that pristimerin exhibits cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines (Chang et al., 2003). However, the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic eﬀect of pristimerin has not been completely explored. In 2005, Wu et al. (2005), observed that human breast cancer cells (MDA/ MB-231) treated with pristimerin showed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and a decrease of mito- chondrial membrane potential leading to apoptosis. More recently, Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated that pristimerin induces death of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) by its potent proteasomal inhibition. Although this compound has a variety of reported bio- logical activities, the eﬀect of pristimerin on human leuke- mia cell lines and the underlying mechanism of action have never been investigated. In this way, the aim of the present work was to determine the antiproliferative eﬀects of pri- stimerin on diﬀerent human cancer cell lines and in periph- eral blood monocluear cells (PBMC). Its mechanism of action was also evaluated in leukemia cancer cell line HL-60. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Extraction and isolation of pristimerin Dried and powdered root bark of M. ilicifolia (900.0 g) was extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to aﬀord a brown gum (606.0 g), which was submitted to liquid-liquid partition- ing. The CH2Cl2 soluble part of the EtOH extract was con- centrated in vacuo (121.0 g), submitted to a silica gel column chromatography (700 g, 70–230 mesh) with hex- ane/EtOAc gradient elution, yielding 43 fractions (A1– A43). Fraction A10–A14 (2.88 g) was submitted to ﬂash sil- ica gel column chromatography (230–400 mesh) with hex- ane/EtOAc gradient elution, resulting in 38 fractions (B1–B38). Fraction B12–B14 (0.609 g) was submitted to preparatory reverse phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), c = 420 nm, 10 mL/min] to aﬀord pristimerin (retention time = 21.0 min; 0.310 g; MW = 464.6). 2.2. Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines The cytotoxic potential of pristimerin was evaluated by the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983), against ﬁve human tumor cell lines: HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), K-562 (chronic myelocytic leukemia), SF-295 (glyoblastoma), HCT-8 (colon cancer) and MDA/MB-435 (melanoma), all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin, at 37 C with 5% CO2. Tumor cell growth was quantiﬁed by the ability of living cells to reduce the yel- low dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetra- zolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product (Mosmann, 1983). Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.7 105 cells/well for adherent cells and 0.3 105 cells/well for suspended cells) and pristimerin (0.08–53.7 lM) dissolved in DMSO 1% was added to each well. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL). Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dis- solved in 150 lL DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin was used as positive control. The cytotoxicity of pristimer- in was also evaluated after 24 h of incubation in order to establish the concentrations for the studies in HL-60 cells. 2.3. Inhibition of PBMC proliferation – Alamar Blue assay In order to investigate the selectivity of pristimerin toward a normal proliferating cell, the Alamar Blue assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug exposure. Heparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug at least 15 days prior to sampling) was collected and O H O CH3 C H3 CH3 CH3 CH3 C H3 O O CH3 H Fig. 1. Structure of pristimerin isolated from M. ilicifolia. P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 855 PBMC were isolated by a standard method of density-gra- dient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 3 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mL streptomycin at 37 C with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (3%) was added at the beginning of culture. After 24 h, the compound (0.08–53.7 lM) dis- solved in DMSO 1% were added to each well and incu- bated for 72 h. Doxorubicin (0.02–8.6 lM) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incuba- tion, 10 lL of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of the Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma–Aldrich Co) was added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter) and the drug eﬀect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of con- trol absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of the medium is also measured at the higher and lower wave- lengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absor- bance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absor- bance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOLW. A correction factor R0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOLW, where R0 = AOLW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced then is expressed as follows: % reduced = ALW(AHW R0) 100. 2.4. Study of the mechanism involved in the leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity The following experiments were performed in order to investigate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic eﬀect of pristimerin against HL-60 cells using a 24 h exposure. Pristimerin dissolved in sterilized DMSO (vehicle control) was added to cell cultures of HL-60 cells (3 105 cells/ mL) to obtain ﬁnal concentrations of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 lM, corresponding to IC50/2, IC50 and two times IC50 values obtained by the MTT assay after 24 h of incubation. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. 2.4.1. Trypan blue exclusion Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (Renzi et al., 1993) after incubation of HL- 60 cells with pristimerin. Aliquots from wells were removed from cultures after 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber. 2.4.2. Inhibition of DNA synthesis HL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with pristimerin. Before the end of a 24 h drug exposure, 20 lL of 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37 C. To determine the amount of BrdU incorpo- rated into DNA (Pera et al., 1977), cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and covers- lipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was per- formed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per sample to determine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. 2.4.3. DNA relaxation assay The inhibitory eﬀects of pristimerin (10 and 20 lM) on human Topo I were measured using Topo I Drug Screen- ing Kit (TopoGEN, Inc.). Supercoiled (Form I) plasmid DNA (250 ng) was incubated with human Topo I (4 units) at 37 C for 30 min in relaxation buﬀer (10 mM Tris buﬀer pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine and 5% glycerol) in the absence or presence of 10 and 20 lM pristimerin (ﬁnal 20 lL). Campothecin (0.1 mM) was used as positive control. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10% SDS (2 lL). Proteinase K (50 lg/mL) was added and incubated at 37 C for 30 min. DNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel for 120 min at room temperature, and visual- ized with ethidium bromide. 2.4.4. Analysis of morphological changes Untreated or pristimerin-treated HL-60 cells were exam- ined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metr- impex Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar lab). To evaluate morphology, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, ﬁxed with ethanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H/E). Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. 2.4.5. Morphological analysis with ﬂuorescence microscopy Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining (McGahon et al., 1995) of HL-60 cells was performed to evaluate the cell death pattern induced by increasing con- centrations of pristimerin. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. After 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted and each sample was mixed with 1 lL of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 lg/mL of AO in PBS; 100 lg/mL EB in PBS) just prior to ﬂuorescence micros- copy and quantiﬁcation (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hundred cells were counted per sample and scored as fol- lows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells (Geng et al., 2003; Cury-Boaventura et al., 2004). 2.4.6. Flow cytometry analysis 2.4.6.1. Cell membrane integrity. HL-60 cell membrane integrity was evaluated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 lg/mL). Cell ﬂuorescence was then determined by ﬂow cytometry in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were 856 P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 evaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.4.6.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. HL-60 cells were incubated at 25 C for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 lg/mL propidium iodide. Cell ﬂuorescence was then determined by ﬂow cytometry in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.5. Statistical analysis For cytotoxicity assays, the IC50 values and their 95% conﬁdence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Graphpad program (Intuitive Software for Sci- ence, San Diego, CA). In order to determine diﬀerences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman–Keuls test (P < 0.01). 3. Results 3.1. Cytotoxicity assays The MTT analysis showed that pristimerin exhibited cytotoxic activity against all ﬁve cancer cell lines. Based on data collected from two independent experiments car- ried out in triplicate, the IC50 values ranged from 0.55 to 3.2 lM in MDA/MB-435 and K-562, respectively, after 72 h of incubation with pristimerin (Table 1). The IC50 val- ues obtained in PBMC for pristimerin and doxorubicin were 0.88 (0.75–1.03) and 1.66 (0.89–3.10) lM, respec- tively, also after 72 h of incubation. All subsequent experiments were conducted on HL-60 cell lines to determine the mechanism of action of pristim- erin in this cell line. 3.2. Pristimerin reduces cell viability and inhibits DNA synthesis Pristimerin produced a signiﬁcant decrease (P < 0.01) in cell viability and increased number of non-viable cells as soon as 6 h exposure, which occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). To further under- stand the antiproliferative activity, the incorporation of the nucleoside BrdU into DNA was measured by direct perox- idase immunocytochemistry assay. In Fig. 3, we can see that HL-60 cells treated by pristimerin showed about 30% and 17% of BrdU incorporation at the concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 lM, respectively (P < 0.01), while doxorubi- cin (0.6 lM) lead to 24% of incorporation. BrdU positive cells in control correspond to 65%. Since pristimerin was able to inhibit DNA synthesis, it could be a suitable candi- date to cause inhibition of topoisomerase. However, pri- stimerin (10 and 20 lM) did not show any eﬀect in the DNA relaxation assay (data not shown). 3.3. Pristimerin alters cell morphology Analysis by H/E of HL-60 treated and untreated cells revealed several drug-induced morphological changes. Con- trol cells exhibited a typical non-adherent and vacuolization round morphology after 24 h in culture (Fig. 4A). The cells treated at all concentrations showed a progressive DNA fragmentation, a reduction in cell volume and destabiliza- tion of the plasma membrane, indicating an increasing pro- gression toward cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C–E). Pyknotic nuclei were observed at higher doses as early as 6 h of treatment. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) also induced reduction in cell volume, besides nuclear fragmenta- tion and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). 3.4. Pristimerin induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells To further determine whether the growth-inhibitory eﬀect of pristimerin was related to the induction of apopto- sis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/ EB staining by ﬂuorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment with the compound, a decreasing number of viable cells (Fig. 5A) and an increasing number of apop- totic cells (Fig. 5B) were observed in a dose-dependent manner. As early as 6 h of pristimerin (0.4 lM) exposure (P < 0.01), apoptosis was observed. Regarding necrosis, a signiﬁcant increase was seen at 0.8 lM after 6 h of treat- ment (Fig. 5C), while extensive cell damage indicative of necrosis occurred only at 1.7 lM after 24 h (P < 0.01). 3.5. Pristimerin disrupts cell membrane integrity The propidium iodide intercalation test showed that pri- stimerin caused disruption of the cell membrane in HL-60 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The results revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in cell viability starting at 0.8 lM Table 1 Cytotoxic activity of pristimerin in tumor cell lines Substance CI50 (lg/ml (lM))a HL-60 K-562 MDA/MB- 435 SF-295 HCT-8 Doxorubicin 0.02 (0.04) 0.14 (0.24) 0.48 (0.83) 0.23 (0.40) 0.01 (0.02) 0.01–02 0.09–23 0.34–0.66 0.19– 0.25 0.01– 0.02 Pristimerin 0.61 (1.31) 1.49 (3.20) 0.26 (0.55) 0.57 (1.22) 0.69 (1.48) 0.56– 0.67 1.17– 1.90 0.20–0.34 0.38– 0.85 0.59– 0.82 a Data are presented as IC50 values and 95% conﬁdence intervals for leukemia (HL-60, K562), breast (MDA/MB-435), glyoblastoma (SF-295) and colon (HCT-8) human cancer cells. Doxorubicin was used as positive control. Experiments were performed in triplicate. P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 857 after 12 h and 24 h exposure with percent inhibition values of 18% and 25%, respectively. This activity was also shown to be dependent on time exposure (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). 3.6. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was examined by ﬂow cytometry in HL-60 cells. All DNA that was sub-dip- loid in size was considered fragmented. All concentrations of pristimerin tested led to a signiﬁcant increase in DNA fragmentation (P < 0.01) in a time- and dose-dependent way. After 12 h of exposure, pristimerin at all concentra- tions produced a peak of DNA fragmentation (38.43%, 68.23% and 79% for 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 lM, respectively) (Fig. 6B). 4. Discussion Various compounds derived from plant secondary metabolites are commonly used in cancer chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, camptothecin and tenoposide. Chemo- therapy has been improved over the past years, but until now, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, mainly because of side eﬀects or multi-drug resistance. Moreover, it is important to ﬁnd new molecules with activity against cancer with more speciﬁc eﬀects (Kamb, 2005). In this con- text, many researches have found bioactive metabolites in plants of the Celastraceae family with antitumor (quinon- emethide triterpens) and cytotoxic (triterpene dimers) activities (Shirota et al., 1994), which makes these com- pounds promising new anti-cancer drug candidates. In this work, we investigated the eﬀect of pristimerin iso- lated from M. ilicifolia in ﬁve human tumor cell lines (HL- 60, HCT-8, SF-295, MDA/MB-435 and K-562) and in nor- mal proliferating PBMC.

Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 action of pristimerin was further evaluated in the promyel- ocitic leukemia cell line HL-60. In the ﬁrst part of this study, pristimerin showed high cytotoxicity against all cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.55 lM (MDA/MB- 435) to 3.2 lM (K-562) after 72 h. Goncalves de Lima et al. (1971) and Setzer et al. (1998) also demonstrated that quinonemethide triterpenoids isolated from the Celastraceae family inhibits cell growth. Our study also corroborates the ﬁndings of Wu et al. (2005) showing that pristimerin inhibits cell growth of cancer cell lines: A-549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) and Hep3B (liver) with IC50 values ranging from 0.42 to 0.61 lM. In the present work, we also demonstrated that pristimerin was cytotoxic to PBMC in the same concentration range than to leukemia cells, suggesting a poor selectivity of this compound. When considering the chemotherapy side eﬀects, it is very impor- tant to verify whether the drug shows a harmful eﬀect against normal dividing cells such as proliferating lymphocytes (Zuco et al., 2002; Anazetti et al., 2003). Mammalian cells provide an excellent tool for study- ing cytotoxic substances, where the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line is one of the most often used model for this purpose (Collins, 1987; Milita˜o et al., 2006). In try- ing to identify the mechanism of action involved in the Fig. 4.

Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 859 antiproliferative eﬀects of pristimerin, we assessed changes in cell viability and morphology (induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis) and inhibition of DNA synthesis and topoisomerase activity. First, the antiproliferative action was conﬁrmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, which is a suitable and useful test to determine eﬀects on cell proliferation and viability (Renzi et al., 1993). At all concentrations tested, pristimer- in reduced the number of viable cells, which was more evi- dent at higher concentrations (0.8 and 1.7 lM). These results are consistent with the MTT ﬁndings and ﬂow cytometry. The antiproliferative eﬀects were further investigated to determine the mechanism underlying pristimerin cytotoxic- ity. DNA synthesis was aﬀected by treatment with pristim- erin at all concentrations in a dose-dependent way, with extensive cell destruction at 1.7 lM, which made quantiﬁ- cation diﬃcult. Current cancer chemotherapy drugs such as intercalating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors can inhibit DNA synthesis. This inhibition can be due to sev- eral cellular processes such as DNA topology state. More- over, topoisomerase plays an important role by altering the topological state of DNA in events such as overwinding, underwinding, and catenation, and it is involved in prolif- erative processes such as DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and chromosome segregation. We investi- gated the eﬀect of pristimerin on topoisomerase I activity, since this enzyme can be a primordial target for the action 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * * * * * * Number of viable cells 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * * * * * * Number of apoptotic cells 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * Number of necrotic cells Fig. 5.

Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 of a wide variety of anti-cancer drugs (Li and Liu, 2001). However, pristimerin was not able to inhibit human topo- isomerase I activity indicating that the antiproliferative mechanism of pristimerin is probably due to alterations in another pathway. In order to determine the mechanism of cell death, alter- ations in cell morphology were examined. Some authors have considered the distinction between apoptosis and necrosis diﬃcult and controversial. According to Masque- lier et al. (2004), the morphological deﬁnition is commonly based on membrane integrity. Dartsch et al. (2002) and Schultz and Harrington (2003) considered crucial points for distinguishing apoptosis from necrosis: an early occur- rence of nuclear and DNA fragmentation concomitant with membrane integrity, showing apoptotic bodies, phos- phatidylserine externalization, reduction of nuclear volume and chromatin condensation. Generally, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is a great beneﬁt for cancer chemo- therapy (Reddy et al., 2003). In the morphological studies, appreciable DNA frag- mentation was observed at the all doses, with highest one revealing signs of extensive destabilization of the plasma membrane with loss of integrity, reduction of cell volume and pyknotic nuclei typical of necrotic processes (Hannun, 1997; Desoize and Sen, 1992). As seen in cytometry analy- sis, pristimerin induced an increase in sub-G1 population cells, which was concentration and time-dependent, sug- gesting that cells underwent DNA fragmentation, an important hallmark of apoptosis. Moreover, in AO/EB ﬂuorescence experiments, pristimerin treated cells dis- played characteristics of apoptosis as fragmented and con- densed nuclei and a brilliant intense green ﬂuorescence, with exception of 24 h exposure at 1.7 lM, which revealed necrosis as probably the result of late apoptosis. These ﬁndings are in agreement with those reported by Wu et al. (2005) who showed that pristimerin causes apoptosis induction in MDA/MB-231 cells triggering a rapid and time-dependent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria within 0.5 h and activation of caspase-3, acting by the intrinsic pathway.

It is involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among the proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, cathepsin V is a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In the present work, natural ﬂavonoids were screened against cathepsin V, and two ﬂavones were identiﬁed as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. On the basis of this result, a combinatorial library of chalcones and ﬂavones was prepared, in solution phase employing a scavenger reagent, and fully evaluated. Introduction Coronary arterial disease is one of the major causes of human death. In this context, atherosclerosis, which is characterized by a thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall, is the leading cause of cardiac illness. Cathepsin V is a papain-like cysteine protease, involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among proteolytic enzymes.1,2 It is predominantly expressed in the thymus, testicles, and epithelial corneal. Although cathepsin V can be considered a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, few inhibitors are described in the literature.2,3 The benzopyranone-ring system, found in ﬂavonoids, is a molecular scaffold of considerable interest, and some reports describe this class of compounds as inhibitors of cathepsin acitvity. Kenyon and co-workers reported the activity of chalcone derivatives toward the enzyme cathepsin B.4,5 Patil et al. isolated a new dimeric dihydrochalcone and a preny- lated ﬂavone from Artocarpus altilis (Moraceae) which are potent inhibitors of cathepsin K, with IC50 values of 98 and 840 nM, respectively.6 Pan et al.7 and Zeng et al.8 described biﬂavones isolated from Taxodium mucronatum (Taxodiacea) and Cycas guizhouensis (Cycadaceae) with activity against cathepsin B and K. Bauvois et al. examined the effects of synthetic ﬂavones on a number of metalloproteinases, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase as well as serine proteases such as cathepsin G.9 Medicinal chemistry efforts have focused on diversifying the benzopyranone scaffold and utilizing combinatorial chemistry approaches to construct small benzopyranone libraries.10 In the literature are described several ﬂavonoid libraries synthesized in solution phase, such as, for example, chalcones11–13 and ﬂavones.14,15 Solid-phase organic synthesis (SPOS) has long been an integral component of the synthetic repertoire employed by combinatorial chemists.16 In SPOS, solid support-bound substrates are elaborated synthetically by using an excess of reagents to drive reactions to completion. Desired products can then be isolated easily by simple ﬁltration and removed from the support material. Previous reviews have discussed the importance of combinatorial libraries of ﬂavonoids prepared by solid phase synthesis.17–19 Nicolaou et al. reported a solid-phase synthesis of a 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran motif employing a cycloloading strategy that relies on the use of a polystyrene-based selenenyl bromide resin.20 Harikrishnan and Showalter prepared a small library of isoﬂavone analogues employing a solid-supported diisopro- pylsilyloxy traceless linker.21 Cheng et al. prepared a small library of chalcones via parallel solid phase synthesis.22 A different strategy was employed by Yao et al. for the preparation of a ﬂavone library.23 A functionalized ﬂavone was prepared in solution phase by classical Claisen conden- sation, mixed acid nitration, and oxidative cyclization reac- tion with iodine-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Then, the ﬂavone was employed as scaffold for the synthesis of a combinatorial library in solid phase. Arai et al. developed an efﬁcient one-pot synthesis by Michael aldol reaction of chromone and ﬂavonoid derivatives bearing heterocyclic units.24 The 2,3-heterocyclic-substituted chromones were obtained in one step. Moreover, the use of substituted benzaldehydes and subsequent addition of heterocyclic aldehydes gave 3-pyridyl-substituted ﬂavones. They have also examined these one-pot reactions in the solid phase by attaching the acetophenone derivative to (4-methoxyphenyl)- diisopropylsilylpropyl polystyrene beads. * Towhomcorrespondenceshouldbeaddressed.E-mail:agcorrea@ufscar.br.

Chem. 2010, 12, 687–695 687 10.1021/cc100076k 2010 American Chemical Society Published on Web 06/25/2010 SPOS has many advantages but also many limiting drawbacks: it can be difﬁcult to adapt conventional solution phase chemistry to a solid-phase format, some solid-phase reactions are signiﬁcantly slower than they are when run in solution, and the progress of solid-phase reactions can be difﬁcult to monitor.11 An alternative is the use of polymer- supported reagents, catalysts, and cleanup agents (scavengers) which facilitate reactions of substrates in solution. For example, a solid-supported reagent can be used to drive to completion a coupling reaction between two reactive sub- strates, one of which is present in excess. A support-bound scavenger can then be used to remove the excess reagent, yielding pure product. Or a support-bound capture reagent can be used to remove the coupling product directly, which is then cleaved from the support.25 Bhat et al. employed a piperazinyl Merriﬁeld resin in the synthesis of a library of ﬂavones.26 Huang et al. described a solid-phase synthesis of ﬂavones employing a Lewis acid-mediated polystyrene- supported selenium induced intramolecular cyclization of chalcones.27 After the oxidative cleavage of selenium resin, the ﬂavones were obtained in good overall yields and high purity. In the present work, we describe the use of tosyl hydrazide scavenger resin in the preparation of a combinatorial library of chalcone and ﬂavone derivatives, identiﬁed as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. Results and Discussion In an ongoing program toward the development of speciﬁc, potent inhibitors of cathepsin V enzyme, several natural products were screened. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation: where Vi and V0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determined in the presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively. Among some other active compounds, a series of ﬂa- vonoids showed interesting activity at initial concentration of 25 µM. The most potent compounds were ﬂavones 1 and 2 (Figure 1), isolated from Vitex polygama (Verbenaceae)28 and Lonchocarpus subglaucescens (Leguminoseae),29 re- spectively, with IC50 ) 2.5 and 13.5 µM. The IC50 values correspond to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V, and were determined from collected data by non-linear regression analysis. On the basis of these results, a small library of ﬂavonoids waspreparedinsolutionphaseemployingtheClaisen-Schmidt condensation,30 followed by oxidative cyclization catalyzed by I2 (Scheme 1).31 The library components were obtained in moderate to good yields and were characterized by 1H NMR and MS. The compounds then were submitted to biochemical evaluation against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 1). In this small series we have already identiﬁed ﬂavone (6d) with a higher inhibition activity than the natural products 1 Figure 1. Natural ﬂavonoids evaluated against cathepsin V. Scheme 1.

To evaluate a larger number of ﬂavonoids and establish some structure-activity relationships, a ﬂavone library was prepared through parallel synthesis using the polystyrene-tosyl hydrazide (PS-Ts-NHNH2) (7) as a car- bonyl scavenging resin.32 Before carrying out the synthesis of the library some tests were realized to optimize the reaction conditions using the resin. The best results were obtained using 0.075 mmol of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxyace- tophenone, 0.1 mmol of resin 7, and 0.1 mmol of 2,4- dimethoxybenzaldehyde, at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and the presence of the aldehydes was not observed. Following the reaction conditions previously tested, a library of chalcones and ﬂavones was prepared (Scheme 2) using 4 acetophenones (3) (Figure 2) and 6 aldehydes (4) as building blocks (Figure 3). The diversity of the library was planned based on the structure of natural products 1 and 2, which are highly oxygenated, and also on the commercial availability of reagents. The reactions were carried out in 24 reaction vessels of a Bu¨chi Syncore synthesizer. Initially, for the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, to a solution containing the acetophenone 3 and the aldehyde 4 in methanol was added an aqueous solution of 50% KOH. After 3 h at 75 °C, an aqueous solution of 10% HCl was added to neutralize the mixture. Excess of aldehyde was removed from the reaction mixture by the use of resin scavenger 7 in dimethylformamide (DMF). Oxidative cyclization was carried out in DMSO at 150 °C for 1 h using iodine as catalyst. Thirteen chalcones 5 were puriﬁed by preparative TLC and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 2). As observed before, the chalcones showed no activity. The ﬂavones were puriﬁed by SPE or preparative TLC. Analyses Table 1.

Combinatorial Library of Chalcones and Flavones Journal of Combinatorial Chemistry, 2010 Vol. 12, No. 5 689 by HPLC in three different wavelengths (254, 280, and 320 nm) showed that 21 ﬂavones 6 were prepared in low to moderate yield (13-68%) and good to high purity (80-95%). All compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and the spectroscopic data were compared with those reported in the literature.33–57 The library components were submitted to biochemical evaluation (Table 3). The ﬁrst aspect of the validation of these results was the analysis of false positives. Depending on the assay design and detection method used for the screening assay, various artifacts can occur that lead to wrong results. Before performing the screening, all compounds were analyzed on a ﬂuorimeter using the test conditions without the addition of the enzyme. Flavones 6a, 6c, 6{1,2}, 6{2,4}, and 6{4,4} showed intrinsic ﬂuorescence; thus, it was not possible to verify their potency as inhibitors. Compounds that inhibited more than 50% were selected for determination of IC50 values. When diluted, ﬂavones 6{1,1}, 6{1,3}, and 6{2,1} showed ﬂuorescence above the control, suggesting that at lower concentrations these compounds may cause a confor- mational change of the protein, and it was not possible to observe the ﬂuorescence quenching, thus interfering with the response of the test. Most of the ﬂavones showed signiﬁcant inhibition with IC50 values varying in the range of 0.8-25.1 µM. Primary studies on the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the ﬂavonoids suggest the importance of the ring C. Interestingly the chalcones exhibited lower inhibition in a unique con- centration demonstrating that cyclization to form the C ring is relevant to interaction between enzyme site and inhibitor. We also observed that among the most potent compounds, ﬂavones 6d, 6{3,1}, and 6{3,2} (IC50 ) 1.2, 0.8, and 1.6 µM, respectively) possess one halogen (bromine or ﬂuorine) as substituent in the A ring and methoxy groups in the C ring. In conclusion, despite the lack of a detailed experimental enzyme-inhibitor complex, from the natural products screen- ing, we have been able to identify synthetic ﬂavones with increased potency. These results indicate the potential of this class as promising inhibitors of cathepsin V. To further investigate these results and thus generate useful data for the computer aided molecular design, modeling studies are being performed through docking protocol. 3. Experimental Section All commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Reagents and solvents were puriﬁed when necessary according to the usual procedures described in the literature. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-200 (200 and 50 MHz respectively). The IR spectra refer to ﬁlms and were measured on a Bomem M102 spectrometer. Mass Spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on a 0.25 µm ﬁlm of silica gel containing ﬂuorescent indicator UV254 supported on an aluminum sheet (Sigma-Aldrich). Flash column chromatography was per- formed using silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 230-400 mesh, E. Merck). Gas chromatography was performed in a Shimadzu GC-17A with H2 as carrier and using a DB-5 column. Solid- phase extraction (SPE) was carried out using silica cartridges (Phenomenex Strata Silica SL-1, 500 mg, 6 mL). HPLC analyses were performed in Shimadzu equipment with a LC- 20AT pump, SIL-10A injector, SPD-20A detector, and in a Phenomenex column Luna C18(2) 5 µm (150 × 4.6 mm). The combinatorial library was prepared in a Syncore Bu¨chi synthesizer. General Procedure for the Synthesis of Chalcones 5a-e. To a solution of acetophenone 3 and aldehyde 4 in methanol was added an aqueous solution of KOH 50% (Table 5). The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 3 h, and Table 3.

Synthesis of the Combinatorial Library of Flavones 6. In 24 reaction vessels of a Bu¨chi Syncore synthesizer was placed a solution of acetophenone 3{1-4} (0.075 mmol) and aldehyde 4{1-6} (0.10 mmol) (Figure 2) in methanol (2.0 mL). Then it was added an aqueous solution of KOH 50% (150 µL). The mixture was stirred at 75 °C for 3 h, and then an aqueous solution of HCl 10% (750 µL) was added. The solvent was evaporated, then ethyl acetate (3 mL) was added and the organic layer was transferred to another vessel. This procedure was repeated three times and then concentrated under vacuum. Then DMF (1 mL) was added followed by PS-Ts-NHNH2 (7) (50 mg, 0.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, then it was washed with methylene chloride (3 mL), and the organic layer was transferred to another vessel. This procedure was repeated three times; then the solvent was evaporated furnishing chalcones 5. One third was separated for further character- ization and bioassays. To the previously prepared chalcones 5 was added a 1 mg/mL solution of iodine in DMSO (1 mL). The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 150 °C, and then an aqueous solution of 0.1 M sodium thiosulfate (0.1 mL) was added. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum, and the crude product was puriﬁed by SPE using silica gel (500 mg) and methylene chloride: ethyl acetate (8:2) or preparative TLC using hexane: ethyl acetate (8:2) as eluent. The ﬂavones 6 were analyzed by HPLC (see Table 3), characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme. 4′-Benzyloxy-2′-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone (5{1,1}).37 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.86 (s, 3H); 5.11 (s, 2H); 6.47-6.62 (m, 2H); 6.94 (d, J ) 8.6 Hz, 2H); 7.30-7.53 (m, 6H); 7.61 (d, J ) 8.6 Hz, 2H); 7.82 (d, J ) 2.8 Hz, 1H); 7.88 (d, J ) 8.7 Hz, 1H); 13.52 (s, 1H). 4′-Benzyloxi-2′-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethoxychalcone (5{1,3}).38 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.90 (s, 3H); 3.92 (s, 3H); 3.97 (s, 3H); 5,11 (s, 2H); 6.50-6.62 (m, 2H); 6.73 (d, J ) 8.9 Hz, 1H); 7.31-7.52 (m, 6H); 7.63 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 7.78-7.90 (m, 1H); 8.05 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 13.56 (s, 1H). 4′-Benzyloxy-2′-hydroxy-4-triﬂuoromethoxychal- cone (5{1,4}). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 5.12 (s, 2H); 6.52-6.64 (s, 2H); 7.25-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.35-7.47 (m, 5H); 7.54 (J ) 15.5 Hz, 1H); 7.63-7.75 (m, 2H); 7.84 (d, J ) 9.5 Hz, 1H); 7.86 (J ) 15.5 Hz, 1H); 13.32 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-4,4′,6′-trimethoxychalcone (5{2,1}):39 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.84 (s, 3H); 3.85 (s, 3H); 3.92 (s, 3H); 5.97 (d, J ) 2.4, 1H); 6.11 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.87-7.02 (m, 2H); 7.51-7.63 (m, 2H); 7.80 (s, 2H); 14.40 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-2,4,4′,6′-tetramethoxychalcone (5{2,2}).40 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.83 (s, 3H); 3.86 (s, 3H); 3.90 (s, 3H); 3.91 (s, 3H); 5.96 (dd, J ) 2.4, 0.2 Hz, 1H); 6.10 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.47 (dd, J ) 2.4, 0.3 Hz, 1H); 6.53 (ddd, J ) 8.5, 2.3, 0.3 Hz, 1H); 7.55 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, 1H); 7.90 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 8.11 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 14.54 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-2,3,4,4′,6′-pentamethoxychalcone (5{2,3}).41 1H NMR(200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.84 (s, 3H); 3.89 (s, 3H); 3.91 (s, 3H); 3.95 (s, 3H); 5.96 (d, J ) 2.4, 1H); 6.11 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.72 (d, J ) 8.8 Hz, 1H); 7.35 (d, J ) 8.8 Hz, 1H); 7.90 (d, J ) 15.8 Hz, 1H); 8.02 (d, J ) 15.8 Hz, 1H); 14.44 (s, 1H). 4-Phenyl-2′-hydroxy-4′,6′-dimethoxychalcone (5{2,6}). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.85 (s, 3H); 3.94 (s, 3H); 5.98 (d, J ) 2.3 Hz, 1H); 6.12 (d, J ) 2.3 Hz, 1H); 7.35-7.55 (m, 3H); 7.57-7.75 (m, 6H); 15.65 (d, J ) 15.7 Hz, 1H); 7.96 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 14.32 (s, 1H). 5′-Fluoro-2′-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone (5{3,1}).42 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.88 (s, 3H); 6.91-7.06 (m, 3H); 7.17-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.42 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 7.52-7.2 (m, 3H); 7.93 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 12.65 (s, 1H). 5′-Fluoro-2′-hydroxy-2,4-dimethoxychalcone (5{3,2}). mp 106-107 °C. 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.87 (s, 3H); 3.93 (s, 3H); 6.48 (d, J ) 2.2 Hz, 1H); 6.55 (dd, J ) 8.5, 2.2 Hz, 1H); 6.97 (dd, J ) 9.0, 4.8 Hz, 1H); 7.14-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.52-7.67 (m, 3H); 8.18 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 12.81 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 55.5; 55.6; 692 Journal of Combinatorial Chemistry, 2010 Vol. 12, No. 5 Alvim, Jr. et al. 98.5; 105.7; 114.5 (d, J ) 23.1 Hz); 116.7; 117.5; 119.6 (d, J ) 7.0 Hz); 119.9 (d, J ) 6.2 Hz); 123.2 (d, J ) 23.5 Hz); 131.8; 142.2; 154.8 (d, J ) 237.5 Hz); 159.6 (d, J ) 1.6 Hz); 160.9; 163.7; 193 (d, J ) 2.8 Hz).

Inhibitory Activity Assay. Recombinant human cathepsin V was expressed and puriﬁed as described previously.57 The molar concentration of this enzyme was determined by active site titration with E-64. Kinetic measurements were carried out in a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX GEMINI XS. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO, and the inhibitors were screened against the cathe- psin V at initial concentration of 25 µM. The protease inhibitor activity was carried out in triplicate in 96-well black plate with the method previously described by Barret et al.58 The reaction mixture contained 192 µL of a sodium acetate buffer (100 mM, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTE, pH 5.5), 2 µL of 1 mM Z-Phe-Arg-MCA, 5 µL of sample, and 1 µL of cathepsin V (32 nM). The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE at 27 °C, after the solution was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The substrate was added to start the reaction, and the ﬂuorescence of 4-methyl-7- coumaryl-amide (release MCA) was measured at Ex 355 nm and Em 460 nm. Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the E-64 (positive control), an irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase. Values of IC50 were determined by making rate measurements for at least seven inhibitor concentrations. Kinetics parameters were determined from collected data employing the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. References and Notes (1) Yasuda, Y.; Li, Z.; Greenbaum, D.; Bogyo, M.; Weber, E.; Bro¨mme, D.

The isolates were submitted to in vitro evaluation of lipoperoxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and -2) inhibitory properties and showed moderate antioxidant activities (40–70%) at 100 ppm when compared to commercial standards BHT and vitamin E and moderate inhibition of COX-1 (ca. 40%) and marginal inhibition of COX-2 enzymes (<10%) at 100 ppm when compared to nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin, rofecoxib, and celecoxib, respectively. The chemotaxonomy of widely occurring Senna and Cassia (Fabaceae) species has been the subject of extensive studies, leading to reclassiﬁcation of some species, including Cassia spectabilis.1 Both of these genera exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties and ethnomedical uses, especially those associated with inﬂammation.2–6 In Brazil, the tea of their crushed leaves is used to treat throat inﬂammation and diarrhea.7 Therefore, many plants belonging to Senna and Cassia species have been or are being studied for their anti-inﬂammatory botanical extracts or for the isolation of new metabolites with unique chemical structures, mode of action, selectivity, and/or effectiveness. Extracts of species from both genera have been investigated for anti-inﬂammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. For example, Cassia italica is one of the most studied species due to its analgesic, antipyretic, laxative, and antitumor properties.8 Its ethanolic extract decreased the severity of rat paw edema in a potency comparable to acetylsalycilic acid and inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis by rat peritoneal leucocytes.9 An extract of Senna dariensis has been used against snakebite and was highly active in the inhibition of the hemorrhagic effect of the venom from Bothrops atrox,10 whereas Senna neglecta and Senna alata have been used in southern Brazil and Thailand, respectively, to treat inﬂammation linked to microbial infection.11,12 Cassia tora and C. angustifolia leaf extracts have also shown anti-inﬂammatory properties using in vivo models with histamine-induced rat hind paw edema and 12-O-tetradecanoylphor- bol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema, respectively, whereas C. ﬁstula leaves methanolic extract was evaluated in in vitro models and efﬁciently protected free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in model membranes and also inhibited the 5-lipoxy- genase-mediated peroxidation of arachidonic acid.13–15 As part of our ongoing research on active metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of São Paulo State (Brazil), we have recently reported the isolation of several new piperidine alkaloids including (-)-spectaline (2), (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (3), and (+)-spectaline from leaves, ﬂowers, and ripe fruits of Senna spectabilis, which showed anti-inﬂammatory and acetylcholinest- erase inhibitory properties.16–18 Herein we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new piperidine alkaloid, (+)-3-O- feruloylcassine (1), from unripe fruits of Senna spectabilis ((DC.) Irwin & Barneby), along with the identiﬁcation of the known alkaloids 2 and 3. In addition, we also report their free radical scavenging potential toward DPPH, lipoperoxidation (LPO), and cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitory activities. Compound 1 was isolated as a pale yellow solid (mp 7–74 °C). HRESIMS and elemental analysis of 1 indicated the molecular formula C28H43NO5, with eight degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum suggested the presence of secondary amine (3413, 1514 cm-1), ketone (1710 cm-1), and oleﬁnic (3050, 1629, 1529 cm-1) moieties. The 1H NMR spectroscopic signals for two vicinal oleﬁnic methines at δ 7.68 (d, J ) 15.5 Hz, H-7′′) and δ 6.36 (d, J ) 15.5 Hz, H-8′′) with a trans relative conﬁguration, three aromatic methines at δ 7.06 (brs, H-2′′), δ 7.00 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, H-6′′), and δ 6.82 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, H-5′′), and three methoxyl protons at δ 3.81 (s, H-10′′) suggested a feruloyl moiety in compound 1. This spectrum also gave signals for one oxymethine hydrogen at δ 4.99 (brs, H-3), three methyl protons at δ 1.19 (m, H-7), and two methines at δ 3.14 (m, H-2) and 2.80 (m, H-6). The two multiplets at δ 1.62 and 1.48, integrated for four protons, were assigned to H-4eq/H-5eq and H-4ax/H-5ax, respectively, on the basis of correla- tions observed in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum. Signals for methylene protons at δ 1.48 (m, H-1′), 1.16–1.21 (m, H-2′-H-9′), and 2.34 (t, 7.5 Hz, H-10′) and methyl protons at δ 2.06 (s, H-12′) clearly indicated a long saturated side chain as previously observed in compounds 2 and 3.16 The 13C NMR and DEPT-135° spectra showed signals for three methine carbons at δ 69.0, 56.9, and 54.4, * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The joint analysis of the 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and HMBC spectra evidenced signals for a carbonyl carbon at δ 209.6, correlating to methylene protons at δ 2.34 and to methyl protons at δ 2.06, which were assigned to a terminal methyl ketone subunit on the side chain at C-6. The carboxyl signal at δ 166.7 correlated to the oleﬁnic methine at δ 7.68 in the HMBC spectrum and suggested an R,- unsaturated conjugation between the piperidine unit and the 1,3,4- trisubstituted aromatic ring. The downﬁeld value of the methine carbon at δ 69.0, when compared to that in (-)-spectaline (δ 67.9), and its correlation with the H-7 methyl protons led us to propose a conjugated ester at C-3 on the piperidine ring. The HMBC correlations observed for the methoxy protons at δ 3.81 to the quaternary carbon at δ 147.0 and for the aromatic methines H-2′′ (δ 7.06), H-5′′ (δ 6.82) to the carbon at δ 148.3 evidenced the presence of aromatic methoxy and hydroxy substituents at C-3′′ and C-4′′ (Figure 1). The NOESY 1D experiment indicated the position of methoxy at C-3′′ and hydroxy at C-4′′ on the basis of the sole spatial correlation of the methoxy protons and H-2′′. All of these assignments were conﬁrmed by additional HMBC cor- relations and led us to propose the structure of 2-methyl-3-feruloyl- 6-(dodecyl-11′-one)piperidine for compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed by the molecular ion peak at m/z 474.3198 in its HRESIMS. The relative conﬁgurations at C-2, C-3, and C-6 were established by comparison of the coupling constants observed for 1 with those published for 2 and 316,19 and NOESY 1D experiments. The irradiation of the H-2 signal conﬁrmed its relative spatial correla- tions to H-3, H-4ax, H-6, and H-7 protons as cis. Therefore, the structure of 1 was assigned as (+)-2-methyl-3-feruloyl-6-(dodecyl- 11′-one)piperidine. The free radical scavenging activity of compounds 1–3 was evaluated spectrophotometrically by using the stable free radical DPPH and measuring the decrease in absorption at 517 nm. Compounds 2 and 3 were weakly active in this assay and exhibited absorbance variation lower than 10% at 60 ppm. However, compound 1 showed moderate activity (%∆A ) 40% at 60 ppm) when compared to the standard rutin (%∆A ) 92% at 60 ppm), which may be associated with the presence of a feruloyl moiety in the structure of 1. The lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity of the isolates was evaluated by measurement of the ﬂuorescence decay after adding Fe2+ to initiate the oxidation of large unilamellar vesicles. The alkaloids were tested at 100 ppm, the extract was tested at 250 ppm, and commercial antioxidants BHT, BHA, and vitamin E were used as standard reference compounds at 1.9, 2.2, and 4.3 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids 2 and 3 exhibited moderate inhibition (ca. 75% after 21 min, Figure 2) of the liposome peroxidation. Alkaloid 1 showed only 50% inhibition of the LPO, despite the presence of a feruloyl moiety in its structure, which is normally associated with an increase in antioxidant activity. This behavior might be at least partly explained by the possible chelation of Fe2+ ions by compounds 2 and 3, in contrast to the poor ability for Fe2+ chelation of compound 1. The use of AAPH as the free radical initiator, instead of Fe2+, conﬁrmed this observation by showing a similar trend in lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (ca. 50%) by compounds 1–3. Inhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzyme activity of compounds 1-3 was evaluated by polarographic measurement of the oxygen uptake during the COX-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Each alkaloid was tested at 100 ppm and compared to standard reference compounds rofecoxib, celecoxib, and aspirin, which were tested at 1.7, 1.7, and 108 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids 1-3 inhibited COX-1 enzyme by 33, 40, and 58%, respectively. However, the inhibitory activities of COX-2 enzyme by these compounds were marginal (Figure 3). In summary, we have isolated three alkaloids (1–3) from the green fruits of S. spectabilis, which showed weak to moderate free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH and moderate lipoper- oxidation inhibitory properties. In addition, these compounds displayed moderate anti-inﬂammatory activities, especially toward COX-1. Additional research is needed to further explain the anecdotal medicinal claims of this fruit and its potential to be considered as a medicinal or dietary supplement. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were mea- sured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 °C. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X FT spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using the ESI mode and MeOH-H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V). Al2O3 grade I, type WN-3 and silica gel (200–400 mesh) were used in column chromatography and TLC; visualization of TLC plates was made by spraying with iodochloro- platinate reagent (Merck) and Dragendorff’s reagent.

Plant material was collected in February 2004 from a specimen of Senna spectabilis cultivated in the Chemistry Institute at Sao Paulo State University (Araraquara-SP). A voucher (SP 370917) was deposited at the herbarium of São Paulo Botanic Garden, São Paulo-SP, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. Green fruits of S. spectabilis (8 kg) were ground and extracted with EtOH (5 × 5 L). Evaporation of solvent yielded 676 g of a crude extract (8.5%). The extract was analyzed by TLC (silica gel, CHCl3-MeOH-NH4OH, 36:3:1) to conﬁrm the presence of alkaloids by spraying with Dragendorff and iodochloro- platinate reagents. This extract (9 g) was then suspended in MeOH-H2O, 4:1, the insoluble residue was removed by ﬁltration, and the remaining solution was partitioned successively with hexanes, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. Analysis of the organic fractions by TLC revealed that most of the alkaloidal constituents were concentrated in the CH2Cl2 fraction (5.7 g). An aliquot of the CH2Cl2 fraction (1 g) was then fractionated by neutral alumina column chromatography (hexanes/Et2O and Et2O/MeOH gradients) to give 30 fractions. Fractions 1–3 (30.4 mg) were further puriﬁed by neutral alumina column chromatography (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 99:1) and gave compounds 2 (3.4 mg) and 3 (9 mg). Fractions 28–30 (402.6 mg) showed strong UV absorption at 254 nm. An aliquot (200 mg) of this mixture was puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc-MeOH-TEA, 90:9.9: 0.1) to give alkaloid 1 (20.2 mg).

Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed signiﬁcant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Com- pounds 1−4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three diﬀerent strains of P. falciparum in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsins B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases. F or thousands of years, plants have been used as medicines. They represent a source of structurally complex and unusual substances and are therefore an extremely attractive target for chemical and biological studies. One of the rational forms of study in the search for new potential drugs can be through screening, where a wide variety of extracts can be used for speciﬁc biological tests to obtain one or more metabolites with pharmacological potential.1 Metrodorea stipularis belongs to the family Rutaceae, a family that has a wide diversity of metabolites with large structural diversity that expresses diﬀerent pharmacological properties. Only two species of the Metrodorea genus have been investigated for their chemical constituents: M. nigra and M. flavida. M. nigra is the only species shown to contain dihydrochalcones. In addition to Metrodorea, Esenbeckia is, as of yet, the only genus found to produce this class of compound in the Rutaceae family.2−4 Chagas disease aﬀects 8 million people in Latin America, leading to an annual economic loss of approximately $18 billion. This disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. There are only two drugs used for the treatment of this disease, nifurtimox and benznidazole. The former has been banned in some countries of South America, and both cause serious side eﬀects. Cruzipain (cruzain) is an enzyme that participates in the pathway of proteolytic digestion of the parasite and plays an essential role in its life process; thus, it is an interesting biological target in the search for new compounds that can be used in the treatment of this disease.5−8 Plasmodium falciparum is the most malignant of the species causing malaria, and the progressive increase of resistant parasite strains to antimalarials has initiated studies aimed at developing new drugs that may help in the chemotherapy of this disease. Artemisinin and quinine used in the treatment of this disease are plant natural products.9 Cathepsins are cysteine proteases involved in several pathological situations, such as in the progression of malignant tumors and metastases, infectious disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. The malignant tumors are mostly nonencapsulated and invasive, making it diﬃcult for surgical resection. Evidence suggests that cathepsins B and L may facilitate the progression of tumors, and studies of the expression of these enzymes in diﬀerent types of cancer have shown an increase in the expression of cathepsins in humans.10,11 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In a search for new antichagasic compounds, extracts from several Brazilian plants of the Rutaceae family were evaluated against cruzain.

Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX liquid partitioning of the crude ethanol extract from the stems of M. stipularis showed the most promising results, with inhibition of 80% against cruzain at a concentration of 100 μg/ mL. Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6- trihydroxyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1- (5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dime- thylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)- phenyl]propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H- xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2 Compounds 2 and 3 were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESITOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at m/ z 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for 2 and 3, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C25H30O5 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for 2 and 3 showed one singlet at δ 5.92 attributed to H-8′, the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both 2 and 3 the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at δ 1.76 (H-3′) and 2.53 (H-4′) and the methyl groups at δ 1.33 (H-9′ and H-10′). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at δ 6.91 (H-5″ and H-7″) and 6.56 (H-8″) for 2 and signals at δ 6.87 (H-2″), 6.83 (H-6″), and 6.64 (H-5″) for 3 assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound 2 showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at δ 1.73 (H-3″) and 2.69 (H-4″) and the signals of the methyl groups at δ 1.22 (H-8″ and H-9″). Compound 3 displayed one prenyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at δ 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4‴ and H-5‴), one oleﬁnic hydrogen at δ 5.28 (H-2‴), and the methylene signal at δ 3.25 (H-1‴). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in 1 and conﬁrmed the structures of 2 and 3. Compound 4 was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESITOFMS data showed the molecular ion at m/z 478.2714 (calculated m/z 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O5. As mentioned for compounds 2 and 3, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the character- istic signals of the three methyl groups at δ 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at δ 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and conﬁrmed the structure of 4. The dihydrochalcones 1−4 showed inhibition activities against cruzain, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the ﬁrst report of cruzain inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies. Dihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochal- cones 1 and 3 showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these com- pounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more eﬀective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydro- chalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsins such as cathepsin K.12 The dihydrochalcones were also tested against Plasmodium falciparum growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against P. falciparum the dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 showed signiﬁcant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 μM for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against P. falciparum growth for this class of compounds. Four compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases cruzain and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The results described in this paper are signiﬁcant, since this is the ﬁrst report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against cruzain, and it is interesting that compounds 2 and 4 are active against cathepsin B, while compounds 1 and 3 are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of ﬁnding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. All commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co., and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-d6 and methanol-d4, using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe ATMA). MS data were colledted on a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF-Q II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H2SO4/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230−700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna). Plant Materials. The stems of Metrodorea stipularis were collected in July 2010 at the Agronomic Institute in Campinas, SP; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute. Journal of Natural Products Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/np500453x | J. Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B Extraction and Isolation. The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 °C, aﬀording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid−liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against cruzain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed signiﬁcant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromato- graphed over silica gel 60 (φ = 5.0 cm × h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10:0, 15:5, 5:5, 0:10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1− MSD24). Fraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15_1− MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg). Fraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 3.0 cm × h = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD21_1−MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD21_8_1−MSD21_8_20). Subfraction MSD21_8_12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21_8_19 (9 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, φ = 1.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/ACN/H2O (4:1:5) as mobile phase and a ﬂow of 3.5 mL/min to aﬀord 4 (2.5 mg). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2066 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3- methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl]propan-1-one (3): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2040 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl- 2,3,4,4a, 9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4): amor- phous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 2; ESITOFMS m/z 478.2714 (calcd for C30H38O5 m/z 478.2720). Enzyme Inhibition Assays. Cruzain. All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectroﬂuorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured by the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanylarginine-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide). The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.3) with 5 μL of DTT at 37 °C after addition of 2 μL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with ﬁve inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the program GraFit 5. Cathepsins. All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Molecular Devices Spectra Table 1.

Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic ﬂuorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and a concentration of 185 μM for catB and 10 μM for catL. The enzyme was activated for 5 min with DTT and acetate buﬀer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 200 μL, kept under stirring (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with at least seven inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot 12.0. Bioassay of Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth. The strains 3D7, W2, and Dd2 of P. falciparum malaria parasites (BEI Resources, MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in human type O+ erythrocytes in complete medium (RPMI 1640 (Cellgro), 0.043 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 0.014 mg/mL hypoxanthine (Acros), 38.5 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.18% NaHCO3 (Cellgro), 0.20% Glucose (MP Biomedical), 0.003 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.2% Albumax (Gibco), 5% human serum) as previously described.14 Brieﬂy, cultures were maintained in 25 cm3 ﬂasks (Corning) at a volume of 10 mL and were gassed for 30 s with an environment of 3% CO2, 1% O2, and 96% N2, then incubated at 37 °C. The antimalarial activity was determined with a SYBR Green based parasite proliferation assay, adapted from Smilkstein15 and Bennett.16 Using this technique, the increase of parasite DNA contained in human red blood cells was measured after 72 h of incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds.17 Relative ﬂuorescence values were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM ﬂuorimeter (excitation 495 nm and emission 525 nm). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and plotted with SigmaPlot 10 (Systat). ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The 1H, HSQC, and HMBC NMR spectra of the compounds.

VIEIRA, ISAO KUBO* Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natwal Resomes, Uniwsity of Califmnia, Bn;bley, Califmnia 94720 HIROSHI KUJIME, YOSHIRO YAMAGIWA, and TADAO KAMIKAWA+ Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Tabnology, Kinki Unimity, Kowaka, Higasbiosaka-shi, Osaka 5 77, Japan ABSTRACT.-TWO novel acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [l] and cusculine [2], were iso- lated from the CH,CI, extract of the leaves ofAngostwapanirrrlataa (Rutaceae). Their structures were established as l-hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethoxy-9-acridone for 1 and 1,2,3,5,6-pen- tamethoxy-9-acridone for 2 by means of spectroscopic studies, in particular nmr. These struc- tural assignments were confirmed by synthesis, using a direct metallation method as a key reac- tion. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against an aquatic snail, B i a - phalaria glabratu, and cytotoxicity against several types of carcinoma cell lines. We have recently described the isolation of various alkloids from Brazilian Rutace- ous plants: two molluscicidal quinoline alkaloids from the leaves of Gafipeu brarteata (l), and two insect-growth-inhibitory 4-quinolinone alkaloids from the leaves of Esen- hkia feiocarpa (2). In our continuing search for biologically active phytochemicals, two novel acridone alkaloids have been isolated from the leaves of another Brazilian Rutace- ous plant, Angosturapanicufata (Engler) Elias. These alkaloids exhibited moderate mol- luscicidal and cytotoxic activities and were designated cuspanine El} and cusculine [21. Their structures were established based largely on nmr studies. However, the structures established are rather uncommon among the known acridone alkaloids. Therefore, in order to confirm the structures, their syntheses were carried out. This paper reports the isolation, structure determination, and syntheses of 1 and 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION After repeated and various column chromatographies, the CH,Cl, extract of the leaves ofA. panicufata yielded two new acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [I] and cusculine 121. In conjunction with both 'H- and ',C-nmr and eims data, the molecular formula C1,Hl,NO6 was assigned to cuspanine 111. In addition, together with the uv and ir data, an acridone-type structure could be assigned to cuspanine. This was apparent be- cause keto group signals, characteristic of acridone at 6 181.14 (s) and 1635 cm-', were observed. The presence of a free phenolic group was deduced from the uv spectrum by using AICI, as the shift reagent. Thus, when afew drops ofAIC1, solution was added to cuspanine in MeOH, a typical bathochromic shift was observed. However, the re- gion of 3000-3600 cm-' in the ir spectrum showed only weak and broad absorption, because the phenolic group forms a stable 6-membered ring intramolecular hydrogen bond with the keto group. The 'H-nmr spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic proton sig- nals at 6 6.92 and 8.06 ( J = 8.0 Hz for each) which can be attributed to H-7 and H-8, respectively (3). This indicated the tetrasubstituted nature of ring C. The remaining signal at 6 6.23 (s) could be attributed to the aromatic proton at either H-2 or H-4. This was confirmed by 'H nmr using nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY). In the NOESY spectrum of cuspanine, an nOe was observed between the aromatic proton H-4 at 6 6.23 and the amine proton at 6 8.44. This result, itself, was conclusive for the assignment of the remaining proton to the 4 position in ring C.

Therefore, the structure 1 was proposed for cuspanine. Cusculine E21 is very closely related to cuspanine Ill. The only difference observed in the 'H-nmr spectrum was an additional peak for an M e 0 group, suggesting the pres- ence of five M e 0 groups in the molecule. In addition to this observation, the batho- chromic shift observed in the uv spectrum of 1 was not detected with 2, indicating that an Me0 group was substituted for the phenolic group of 1. This was further supported by the 13C-nmr spectrum which showed three signals in lower field at 6 61.89, 61.53, and 60.94, indicating the presence of three hindered Me0 groups (4) and leading to structure 2 for cusculine. Cuspanine 121, 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone, was synthesized from 2- bromo-3,Cdimethoxybenzoic acid [6]. The first method that was tried for the prepara- tion of 6 was the bromination of isovanillin in refluxing CHCI,, followed by methyla- tion (Me,S04) and oxidation (Jones' reagent). However, the bromination gave a poor yield (18%), so the following alternate approach, using a directed metallation method, was adopted. 1114 Journal of Natural Products Wol. 55, No. 8 The methoxymethyl ether (MOM ether) 141, prepared from 3,4dimethoxybenzyl alcohol [3] and methoxymethyl chloride, was lithiated in Et,O with n-butyllithium at 0\". The resulting yellow precipitates were treated with 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane (5) at -78', and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature to give a bromide 5 with a 66% yield. Hydrolysis of the MOM ether of 5 with HBr in warm EtOH, fol- lowed by oxidation with Jones' reagent, gave 6 in a 69% yield. Ullmann condensation (6) of 6 and 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline [7l in the presence of freshly prepared copper powder and K,C03 in DMF gave 8 with a 56% yield appearing as orange plates. Treat- ment of 8 with polyphosphoric acid and xylene (7) at 150' gave 2 in the form of yellow prisms with a yield of 55%. Selective hydrolysis of the 1-MeO group of 2 was achieved by refluxing in MeOH with concentrated HCl and 70% HC104 to afford 1 (Scheme 1). The physical data for both 1 and 2 were identical with those of the natural products. The structure of 1 was unambiguously determined by a single crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 1). FIGURE 1. Molecular structure of 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acri- done [Z] from X-ray crystallography. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail Bimphakaria gkbrata. The LC5, of cuspanine fl] was 5 ppm and that of cusculine 121 was 20 ppm. There are only a few examples in the literature (8,9) where alkaloids exhibiting high toxicity to snails are observed. These two alkaloids also showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several carcinoma cell lines. The IC5,'s of 1 and 2 against HeIa epithelioid carcinoma cells were 2.5 and 8.5 pg/ml, respectively. In addition, they also inhibited the growth of BT-20 human breast carcinoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.-AII the pnxedures were the same as previously de- scribed (2). ISOLATION OF CONSTITUENTs.-The leaves ofA. pnicvhtu were collected in Minas erais, Brazil, in February 1988, and identified by Dr. Jd R. Pirani, Instituto de BiociEncias, Universidade de So Paulo, So Paulo, SP. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium ofthis institute. The dried pul- verized leaves were first extracted with CH2C12 followed by MeOH at ambient temperature. A subsequent molluscicidal bioassay using B . gkzbrata indicated the CH2CI, extract to be active. The CH2CI, extract (2.983 g) was chromatographed over Si gel, using CH,CI,, EtOAc, and MeOH. This process yielded 11 fractions. The bioactive fraction, eluted with EtOAc, was rechromatographed over Si gel (Lichroprep), af- fording c u s p i n e [l] (60 mg). The fractions eluted with MeOH after the same procedure gave cusculine 121 (200 mg).

CELL LINES AND MEDIA.-AII cell lines used for the assay were purchased from American Type Cul- ture Collection (Rockville, MD). They are HeLa ATCC CCL 2 19, epithelioid cerevix carcinoma from human, and BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma from human. Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-in- activated fetal calf serum, and incubated in a humidified atomosphere of 5% C02-95% air at 37\". These human monolayer cultures were subcultured with a 0.25% trypsidEDTA solution. CYTOTOXICITY ASSAY.-The cytotoxicity assays were performed by a microculture tetrazolium (h4YY) (Sigma) method (12). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtitre plates at 4@304000 celldwell, with various concentrations ofthe samples. After incubation, 50 pl MlT(3 mglml in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye ws solubilized by adding 100 pl DMSO to each well, fol- lowed by gentle shaking. The extinction ccef6cient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photome- ter Labsystems, at a wavelength of 620 run. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. Jd R.

The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. These compounds were tested against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Compound 2 exhibited cytotoxicity for HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia) and SF-245 (human glioblastoma) cells. Pterogyne nitens Tul. (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae), popularly known as “ba´lsamo”, “yvira-ro´”, “cocal”, and “amendoinzeiro”, is a native tree common in South America. It is used as an ornamental due to its attractive ﬂowers and fruits.1,2 Medicinal uses of this species have not been reported frequently, although aqueous preparations from stem bark have been used by local Paraguayan populations in the therapy of ascariasis.3 Previous phytochemical studies with the leaves and fruits of P. nitens have demonstrated the presence of several guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity toward the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against CHO Aux B1 cells,4 and phenolic compounds with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical- scavenging activities.5-7 In our continuing search for new natural product-based anticancer agents from Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest plants, and their associated microorganisms,8,9 the ethanol extract of P. nitens was selected for further investigation due to its cytotoxic activity in the MTT assay. This extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning, yielding a bioactive n-butanol-soluble fraction with IC50 60 µg/mL against HL-60 (leukemia) cells. The n-butanol fraction was chromatographed using silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 followed by RP-18 to afford ﬁve guanidine alkaloids (1-5). Nitensidine D (1) was isolated as colorless oil and gave an alkaloid-positive test when sprayed with Dragendorff’s and Sak- aguchi’s reagents. Additionally, evidence for a guanidine alkaloidal type came from its molecular formula, which was established as C11H21N3 by HRESIMS. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) exhibited typical resonances for a terpenoid moiety, due to the presence of three vinyl methyl signals at δ 1.55, 1.61, and 1.63, two oleﬁnic protons at δ 5.07 and 5.17, and three methylenes at δ 1.97, 2.03, and 3.63. These data were consistent with the presence of a geranyl moiety. Additionally, a broad singlet at δ 8.85 was observed, integrating for four hydrogens, which was compatible with two amino groups of a guanidine structure. The geranyl moiety was conﬁrmed from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1), due to signals at δ 130.9 and 138.3 (two quaternary oleﬁnic carbons), δ 119.6 and 123.8 (two methine oleﬁnic carbons), δ 38.5, 38.9, and 25.9 (three methylene carbons), and δ 16.0, 17.5, and 25.4 (three methyls). The guanidine moiety was also evident from the signal at δ 157.6, characteristic of an imine functionality (Table 1). These observations and additional NMR experiments (DEPT 135, gHMQC, gCOSY, NOESY, and gHMBC) allowed us to establish a guanidine alkaloid structure for 1, with the same structural pattern for those alkaloids previously reported.4 The isolate 1 was fully characterized as shown, and its structure was in agreement with a tautomeric form (Figure 1). This proposal was supported by the 1H NMR data, in particular, due to the multiplicity observed for the signal displayed by the allyl hydrogen (H-1′) of the geranyl moiety. This signal appeared as a clear doublet at δ 3.63 (2H, J ) 6.0 Hz), which is compatible with a guanidine nucleus geranylated at N-1. The natural guanidines occurring in plants or animals show a variety of substitution patterns, with most of these including the 4 Dedicated to Dr. G. I.

The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 (Table 1) indicated structural characteristics somewhat different from those of 1 and the other guanidines isolated previously from P. nitens.4 Considering that 2 possesses four unsaturations and showed positive Dragendorff’s and Sakaguchi’s tests, an alkaloid structure was deduced for this compound. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited the presence of a set of typical resonances at δ 5.52 (d, J ) 15.0 Hz), 5.81 (d, J ) 10.5 Hz), and 6.20 (dd, J ) 15.0, 10.5 Hz), characteristic of a sp2-conjugated system, which could be attributed to an E-diene unit based on the coupling constants shown for these hydrogens. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) showed resonances for three methine sp2 carbons at δ 135.4, 125.2, and 123.9 and for one quaternary sp2 carbon at δ 135.0. Additionally, both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed the presence of two vinyl methyl groups [δ 1.69 (18.0), 1.73 (25.5)] and a tertiary methyl group at δ 1.26 (27.6). These data revealed the presence of a C10 alkyl chain, which could be attributed to a monoterpene-type unit. The structural evidence from the spectroscopic data obtained allowed us to elucidate compound 2 with a guanidine alkaloid structure. Additionally, the mutually coupled methylenes [δ 1.61 (1H, m), 1.79 (1H, ddd, J ) 13.5, 4.0, 3.5 Hz), and 2.92 (1H, ddd, J ) 12.0, 14.0, 4 Hz), and δ 3.15 (1H, ddd, J ) 12.0, 4.0, 3.5 Hz)] would be compatible with a cyclic guanidine structure for 2. Indeed, this proposal was conﬁrmed from the gHMBC spectrum. The location of the methyl group C-10′ was assigned at C-3′ due to the observed gHMBC correlations between the methyl protons at H-10′ and C-2′, C-3′, and C-4′. Further, gHMBC cross-peaks between H-4′ and C-2′, C-10′, C-6′; H-1′ and C-2, C-3′; H-2′ and C-10′, C-4′; and H-6′ and C-8′, C-9′ completed the assignment of a cyclic guanidine-type alkaloid and its substit- uents. Also, a C10 alkyl chain composed of an E-diene unit was conﬁrmed through NOESY correlations observed for H-4′ and H-6′. The conformation adopted by this molecule was evaluated in a preliminary manner employing semiempirical calculations (Hamil- tonian as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G**), and a plausible conformation obtained for compound 2 with the methyl group at C-3′ in the -position is shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information. In Figure S2 (Supporting Information) we show a biogenetic proposal for the formation of the new guanidine derivatives 1 and 2. In addition to 1 and 2, three known compounds were isolated and identiﬁed as pterogynine10 (3), pterogynidine4 (4), and ga- legine11 (5). Compound 5 was ﬁrst isolated from Verbesina enceloiodes (Asteraceae) and later identiﬁed as a toxic and antidiabetic component from Galega ofﬁcinalis (Goat’s Rue).12 Galegine was a template for the design of metformin and other biguanide-type hypoglycemic drugs.13 The identiﬁcation of com- pounds 3-5 was based on 1H and 13C NMR and MS data analysis and by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory.4,10,11 Although a broad spectrum of biological activities has been described for guanidine alkaloids belonging to marine sources, few studies were reported from higher plants and of the potential anticancer activity of this class of natural products.14-16 All isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity, using a MTT assay, evidencing a key role of the prenyl substitution pattern in the level of activity. The cytotoxic activity of compounds 1-5 was evaluated in Vitro against HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma). Mean concentration inhibitory (IC50) values were determined using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol, with slight modiﬁcations, and the results are shown in Table 2. In human cells, nitensidine E (2) was the most active compound, showing activity for the different cell lines (Table 2). Therefore, guanidine alkaloids 2 may be useful as a prototype compound for the development of new antineoplastic drugs. Further work to evaluate the mechanism of action of the guanidine alkaloids characterized in this study is currently in progress. The structural features of nitensidines D (1) and E (2) appear less common than the guanidine alkaloids already reported from other higher plants. It is noteworthy that the majority of these alkaloids contain isoprenyl groups. Only one alkaloid having a similar geranyl side chain has been previously isolated from Fontainea pancheri (Euphorbiaceae).17 In some cases, the isopen- tenyl groups have undergone cyclization to produce hexahydroimi- dazo-pyrimidines, typical of Alchornea species (Euphorbiaceae).18,19 The structure of nitensidine E (2) constitutes the ﬁrst report of the Table 1. 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (125 MHz), and gHMBC Data for Compounds 1 and 2 in DMSO-d6 nitensidine D (1) nitensidine E (2) position δC, mult. δH J in Hz) gHMBC δC, mult. δH J in Hz) gHMBC 2 157.6, qC 1′ 154.1, qC 1′ 3 8.85, brs 7.98, brs 4 8.85, brs 7.68, brs 1′ 38.5, CH2 3.63, d (6.0) 2′ 35.1, CH2 2.92, ddd (12, 14, 4); 3.15, ddd (12, 4, 3.5) 2′ 119.6, CH 5.17, t (6.0) 1′, 4′, 10′ 31.9, CH2 1.61, m; 1.79, ddd (13.5, 4, 3.5) 4′, 10′ 3′ 138.3, qC 1′, 4′, 5′, 10′ 52.4, qC 1′, 4′, 5′, 10′ 4′ 38.9, CH2 1.97, m 5′, 10′ 135.4, CH 5.52, d (15.0) 2′, 10′ 5′ 25.9, CH2 2.03, m 4′ 125.2, CH 6.20, dd (15.0, 10.5) 6′ 123.8, CH 5.07, t (7.0) 4′, 5′, 8′, 9′ 123.9, CH 5.81, d (10.5) 4′, 8′, 9′ 7′ 130.9, qC 5′, 8′, 9′ 135.0, qC 5′, 8′, 9′ 8′ 17.5, CH3 1.55, s 6′, 9′ 18.0, CH3 1.69, s 6′, 9′ 9′ 25.4, CH3 1.63, s 8′, 9′ 25.5, CH3 1.73, s 6′, 8′ 10′ 16.0, CH3 1.61, s 2′, 4′ 27.6, CH3 1.26, s 2′, 4′ Figure 1.

To date, the isolation and characterization of prenylated guanidine alkaloids has been reported only within a limited number of plant genera.20-23 Furthermore, terpenoid-like alkaloids may have some taxonomic signiﬁcance for Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae, since their occurrence is most common among these taxa. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT 90°, and DEPT 135°) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using DMSO-d6 as an internal standard. Positive-ion high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an HRMS ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics). IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 FT- IR spectrometer using KBr disks. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). Column chromatography was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was per- formed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 °C, as well as by using Dragendorff’s and Sakaguchi’s reagents. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm × 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden. Plant Material. Pterogyne nitens leaves were collected at the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil). Extraction and Isolation. The shade-dried leaves (2.8 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with hexane (2.0 L × 5, at room temperature, for ﬁve weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macera- tion with ethanol (4.0 L × 5) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (<40 °C) to yield 12.7 g of a syrup. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH-H2O (4:1) (3.5 L) and partitioned successively with EtOAc (5.0 L × 3) and n-butanol (5.0 L × 3). After removal of the solvent 3.7 and 5.9 g of extract were afforded, respectively. The n-butanol residue was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sephadex LH-20 (2.5 g) in methanol to afford nine fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC visualized with Sakaguchi’s24 and Dragendorff’s reagents, to yield an alkaloidal fraction (587 mg). Separation of this fraction on reversed-phase silica gel column chromatography (RP-18) by elution with increasing amounts of MeCN in H2O afforded eight fractions (ALK-1-ALK- 8) and guanidine 5 (18 mg). Fraction ALK-3 (121 mg) was subjected to repeated column chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluted with CHCl3-MeOH mixtures (ranging from 0 to 35% MeOH), to furnish the isoprenylated alkaloids 3 (27 mg) and 4 (12 mg). Fraction ALK-7 (62 mg) was further puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (16:84:0.01), UV detection at 235 nm; ﬂow rate 13 mL/min], affording the new geranylated alkaloids 1 (22 mg) and 2 (11 mg). Nitensidine D (1): colorless oil; IR (KBr) νmax 1652, 1618, 1012, 845 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMS m/z 196.3052 [M + H]+ (calcd for C11H22N3, 196.3063). Nitensidine E (2): colorless oil; [R]25D +140.0 (c 0.01, MeOH); IR (KBr) νmax 1649, 1618, 1093, 839 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMS m/z 194.2900 [M + H]+ (calcd for C11H20N3, 194.2888). Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the guanidine alkaloids 1-5 was tested against four tumor cell lines: HL-60 (human leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 × 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 µL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 µg/mL) dissolved in DMSO (5%) were added to each well and incubated for three days. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 µg/mL) was used as positive control. Growth of tumor cells was quantiﬁed by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan product. At the end of 72 h incubation, the medium in each well was replaced by fresh medium (200 µL) containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product of MTT reduction was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (Spectra Count, Packard, Ontario, Canada). Drug effect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of control absorbance of reduced dye at 590 nm. The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Institutive Software for Science, San Diego).25 Acknowledgment.

Box 4009, 01061-970, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil ReceiVed October 12, 2009 Two unusual pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2), were isolated from the leaves of Senna multijuga, together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin. The structures of the new alkaloids were established on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, in comparison with the standard compound physostigmine. Senna multijuga (Rich.) Irwin et Barneby (syn. Cassia multijuga Rich.) (Fabaceae) is a medium-size evergreen tree distributed widely in several Brazilian regions and other biomes from Africa.1 Several chemical studies of seeds, leaves, and roots have shown the occurrence of ﬂavonoids,2 anthraquinones,3,4 polysaccharides,5 and chromones.6 In Brazil, this species is popularly known as “pau- cigarra”, “caquera”, “topeiuia”, “aleluia”, and “canafı´stula” and is used as an ornamental plant in several regions of the country due to its attractive yellow ﬂowers.1,7 Although some species of the Senna (Cassia) genus have been reported to be an important source of phenolic compounds with diverse biological and pharmacological properties,8 only the seeds of S. multijuga are used for the treatment of ophthalmic and skin infections.2 However, no phytochemical study on the isolation of the secondary metabolites of this species has been conducted previously. As part of our ongoing research on Atlantic Forest plant species,9 we selected S. multijuga for study. From an ethanolic extract of the leaves were isolated two new pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′- multijuguinone (2), together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin.10 The occurrence of 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine alkaloids is unusual, and only one report has been described in the literature.11 Herein, we present the isolation, structure elucidation, and acetyl- cholinesterase-inhibitory properties of 1 and 2 by bioautography and microplate screening assays. The ﬁrst Dragendorff-positive compound, 7′-multijuguinone (1), was isolated as a white solid, mp 103-105 °C. The molecular weight of 1 was measured by HRESITOFMS, and the molecular formula was established as C18H29NO2, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5. The observed pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ was calculated for C18H30NO2, 292.2271. The UV spectrum, with absorption maxima at 222 and 287 nm, suggested the presence of a ketone and substituted aromatic moiety chro- mophores, respectively. IR absorption bands were assigned to hydroxy (3401 cm-1), carbonyl (1701 cm-1), and pyridine ring (1578, 1498, and 1464 cm-1) functional groups. Examination of the 1H, 13C, and DEPT NMR spectra recorded in CDCl3 (Table 1) showed the presence of a 2,3,6-trisubstituted pyridine ring [δ 7.00 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4), 6.84 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5); δ 145.3 (C-2), 148.8 (C-3), 122.7 (C-4), 120.8 (C-5), and 152.9 (C-6)], two methyl groups at δ 0.88 (t, H-12′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 13.9) and 2.47 (s, H-7, δC 18.5), and 10 methylenes at δ 2.67 (t, H-1′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 37.0), 1.64 (qt, H-2′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 30.2), 1.30 (m, H-3′, H-4′, and H-11′, δC 29.1, 29.0, and 22.4), 1.55 (qt, H-5′ and H-9′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 23.8 and 23.5), 2.36 (t, H-6′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.7), 2.37 (t, H-8′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.8), and 1.27 (m, H-10′, δC 31.4) and suggested the presence of a long linear side chain in the structure of 1. Furthermore, the side chain from C-1′ to C-12′ was deduced as being attached at C-6 of the pyridine nucleus by a gHMBC NMR experiment. Three-bond correlations were observed from H-5 to C-1′, H-1′ to C-5, and H-2′ to C-6 (Figure 1), supporting a 2-methyl- 3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine substitution pattern. The 7′-oxodode- cyl unit linked at C-6 is different from the long-chain pattern observed for other piperidine and pyridine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species. The position of the 7′-oxo group on the straight side chain was also deﬁned by gHMBC data analysis, for which the main correlations are represented in Figure 1.

J. Nat. Prod. 2010, 73, 482–484 482 10.1021/np900644x 2010 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 12/14/2009 correlations with H-2′-H-6′ and H-8′-H-12′, respectively. HO- MODEC experiments were carried out decoupling H-2′ (δ 1.64), which enabled the loss of multiplicity from the neighboring H-1′ and H-3′ (overlapped with H-4′). When H-5′ was decoupled, loss of multiplicity was observed for H-6′ and H-4′ (overlapped with H-3′), supporting the same chemical shift for H-3′ and H-4′. The same pattern was observed with H-10′ and H-11′ when H-9′ and H-12′ were decoupled. The interpretation of these gHMBC sequence cross-peaks led to the establishment of the oxo function at the C-7′ position in the side chain. Furthermore, the gHMBC correlations of H-5 with C-3 (3J) and C-1′ (3J), together with that from H-7 to C-2 (2J) and C-3 (3J), allowed the hydroxy group to be located at C-3, which was consistent with a previous study on bioactive piperidine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species, with features similar to 1.9 Additionally, the gHMBC (1H-15N) spectrum showed a correlation between the nitrogen signal at δ 308.8 and signals at δ 2.67 (H-1′), 6.84 (H-5), and 2.47 (H-7). All this evidence agreed with the hydroxy group being located at C-3 and conﬁrmed the assumption made on the substitution pattern in pyridine alkaloid 1, which must be 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxododecyl) pyridine, similar to those found for piperidine alkaloids from other Senna (Cassia) species, except for the ketone group position in the side chain. These results suggested that the hydroxy group of this pyridine alkaloid is at C-3, which is not in agreement with those previously reported for a similar pyridine alkaloid from this species, with no hydroxy group being located at C-5.5 Compound 2 was obtained as a white solid, mp 71-73 °C, and gave a positive test with Dragendorff reagent. This compound showed spectroscopic features very similar to those of 1. The HRESITOFMS for 2 exhibited a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220), appropriate for the molecular formula C18H29NO3, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5 and being 16 mass units more than that of 1. The IR spectrum revealed the carbonyl absorption band at 1703 cm-1, a pyridine ring at 1584, 1489, and 1464 cm-1, and a hydroxy group band at 3392 cm-1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 showed signals very close to those of 1 (Table 1), as in the 1H NMR spectrum, which demonstrates the presence of a substituted pyridine ring system at δ 7.02 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4) and 6.85 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5). Additionally, the methyl hydrogens of CH3-7 at δ 2.48, analyzed together with 13C NMR data, conﬁrmed that the pyridine moiety is similar to that of 1. However, differences were evident between these compounds since the methyl group (CH3-12′) located in the side chain of 1 was replaced with a hydroxy methylene group in 2 at δ 3.67 (2H, t, J ) 6.5, H-12′, δC 62.5). These data, supported by the 13C NMR, DEPT, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY, and HOMODEC spectra, were in agreement with a pyridine system bearing one hydroxy group, one methyl, and one long-chain substituent. According to these data, the structure of 2 was determined as 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxo-12′-hydroxy- dodecyl)pyridine. All compounds isolated were screened for their AChE inhibitory activity, using bioautography and microplate tests, and the results are shown in Table 2. The preliminary TLC assay suggested moderate activity for compounds 1 and 2, which showed the minimum amounts of these alkaloids required for AChE inhibition of 0.75 and 0.18 µg, respectively, when compared with physostigmine (positive control, 0.05 µg). Rutin proved to be inactive, since the minimum amount required to show activity was over 100 µg. In addition, the microplate test conﬁrmed activity of the compounds 1 and 2, which exhibited weak AChE inhibition of 13% and 30% at 350 mM. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were recorded on a digital Microquimica MQAPF-302 apparatus and are uncorrected. UV data were acquired using an Amersham Ultrospec 2100 pro UV/ vis spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS10 FT- IR spectrometer coupled with an ATR accessory (the samples were pressed against a crystal of Ge). The 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT, NOESY, TOCSY, and HOMODEC) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, gH- MBC, and 1H-15N gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) at 30 °C and referenced using TMS (δTMS ) 0.00) as internal standard or residual solvent resonances of CDCl3 at δ 7.26 and 77.0 ppm, respectively, for 1H and 13C. High-resolution mass spectra with electrospray ionization were measured on an ultrOTOFQ (Bruker Daltonics) operating in positive mode. MeOH-H2O (4:1) was used as solvent system. TLC was performed on silica gel F254 plates (0.20 mm, Fluka), and spots were visualized under UV light (254 and 366 nm) and spraying with Dragendorff’s reagent or anisaldehyde-H2SO4, followed by charring for 5 min. Preparative TLC was carried out with Analtech 500 µm thick silica gel GF plates (20 × 20 cm, Uniplate) and visualized under UV light at 366 nm. Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) ProStar system equipped with a ternary pump model 340, a photodiode array detector model 330, and an autosampler model 410, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.52 software. Preparative HPLC separation was performed on a Varian PrepStar system equipped with a UV-vis detector model 320 and a binary pump model SD-1 manual injector, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.51 software. The columns used were a Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 4.60 mm, 5 µm) and a preparative Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 21.20 mm, 10 µm) protected by corresponding guard columns. All solvents used in the experimental procedures were distilled previously. For chromatographic analysis, HPLC-grade solvents (J. T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico) were employed. Water was puriﬁed immediately prior to use with a Milli Q plus system (Millipore, Milford, MA). Plant Material. Leaves of S. multijuga were collected in Araraquara (Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in July 2008 by one of the authors (M.P.). The plant was identiﬁed by Ineˆs Cordeiro from the Institute of Botany in Sa˜o Paulo-SP, Brazil. A voucher specimen (SP 384103) has been deposited in the herbarium of this institute. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered leaves (2.7 kg) were extracted with ethanol (8 L × 4) for ﬁve days at room temperature. Figure 1. Key gHMBC correlations for 1 and 2. Table 2.

Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 3 483 The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation, yielding a thick syrup (210 g). The crude ethanol extract (100 g) was further reconstituted in MeOH-H2O (4:1), ﬁltered, and then partitioned with n-hexane (250 mL × 5), CH2Cl2 (250 mL × 4), EtOAc (250 mL × 4), and n-BuOH (250 mL × 2), successively. All phases were concentrated under reduced pressure. The CH2Cl2 fraction (15.9 g) was dissolved in 500 mL of 5% HCl aqueous solution (ca. pH 2), ﬁltered, and partitioned with EtOAc (50 mL × 3) to remove nonbasic components. Then, NH4OH (30%) was added to the aqueous phase until ca. pH 8.5 and partitioned with CH2Cl2 (50 mL × 5). The latter organic layer was washed with H2O (100 mL × 3) and concentrated in order to give a neutral alkaloidal fraction (457 mg), which was puriﬁed by using preparative TLC with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc (1.5: 2.0:6.5) as developing solvent (×2). The bands with Rf values of 0.50 and 0.18 were scraped and eluted with MeOH, affording pure compounds 1 (49.1 mg) and 2 (60.5 mg). Fraction EtOAc (2.20 g) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (5:95 to 100:0) to yield six fractions (EtOAc-F1 to EtOAc- F6). Fractions EtOAc-F2 and EtOAc-F3 (527 mg) were further puriﬁed by preparative HPLC on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (40:60, ﬂow rate 19 mL/min, UV 254 nm), affording compound 3 (tR 17.4 min, 42.0 mg). Bioautographic Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of pure compounds was determined using a TLC bioautographic assay as previously described.12 The TLC layers were spotted with 1 and 2 in a range from 0.09 to 6.00 µg developed with n-hexane-EtOAc (1:4, v/v) and subsequently dried. The plates were then sprayed with the enzyme solution (6.66 U/mL), thoroughly dried, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min (moist atmosphere). Enzyme activity was detected by spraying with a solution consisting of 0.25% of 1-naphthyl acetate in EtOH plus 0.25% aqueous solution of Fast Blue B salt. Potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appeared as clear zones on a purple- colored background. Electric eel AChE type V (product no. C 2888, 1000 U) and the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Microplate Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of compounds 1-3 was evaluated using the modiﬁed methods of Ellman et al. and Rhee et al. in a 96-well microplate, as previously described.13 Using this method, the enzyme hydrolyzes the substrate acetylthiocholine, resulting in the production of thiocholine, which reacts with 5,5′-dithiobis(2- nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate-5-mercaptothio- choline and 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate and can be detected at 405 nm. To the 96-well plates were added 25 µL of an aqueous solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (15 mM), 125 µL of DTNB (3 mM) in buffer C, 50 µL of buffer B, and 25 µL of sample diluted in buffer A, to give a range of concentrations from 0.78 to 100 µg/mL. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s three times. Furthermore, 25 µL of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme was added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min two times. Any increase in absorbance due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the rate of the reaction before the addition of the enzyme from the rate of the enzyme reaction. The percentage of inhibition was calculated in comparison to a blank (10% MeOH in buffer A), and a positive control of physostigmine was used in the same range of concentrations. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8); buffer B, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction; buffer C, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.10 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2·6H2O. All of the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 7′-Multijuguinone (1): white solid; mp 103-105 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR νmax 3401, 2919, 2849, 1701, 1578, 1498, 1464, 1285, 1164, 1130, 832, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRESITOFMS m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO2, 292.2271); TLC Rf 0.50 (1.5:2.0:6.5 n-hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc). 12′-Hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2): white solid; mp 71-73 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR (ﬁlm) νmax 3392, 2931, 2851, 1703, 1584, 1489, 1464, 1290, 1248, 1160, 1128, 1048, 827, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRES- ITOFMS m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220); TLC Rf 0.18 (1.5:2:6.5 n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc).

Their cytotoxic activities against Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay at several concentrations for 24 h. Activities could be observed for egonol against C6 (IC50 ¼ 3.2 mg/mL) and Hep-2 (IC50 ¼ 3.6 mg/mL) cell lines, and for homoegonol against C6 (IC50 ¼ 4.9 mg/mL) and HeLa (IC50 ¼ 5.3 mg/mL) cells. Keywords: Styrax camporum; Styracaceae; Cytotoxic lignans; MTT assay 1. Introduction Styrax camporum Pohl (Styracaceae), known in Brazil as ‘‘estoraque do campo’’ or ‘‘cuia de brejo’’, grows in the States of Sa˜ o Paulo and Minas Gerais and is popularly used in gastrointestinal diseases [1]. Its reported uses have led to a study of the composition and antiulcer activity of the crude extract of the bark and the trunk [2]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the bark of S. camporum has resulted in the isolation of homoegonol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, sitosterol, vanillin and esters of cinnamic and ferulic acids [3]. The present article deals with the isolation from stems of S. camporum, and the identification and cytotoxicity evaluation of two benzofuran lignans, egonol (1) and homoegonol (2), and one furofuran lignan, ()syringaresinol (3), *Corresponding author.

Lignans are known to possess several biological activities [7–11], including antitumor, e.g., some podophyllotoxin derivatives, currently in clinical use, and cytotoxic, e.g., the benzofuran lignan licarin A which is active against KB cells. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compounds 1–3 against C6, Hep-2 and HeLa human carcinoma cells, the MTT spectrophotometric assay was used. 2. Experimental 2.1. Plant material The stems of S. camporum Pohl were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guac¸ u, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen (Young 07 – SP) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil. 2.2. General experimental procedures Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. 1H, 13C-NMR, DEPT and COSY spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-D6 using TMS as internal standard on a Bruker AC 200 or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS, on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. CC was performed over silica gel 60, 70–230 or 230–400 mesh or Sephadex LH-20 (Merck). TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates with detection pro- vided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and/or by spraying with 2% anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating. 2.3. Extraction and isolation The dried and powdered stems of S. camporum (470.0 g) were extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue (57.2 g) was taken up in aqueous MeOH (MeOH–H2O 80 : 20; 200 mL) and subsequently extracted with hexane. Sufficient water was added to the aqueous methanol fraction to make it up to 60% aqueous MeOH, which was extracted with CHCl3 followed by EtOAc. The CHCl3 fraction (3.8 g) was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane–EtOAc 1 : 1 v/v (A), CHCl3 (B), EtOAc (C), CHCl3–CH3OH 1 : 1 v/v (D), MeOH (E) and H2O (F) (300 mL each). After evaporation, fraction A (370 mg) was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl3–MeOH (98 : 2) and 62 fractions (15 mL each) were collected. Combined fraction 6–15 afforded 1 (34.3 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.26) and the combined fraction 17–18 afforded 2 (11.7 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 96 : 4, Rf 0.50). Fraction C (630 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 19 fractions (10 mL each) were collected. Combined fractions 2–7 (363 mg) were rechromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 52 fractions (3 mL each) were collected. Purification of the combined fractions 31–41 (98 mg) by prep. TLC (eluent CHCl3–MeOH 92 : 8) yielded 3 (5.1 mg, CHCl3–MeOH 320 H.L. Teles et al. Downloaded by [University of California Santa Cruz] at 17:19 28 November 2014 85 : 15, Rf 0.61). All known compounds were identified with the help of UV, IR, MS and NMR, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. 2.4. Cytotoxicity assay Cellular viability in the presence and absence of test compounds was determined using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, Dorset, U.K.) microculture assay [12]. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase reduces MTT to a blue formazan product with an absorbance at 560 nm in DMSO. Cells harvested in the log phase of the growth were counted and seeded (5 104 cells/well in 1 mL) in 48-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37C under 4.3% CO2 to allow cell attachment, cultures of the Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were treated with several test compound concentrations. Three replicate wells were set up for each experimental condition. After another 24 h incubation period, MTT (100 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution) was added, the plate was incubated for 3 h and unreduced MTT was removed. Acid isopropanol (HCl 0.3%; 100 mL) was added to dissolve the blue formazan. The absorbance at 560 nm was read by using a Pharmacia LKB-Ultrospec III spectrophotometer. The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of test compound O HO OR2 OR1 OMe 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1' 6' 1'' 2'' 3'' 1 2 -CH2- Me Me R1 R2 O O OMe OMe HO OH OMe MeO 3 1 4 7 9 1' 4' 7' 9' Cytotoxic lignans from the stems of S. camporum 321 Downloaded by [University of California Santa Cruz] at 17:19 28 November 2014 resulting in a 50% reduction of absorbance compared to untreated cells in the MTT assay. Absorbances taken from cells grown in the absence of drugs were taken as 100% cell survival (control). For each compound the percent viability was plotted against concentration and the IC50 (concentration required to reduce viability by 50%) values were calculated for the three cell lines. This experiment was also performed with a positive control anticancer agent: streptonigrin. 3. Results and discussion The isolated lignans: egonol, homoegonol and () syringaresinol were evaluated for their cytotoxicities by the MTT method in the three cell lines: Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma). Each compound was tested at five different concentrations. The concentration–response curves thus generated were used to calculate the IC50 (table 1). The cytotoxic activity was expressed in terms of relative absorbance of drug-treated cells, in comparison to control cells. The results show a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect relationship for all the lignans and all the cell lines evaluated. Significant activities (IC50<10 mg/mL) could be observed for egonol against C6 and Hep-2 cell lines and for homoegonol against C6 and HeLa cells, when compared to the positive control streptonigrin activity (table 1). The activity of egonol against HeLa cells, homoegonol against Hep-2 cells as well as the activity of syringaresinol, the only furofuran neolignan under investigation in this study towards the three cell lines were moderate. It is interesting to note the significant differences of activity related to the lignan structure.

Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene isolated from the ethanolic leaf extract of C.sylvestris. The aim of the study was to assess the capacity of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris leaves and caseargrewiin F to protect DNA and verify if both the compounds cause some DNA damage, using the micronu- cleus (MN) test and comet assay in mice. Balb-C mice were treated with the extract [3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)] and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 14 days. On day 15, DNA damage was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of cyclophosphamide (CP) (i.p.) at 50 mg/kg b.w. after the MN test and comet assay were performed. A protective effect of ethanolic extract was observed in MN test (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg b.w.) and the comet assay (3.13 and 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F showed protective effect at 0.63, 1.3 and 2.5 mg/kg b.w. only in comet assay. We also tested the ability of compounds of C.sylvestris to induce MN and to increase the comet assay tail moment. The experimental design was similar to the DNA protection assay except that in test groups we omitted the CP challenge. We observed increased damage at 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F at 3.18 mg/kg b.w. in both the MN test and comet assay. We conclude that ethanolic extract of C. sylvestris and case- argrewiin F can protect cells against DNA damage induced by CP at low concentrations, but at high concentrations these compounds also induce DNA damage. Introduction Medicinal herbs have long been used in medical treatment and are still the sole remedy against several diseases in many parts of the world (1). Also, many natural products present in fruits, beverages and vegetables may be regarded as protective or even anti-proliferation agents for several types of human cancer (2). Some Brazilian natural products, including those that are isolated from Casearia sylvestris, are used in folk medicine, despite their potential toxicity. C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) (3) is a tree widely distributed in Brazil, from Amapa´ in the north down to Rio Grande do Sul and it is found in a variety of ecosystems from the savannah-like the Cerrado to the tropical Atlantic Rain forest and the equatorial Amazon forest. Moreover, it has also been found in Mexico and the Antilles (4). Casearia sylvestris is commonly known as ‘guacxatonga’ and used widely for its anti-inﬂammatory and anti-ulcerative activities (4–6) as well as its cytotoxic activity against malignant tumour cells (7). In addition, the bark of C.sylvestris has been used against fever and for treatment of herpes virus and diarrhoea (8). Phytochemical investigations revealed that the major compounds isolated from C.sylvestris exhibited both cytotoxic and anti-fungal activities (7). Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene, found in plants of the Casearia genus, described as a colourless and amorphous solid (9). While caseargrewiin F was not shown to be cytotoxic to human epidermoid carcinoma in the mouth, it exhibited cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and human small cell lung cancer. In the present study, caseargrewiin F was isolated from the leaves of C.sylvestris. In order to complement the studies of biological activity of compounds isolated from C.sylvestris, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the ethanolic extract of leaves of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protect cells against DNA-induced damage or induce DNA damage by theirselves, using the micronucleus (MN) test and comet assay in Balb- C mice. Materials and methods Plant material and preparation of extract Leaves of C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) were collected at the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (Sa˜o Miguel Arcanjo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herbarium ‘Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann’ (Instituto Botaˆnico do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identiﬁed by Dr Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris (20.5 kg) were extracted with ethanol (ca. 200 litre) in a stainless steel extractor with solvent re-circulation for ca. 24 h at 40C. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotaevaporator) and dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield 1.5 kg of dry residue. Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The identiﬁcation of compounds in ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was carried out in Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, by Andre Gonzaga dos Santos. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The sample was dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure, dissolved in 4.0 ml of methanol and ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a high performance liquid chroma- tography (HPLC) vial. The reference standard used in this work—caseargrewiin F and casearin U—was puriﬁed and identiﬁed in the laboratories of Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, Araraquara, Brazil; for details see Santos et al. (10). The standard solutions were prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of caseargrewiin F into a volumetric ﬂask. After diluting with methanol, the standard solutions (0.0079, 0.0159, 0.0635, 0.2540 e 0.5080 mg/ml) were ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a HPLC vial before injections. Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Varian ProStar system (comprising a model 240 pump, a 410 autosampler and a 330 photodiode array detector), with control and data handling managed by Star Chromatography software. Analysis was conducted using a Phenom- enex Gemini C-18 column (250 4.6 mm, 5 lm) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile: methanol: water (from 44:22:34 to 47:53:00, v/v/v, in 42 min) and acetonitrile: methanol (53:47, v/v, in 5 min); ﬂow rate 0.8 ml/min; detection range 210–400 nm; injection volume 20 ll. Analysis was realized in triplicate. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis A 5.0 mg of dried extract was submitted to SPE (2 1 cm) from silica gel (60– 200 lm; Merck): activated charcoal (Synth) (1:1, w/w) eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate (95:05, v/v, 5.0 ml). The sample was dried and diluted in hexane to afford 1.0 mg/ml solution. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chromatograph with ﬂame ionization detector using a DB-5 column (30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 lm). The carrier gas was He at a ﬂow rate of 1.33 ml/min, split mode with ratio of 1:20 and injection volume of 1 ll. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 250C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 60C, with an increase of 3C/min, to 240C. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis analysis was conducted using the same system and conditions interfaced to a mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an ion trap detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The compounds were identiﬁed by their retention indexes, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes (11) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7.0 library and of the literature (11). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis Dried extract was diluted in CDCl3 (50.0 mg/ml) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA 500 11.4 T instrument with CHCl3 as internal standard. Ethanolic extract emulsions The ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was dissolved in Tween 20 (20%). Balb-C male mice were treated with 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. The concentrations of the test were chosen based on the high solubility of the ethanolic extract in the Tween 20 (20%). Puriﬁcation and structure determination of caseargrewiin F Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris were extracted by steeping in ethanol. The dried extract obtained was separated by SPE on silica gel: activated charcoal and fraction SPE2 was separated further by normal-phase low-pressure column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. Fractions CC15-19 were puriﬁed by preparative reversed-phase (C18) HPLC to yield caseargrewiin F (850.0 mg). The structure of the compound was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. For details see Santos et al. (10). The chromatographic purity of the caseargrewiin F in the assays used was 98.6% (HPLC-UV detected at 235 nm). Caseargrewiin F emulsions Caseargrewiin F (Figure 1) was emulsiﬁed in 6% Tween 80 for both assays in mice. The Balb-C male mice were treated with 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg of caseargrewiin F per kg body weight (b.w.). These concentrations were based on ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris in which doses of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. were used; since caseargrewiin F represents 4% of the ethanolic extract, we selected doses that are 4% of the ethanolic extract doses. Animals Six-week-old Balb-C male mice were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (22 2C) and humidity (55 10% room humidity), in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized for 1 week, during which they had free access to a commercial diet (Purina) and water. The study was conduced with approval of Brazilian Ethics Commitee to Experimentation Animals (process CEP/FCF/CAr n 01/2006). Mutagenic chemical–Positive control Cyclophosphamide (CP, Sigma–Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, Lot. No. 036K1225, purity 99%) was used as mutagenic agent in experiments. CP was diluted in 0.9% NaCl just before use and the animals were exposed to the chemical by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg b.w. in 0.3 ml. Mutagenicity—MN test Experimental design The assays were performed using eight animals/group. Group 1 (negative control) mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection of 0.3 ml. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and was treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%), 0.6 ml by gavage, for 2 weeks and on day 15 the mice were injected i.p. with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl. Groups 4–9 were treated for 2 weeks by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with various concentrations of ethanolic extract (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) or caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.). These groups also received treatment with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl by i.p on day 15. Bone marrow from each animal was collected 24 h after the last administration (12). The bone marrow MN test was carried out as described by Schmid (13). All slides were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and coded to avoid observer bias. For each experimental point, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were scored to determine the percentages of micronucleated PCE. The ratio of PCEs to normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) (PCEs/NCEs) was determined in 200 cells. Genotoxicity—comet assay For the comet assay, the experimental design was the same as for the MN test in mice. Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized capillary vials and kept on ice until use. The alkaline version of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) was performed as described by Singh (14). Brieﬂy, 20 ll of blood was taken, homogenized with low-melting point agarose, spread on microscope slide pre-coated with normal melting point agarose and covered with a coverslip. After 5 min at 4C, the coverslip was removed from slides and they were immersed in cold lysing solution (2.4 M NaCl; 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); 10 mM Tris, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 1% Triton-X, pH 10) for 24 h. After lysis, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber, covered with electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH plus 1 mM EDTA, pH .13) and left for 20 min for the DNA to unwind. The electrophoresis was run for 20 min (25 V and 300 mA), after which the slides were submerged for 15 min in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) and ﬁxed in 96% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were prepared in duplicate with ethidium bromide and 50 cells were screened per sample in a ﬂuorescent microscope (ZEISS, Germany) equipped with an excitation ﬁlter of 515–560 nm, a barrier ﬁlter of 590 nm and a 40 objective. The level of Fig. 1. Chemical structure of caseargrewiin F. A. M. de Oliveira et al. 502 DNA damage was assessed by an image analysis system (TriTek CometScore 1.5, 2006) and the percentage of DNA in tail was obtained. Antimutagenicity—MN test Experimental design In Group 1 (negative control), mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and were treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with 0.6 ml Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%) by gavage, for 2 weeks, and on day 15 received CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.); the aim of this group is to ensure that Tween has no inﬂuence in possible DNA protective effect. Groups 4–9 were treated by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with solutions of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 2 weeks and, on day 15, CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p) was administered. Bone marrow was taken 24 h of CP after the injection (12). The MN test was performed as described previously for the mutagenicity assays. Antigenotoxicity—comet assay The experimental design for the Comet assay was the same as for antimutagenicity MN test and the comet assay for antigenotoxicity was carried out as described for the genotoxicity assay. Recently, Collins et al. (15) described that when comet assay is performed in in vivo experiments low concentrations of genotoxic agents are unlikely to induce signiﬁcant cytotoxicity, they also afﬁrm that a low comet assay DNA damage would be a better indicator that cells are alive than common cytotoxicity tests. In this context, to the comet assay we did not performed cytotoxicity test once at low concentrations, the compounds were not genotoxic and consequently did not present cytotoxicity that could inﬂuence in antigenotoxicity assay. Statistical analysis For a statistical interpretation, results were analyzed with Sigma Stat 3.5, Systat, CA. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test data for normal distribution, in all assays performed in the study. Since the results did not a show normal distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. In mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays, the Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare DNA damage with the negative control. In the MN tests, the PCE/NCE ratio was evaluated with the Kruskal–Wallis test. In antimutagenicity/antigenotoxicity assays, Mann– Whitney U test was used to compare all groups tested with the Tween 20 (20%) plus CP group, to assess the decrease in DNA damage. To test whether any groups demonstrated signiﬁcant reduction in DNA damage to basal levels, those groups were also compared with negative control by the Mann–Whitney U test. Results Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The 1H NMR spectrum from extract showed signals with absorptions in d 1.98–2.09, 2.20–2.40, 3.43, 5.07–5.45, 6.25– 6.75, similar to those described for casearins and other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C.sylvestris (10,16–18). Both casearin U and caseargrewiin F were identiﬁed in the extract. However, casearin U was not assayed in the present study. Quantitative High performance liquid chromatography- diode array detector analysis demonstrated that the content of caseargrewiin F in the extract was 40.0 mg/g. Additionally, the chromatogram (Figure 2) presented 29 peaks with UV spectrum similar to observed for casearins and caseargrewiin F (kmax 5 231–236 nm). The results of chemical analysis suggest the presence of these clerodane diterpenes in the extract. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) for ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table I. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were observed at 50 and 75 mg/kg (both P , 0.01). The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that there was no cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris Table II shows the protective effect of the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. Since Tween 20 (20%) was used to dissolve the ethanolic extract, in the vehicle control this solution was administered before the CP to ensure that it has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect of the test group. Consequently, there is no difference between Tween 20 (20%) plus CP and positive control. When the protective effect was evaluated by the MN test, an antimuta- genic effect was observed in mice treated with 6.25 (P , 0.01) and 12.5 mg/kg (P , 0.05). However, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not reduce the DNA damage to the basal level. In the comet assay, the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 3.13 (P , 0.01), 6.25 (P , 0.01), 12.5 (P , 0.05) and 25 mg/kg (P , 0.05). Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—caseargrewiin F The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table III. Clastogenicity and primary damage were observed at 3.8 mg/kg b.w. of caseargrewiin F (both P , 0.05) Fig. 2. Results from HPLC-DAD analysis. (A) Chromatogram of extract from the leaves of Casearia sylvestris; asterisk (*) indicates peaks with UV spectrum similar to casearins and caseargrewiina F. (B) Caseargrewiin F UV spectrum. Casearia sylvestris protects DNA damage 503 in, respectively, the MN test and comet assay. The parameter used to assess genotoxicity by comet assay was % DNA in tail. The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that caseargrewiin F was not cytotoxic to mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of caseargrewiin F The antimutagenesis/antigenotoxicity assays were performed to determine if caseargrewiin F protects DNA from inducible damage (CP, 50 mg/kg b.w.). Table IV shows the protective effect of caseargrewiin F against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. In the positive control, water was administered before CP, in order to maintain the same conditions as in the test groups (gavage intake) while determining the DNA damage induced by the CP without protection. To verify that Tween 80 has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect in the test group, we administered the emulsifying solution before the CP. The negative control was used to check basal levels of DNA damage. The caseargrewiin F did not show a statistically signiﬁcant protective effect when assessed by the MN test. However, in the comet assay, it signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 0.63 (P , 0.01), 1.3 (P , 0.01) and 2.5 (P , 0.01) mg/kg b.w. Discussion Previously, natural products have been used in popular medicine to treat several diseases without any knowledge about how harmful these compounds may be to human health. Recently, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of these natural products (19–21). In the present study, distinct assays were performed to reveal whether the ethanolic extracts of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F were mutagenic and or genotoxic. The results presented here demonstrated that the extract was genotoxic and mutagenic at highest concentrations in comet assay and MN test (50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F was both mutagenic and Table I.

M. de Oliveira et al. 504 genotoxic at the highest dose of 3.8 mg/kg b.w. A similar result was obtained in a recent study that describes mutagenic and genotoxic activity at high concentrations of another clerodane diterpene assessed by the MN test and comet assay (22). Considering that comet assay detects genomic lesions that are susceptible to DNA repair while MN test reveals more drastically lesions in chromosome level (23), it is important to realize that the two highest concentrations of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and at the high concentration case- argreiin F induced unrepairable DNA damage. A mutagenic effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F could represent a potential antitumour property, as previous works on C.sylvestris demonstrated strong antitumour activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (17) and its casearins (clerodane diterpenes) exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against V-79 tumour cells (18). Interestingly, in the comet assay, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was more efﬁcient at preventing primary DNA damage at low concentrations (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). The molecules with non-mutagenic and/or antimutagenic properties could have antioxidant properties and, sometimes, may activate DNA repair pathways (24). They may act directly on the mutagenic process, by increasing the ﬁdelity in DNA replication (desmutagens) or by stimulating DNA damage error-free repair (bio-antimutagenesis) (25). Additionally, ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not presented a dose- dependent response in both comet assay and MN test, and this result can be affected by various associated factors such as dependence of the effect of the substance on dose, the complexity of the test organism and the inﬂuence of simultaneous metabolic routes and enzymatic pathways (26). Caseargrewiin F was not antimutagenic when assessed by the MN test, but showed an antigenotoxic dose-dependent re- sponse in the comet assay over the range of 0.63–2.5 mg/kg b.w. (Table IV). In accordance with the present work, previous study has demonstrated that essential oil of C.sylvestris has clastogenicity and anticlastogenicity in HTC cell line (27). Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were identiﬁed in the essential oil (28) whereas in the present study, sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes were identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract. Among 15 sesquiter- penes identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract, 13 were previous identiﬁed in essential oil (11,28). The mutagenic and genotoxic activity as well as the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris could be related to the sesquiterpenes. Additionally, there are recent studies that describe sesquiter- penes as chemopreventive (27,29). However, we cannot exclude the potential biological effects of the clerodane diterpenes since caseargrewiin F protected DNA from primary damage. Moreover, the use of mice instead of cell lines to assess protective effect of ethanolic extract could better verify absorption and metabolism of C.sylvestris in a complex organism. Recently, natural products have been described to protect DNA from damage and cause DNA damage (30,31) as observed in the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and case- argrewiin F. Similar results were obtained in earlier studies and described these products as Janus compounds, referring to the mytological Roman god Janus, who had two faces in the same: one looking forward and the other backward (32). Comet assay also revealed that C.sylvestris exhibited chemoprotective effects, but was not able to reduce the levels of DNA damage to negative controls values. Other studies suggested similar effects. Santos and Takahashi (33) demonstrated that seleno- methionine, a selenium-derived antioxidant compound, was both genotoxic and antigenotoxic and reduced the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, but not to values as low as the negative control. Cytotoxic events could lead to overestimation of the chemoprotective effects observed here. Thus, it is also important to consider that C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F did not exhibit cytotoxic effects alone neither in combination with the CP as observed in the PCE/NCE values. Likewise, the chemoprotective effects can be considered only in the concentrations that did not exhibit genotoxic effects, a recom- mendation of the publication of Zeiger (34). Thus, our results demonstrate that the beneﬁts of using ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F as DNA protective compounds could be respectively safe at doses ,50 mg/kg b.w. and 3.8 mg/kg b.w. We conclude that the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protects DNA against damage in low concentrations, which was carefully estimated by using MN test and comet assay. Keeping in mind that the same ethanolic extract and caseargrewiin F also can cause DNA damage in high concentrations.

Received July 2, 2007; accepted January 24, 2008; published online January 28, 2008 In early studies, we have reported the antinociceptive proﬁle of ()-spectaline, a piperidine alkaloid from Cassia spectabilis. The present study describes the synthesis, the antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities of a series of 2,3,6-trialkyl-piperidine alkaloids: the natural ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) and ten semi-synthetic spectaline derivatives. Structure–activity relationship (SARs) studies were performed. The struc- tures of all synthesized derivatives were conﬁrmed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance. Compounds were evaluated for their analgesic (acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constrictions, hot-plate test, formalin-in- duced pain test) and some of them for the anti-inﬂammatory activities (carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test). The pharmacological results showed that several of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than ()-spectaline. LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. In the formalin-induced pain only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the in- ﬂammatory phase, ()-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity. In the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, only ()-spectaline exhibited an anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg. Our results suggest different mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio-776 (3-O-Boc- spectaline), LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl-spectaline) and ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754).

Design Concept of the New 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Derivatives writhing test (ED5048.5 mmol/kg) and capsaicin induced pain (ED5020.8 mmol/kg).8) Extending our research program concerning the bio- prospection of natural products and its derivatives, we have selected, to conclude this investigation, another abundant piperidine alkaloid, ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio- 755, Chart 1) and synthesized other 10 semi-synthetic deriva- tives prepared from natural ()-spectaline, i.e. a series of 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloids. The present study was focused on the synthesis, evaluation of antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory properties and structure–activity rela- tionship (SAR) analysis of these new derivatives in order to verify the stereoelectronic contributions and requirements of the pharmacophoric groups A, B and C for the antinocicep- tive and anti-inﬂammatory activities (Chart 1). Results and Discussion The antinociceptive proﬁle of all new 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine derivatives developed herein was initially evalu- ated using classical acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constriction test,9) with indomethacin as standard. The results are disclosed in Fig. 1. Some of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than ()-spectaline and indomethacin. Among them, the natural acetate derivative (LASSBio-755) and its O-Boc analogue (LASSBio-776) were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. Based on these results some preliminary structure–activity relationships were analysed. Comparing the inhibitory proﬁle of compounds LASSBio- 782, LASSBio-821 and LASSBio-775 with LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755 indicates that the presence of groups that blocked the hydrogen bond donnor character of the piperi- dine nitrogen seems to be deletery for the analgesic activity. On the other hand, the antinociceptive activity showed to be inversely dependent of the volume of the groups at C-3 (OR1 group) once that the inhibition of the constrictions follows the order R1HAcBoc. The introduction of more polar and hydrogen bond-donating hydroxy groups at C-13 in the alcohol or oxime derivatives, i.e. LASSBio-781, LASSBio- 820 and LASSBio-784, did not result in a increase of the an- tinociceptive activity but indicated through the direct com- parison of the bioproﬁle of compounds LASSBio-781 and LASSBio-820 that the stereochemistry at C-3 seems to be a pharmacophoric requirement for an adequate ﬁt in the target receptor. Additionally, the introduction of an acetyl group at C-3 of LASSBio-755 modify drastically the toxicological as- pect of these alkaloids, once that it did not show any sign of toxicity when administered at a single dose of 500 mmol/kg (data not shown) in contrast with ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754).8) Considering the signiﬁcant antinociceptive activity ob- served for LASSBio-755 and its analogue LASSBio-776 we decided to investigate its effects on other models of pain and compare the results with that showed by ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754).8) In the formalin-induced pain10) only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the inﬂammatory phase, ()-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity (Fig. 2). Indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the later phase without interfering on the earlier one in the formalin-induced pain test.11) These results on the for- malin test led us to investigate the anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle of these same compounds on the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema.9) LASSBio-755 and, unexpectedly, LASSBio- 776 did not show an anti-inﬂammatory activity at the dose used. Only ()-spectaline was able to inhibit the edema for- mation, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg (Fig. 3). The same order of potency was observed for both antinociceptive (ED5048.5 mmol/kg)8) and anti-inﬂammatory (ED5056.6 mmol/kg) (Fig. 3) activities of ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754), indicating a common pathway of action. Despite the absence of effect on the neurogenic phase of the formalin test at the dose used, LASSBio-755 and LASS- Bio-776 showed a signiﬁcant increase in the latency time in the hot-plate test,12) similar to morphine, while ()-spec- taline (LASSBio-754), even at a dose of 300 mmol/kg, was inactive (Fig. 4). The hot-plate and formalin test differs in some aspects. Hot-plate test is based on the use of a short-duration nocicep- tive thermal stimulus (phasic pain) while formalin use a long-duration chemical stimulus (tonic pain). Tissue injury leads to a persistent afferent input in the latter. The nocicep- tive response in the ﬁrst phase of formalin and hot-plate models seems to result from direct activation of nociceptors and is inhibited by drugs which act mainly at central sites.13,14) Centrally acting analgesics are also effective in the second phase.10) This phase is attributed mainly to the devel- opment of an inﬂammatory reaction at the site of injection and increased synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.13) 408 Vol. 56, No. 4 Fig. 1.

Considering the central activity observed for LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 in the hot-plate test, it was expected to observe some activity in the earlier phase of the formalin that could be dependent of the magnitude of the dose. The ﬁrst phase of formalin is brief and occurs in the ﬁrst 5 min. The ﬁrst measure in the hot-plate test was at 30 min and only LASSBio-755 showed a signiﬁcant activity. LASSBio-776 showed a signiﬁcant activity from 60 min. Since the com- pounds were administered orally and the dose used was the same in both tests, the lack of activity on the neurogenic phase could be related with the pharmacokinetics proﬁle of the compounds and somewhat with the mechanisms of the pain processing in these different models. Recently, searching for new candidates compounds useful for treating Alzheimer’s disease, the chloride analogues of some of these semi-synthetic piperidine alkaloid derivatives were described as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.15) The cholinergic system was involved in the transmission of noci- ceptive information and cholinergic drugs, such as mus- carinic and nicotinic agonists, and also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were described to induce antinociception.16—18) The acetylcholine-induced constriction test has been used for screening analgesic compounds.19) In this model ()-spec- taline and LASSBio-776 similarly inhibited the constrictions by 44.7% and 47.9%, respectively, while LASSBio-755 showed a more important antinociceptive effect, inhibiting the constrictions by 82% (Fig. 5). These results in addition with the hot-plate test and the acetylcholinesterase in- hibition15) suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the antinociceptive response elicited by LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755. Taken together these results suggest differents mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio- 776 (3-O-Boc-spectaline) and LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl- spectaline), acting mainly by modulation of receptors located at central nervous system, and for ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754) that showed to be a peripheral analgesic and anti-in- ﬂammatory agent. In conclusion, this study revealed new analgesic com- pounds derived from ()-spectaline without apparent toxic- ity and gave support to the strategy of modiﬁcations of iso- lated natural products from brazilian biodiversity seeking the optimization of the biological activities in the search of new drug candidates. Experimental Chemistry The natural alkaloids ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754) and ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) were obtained from the ethanolic extract of ﬂowers of Cassia spectabilis (DC.) IRWIN et BARN (Leguminosae), as previously described. 6,7) For the preparation of the target derivatives from ()-spectaline (LASS- Bio-754) the reaction sequences outlined in Chart 2 were followed. Reaction of LASSBio-754 with HCl under anhydrous conditions in CH2Cl2 yielded the hidrochloride LASSBio-768. Carbamate LASSBio-775 and carbonate LASSBio-776 were prepared, as a 1 : 2 mixture, by reaction of LASSBio- 754 with (BOC)2O/Et3N in CH2Cl2.20—22) Silyl ether LASSBio-777 was obtained by reaction of LASSBio-754 with tert-butyl dimethyl silyl triﬂate (TBSOTf)/2,6-lutidine in CH2Cl2.23,24) Treatment of carbonate LASSBio- 776 with BzCl/4-DMAP/Et3N25,26) and MsCl/Et3N in CH2Cl2 afforded N- benzoyl carbonate LASSBio-782 and N-methanesulfonyl carbonate LASS- Bio-821, respectively. Oxidation of LASSBio-754 under Jones conditions yielded the diketone LASSBio-766, that was subsequently reduced with LiAlH4 in THF to afford LASSBio-820. Reduction of LASSBio-754 with NaBH4 in MeOH furnished LASSBio-781, that differs from LASSBio-820 at the absolute conﬁguration on C-3. Finally, LASSBio-754 was converted into the oxime LASSBio-784 by reaction with NH2OH·HCl in pyridine/ EtOH.27,28) Melting points were determined with a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melt- ing point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were April 2008 409 Fig. 3.

Pharmacology Experiments were carried out in albino swiss mice (20—25 g) and rats (150—200 g) of both sexes from LASSBio (Faculty of Pharmacy, UFRJ, Brazil) breeding unit. All animals were kept in standard- ized conditions, maintained only with water ad libitum for 12 h before the experiment. Animal experiments were performed according to the “Princi- ples of Laboratory Animal Care and Use in Research” (Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal-COBEA/Instituto Brasileiro Carlos Chagas Filho-IBCCFO, Brazil), based on international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and ethical guidelines for investigation of experi- mental pain in conscious animals.29) All compounds were administered orally (0.1 ml/20 g) as a suspension in arabic gum (0.5% in saline) (vehicle) 1 h before the noxius stimulus. In- domethacin was used as standard. Results are expressed as meanS.E.M. of “n” animals per group and the activities expressed as percentage of inhibi- tion when compared with the vehicle control group. The data were statisti- cally analyzed by the Student’s t test for a signiﬁcance level of ∗p0.05. When appropriated, the ED50 values (i.e. the dose able to elicit 50% of the maximum effect observed) were determined by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software. Acetic Acid-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice The antinoci- ceptive activity was determined in vivo using the mouse abdominal constric- tion test induced by acetic acid 0.6% (0.1 ml/10 g; i.p.).9) Compounds and in- domethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Ten minutes after i.p. injection of the acetic acid the number of constrictions per animal was recorded for 20 min. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Acetylcholine-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice Constric- tions were induced by acetylcholine (4.0 mg/kg; i.p.) and the number of con- strictions per animal was recorded for 10 min.30) ()-Spectaline, LASSBio- 755 and LASSBio-776 were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Formalin-Induced Pain in Mice The formalin-induced pain test was carried out as described by Hunskaar and Hole.10) Animals were injected subplantarly with 20 ml of 2.5% formalin in hind paw. ()-Spectaline, LASSBio-755, LASSBio-776, indomethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. The time that mice spent licking or biting the injected paw or leg was recorded. Two distinct periods of intensive licking activity were identiﬁed and scored separately unless otherwise stated. The ﬁrst period (earlier or neurogenic phase) was recorded 0—5 min after formalin injection and the second period (later or inﬂammatory phase) was recorded 15— 30 min after injection. Anti-inﬂammatory Activity The anti-inﬂammatory activity was deter- mined in vivo using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test as previ- ously described.9) ()-Spectaline and indomethacin were administered at a range dose of 10—300 mmol/kg and 0.3—100 mmol/kg respectively, LASS- Bio-755 and LASSBio-776 at 100 mmol/kg. Animals were then injected subplantarly with either 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenan solution in saline (0.1 mg/paw) or sterile saline (NaCl 0.9%) into one of the hind paw, respec- tively. The paw volumes were measured using a glass plethysmometer cou- pled to a peristaltic pump, 3 h after the subplantar injection. The edema was calculated as the volume difference between the carrageenan and saline- treated paw. Hot-Plate Test Central analgesic activity was investigated using the hot plate test as described earlier.12) In these experiments, the hot plate apparatus (Ugo Basile, Model-DS 37) was maintained at 561 °C. Mice were placed on the heated surface and the time between placement and the ﬁrst sign of paw licking or jumping was recorded as latency. Latency was recorded at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral administration of vehicle, morphine (39.5 mmol/kg, used as positive control) or compounds (100 mmol/kg). The basal latencies were found to be 6—10 s. A cut-off time of 30 s was followed to prevent any injury to the paws.

In this context, some enzymes such as cyclooxygenases, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) have been widely rec- ognized as powerful targets for the action of anti-inﬂamma- tory agents.1—3) MPO is a leukocyte-derived heme peroxi- dase which has long been considered as a microbial enzyme centrally linked to the unspeciﬁc immune defense system. MPO plays an important role in oxidants production by poly- morphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). It uses hydrogen perox- ide (H2O2) and chloride gas to catalyze the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which contributes to both micro- bial killing, and subsequent oxidative injury of host tissue triggering severe inﬂammatory disorders,4) including rheuma- toid arthritis,5) inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD),6) cystic ﬁbrosis,7) neonatal lung injury,8) and adult respiratory distress syndrome.9) Thus, the search for new MPO inhibitors from natural sources can provide prototypes for the anti-inﬂamma- tory drug discovery, and design of novel therapeutic strate- gies. Pterogyne nitens TULASNE (Fabaceae) popularly known as “cocal”, “yvira-ró”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” is a highly branched and ca. 5—12 m high tree.10) Its wood is used for house building, for furniture and to make bows.11) In folk medicine, stem barks have been used as antiparasitic agent e.g., for treatment of ascariasis.12) As previously reported, the leaves of P. nitens yielded ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which ex- hibited cytotoxic activity against the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against to CHO Aux B1 cells.13) Preliminary study on additional bio- logical activities of P. nitens indicated a strong inhibition of rat paw edema suggesting the presence of anti-inﬂammatory compounds in its leaves EtOH extract which prompted us to investigate its chemical composition and evaluate the antioxi- dant and MPO inhibitory properties of the isolates. Experimental Plant Material Leaves of Pterogyne nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher speci- men (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Insti- tute (SP, Brazil). Isolation and Puriﬁcation The shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (1.8 l3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with ethanol (2.7 l3) at room temper- ature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-butanol. After solvent removal using a rotaevaporator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1—E11). Chromatographic puriﬁcation of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (46 : 53.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 10 ml/min] led to the isolation of compounds 1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (55 : 44.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 13 ml/min], afford- ing compound 3 (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identiﬁcation as compound 5 (130 mg). The butanol frac- tion (1.8 g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1—B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4—B6 were combined (333 mg) and pu- riﬁed by RP-HPLC (MeOH : H2O : AcOH (68 : 31.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm and ﬂow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds 2 (66 mg) and 4 (89 mg). Radical Scavenging Activity (RSA) Antioxidant activity of com- pounds 1—6 was determined using DPPH· (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS· [2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as- reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1—6 and positive controls at various con- centrations (33.3—1.7 mM) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 mM DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS· was pre- pared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mM) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1 : 0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12—16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS· stock solution was diluted with KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1 : 10 before use) buffer solution (ratio 1 : 88). ABTS· solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds 1—6 and positive controls (0.5—7.0 mg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical May 2008 723 Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory and Radical Scavenging Activities of Flavones from Pterogyne nitens Daniara Cristina FERNANDES,a Luis Octávio REGASINI,a José Carlos Rebuglio VELLOSA,b Patrícia Mendonça PAULETTI,a Ian CASTRO-GAMBOA,a Vanderlan Silva BOLZANI,a Olga Maria Mascarenhas OLIVEIRA,b and Dulce Helena Siqueira SILVA*,a a NuBBE-Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Department of Organic Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil: and b Department of Biochemistry and Chemical Technology, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil. Received December 22, 2007; accepted February 12, 2008; published online February 18, 2008 Two new ﬂavone glucosides, nitensosides A and B (1, 2), together with four known compounds, sorbifolin (3), sorbifolin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (4), pedalitin (5), and pedalitin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (6) were isolated from Pterogyne nitens. Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolu- tion mass spectrometry. All the isolated ﬂavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory ac- tivity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nM on MPO. Additionally, the radical- scavenging capacity of ﬂavones 1—6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox®.

Anti-radical abilities against ABTS· and DPPH· species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition[1(Asample/A)100], where A is test absorbance without sam- ple (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with com- pounds 1—6 or positive controls. Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity Inhibitory effects of 7-me- thoxyﬂavones 1—6 on MPO were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample con- centrations of compounds 1—6 (0.50—50 nM) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibi- tion expressed in concentration-response curves. Results and Discussion Nitensoside A (1) was obtained as yellow amorphous pow- der. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (a,b-unsaturated CO), 1606, 1502, 1452 (CC, aro- matic), and a broad band at 1160 cm1, indicating the pres- ence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These re- sults strongly suggested that compound 1 is a ﬂavonoid gly- coside.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two anomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at d 4.92 (1H, d, J7.0 Hz, H-1), d 4.45 (1H, d, J1.5 Hz, H-1), d 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a), d 3.70 (1H, dd, J10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b), and d 1.04 (1H, d, J6.0 Hz, H-6) suggested the presence of one b-glucopyranosyl and one a-rhamnopyranosyl unit in compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at d 102.4 (C-1), d 100.6 (C-1), d 66.6 (C-6) and d 17.7 (C-6). In the aromatic moiety of compound 1, signals at d 7.96 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-2, 6), 6.94 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-3, 5), 6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4-trihydroxy- ﬂavone).17,19) The singlet at d 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the ﬂavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR res- onance at d 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton signal at d 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.90, which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at d 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations conﬁrmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4-trihydroxy-7-methoxyﬂavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolinH] ion at m/z 301 observed in ﬁrst-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound 1.

Assignment of the inner sugar res- onances was achieved by using the anomeric proton reso- nance at d 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of 1H–1H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (J7.0 Hz) conﬁrmed the b-linkage of the ﬁrst glucosyl moiety. The downﬁeld shift of C-6 (5.5 ppm) and upﬁeld shift of C-5 (1.4 ppm) glucopyra- nosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin- 6-O-b-glucopyranoside,19) indicated that the rhamnopyra- nosyl moiety was attached at C-6. Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at d 100.6 (C-1) and d 3.70 (H-6) conﬁrmed the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage of compound 1. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound 1 showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [MH] at 607.1657 m/z, in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C28H31O15 (607.1657). Compound 2 was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 623.1600 (Calcd 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C28H31O16. The UV and IR spectra of 2 were similar to those of compound 1 suggesting a 6-O- glucosylﬂavone derivative. The IR of 2 showed a broad hy- droxyl band at 3427 cm1, and an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm1, in addition to a C–O stretching band at 1045 cm1, indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of 2 exhibited absorption maxima typical of a ﬂavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The 1H- and 13C-NMR data (Table 1) suggested that compound 2 had the same 7- methoxyﬂavone skeleton as compound 1, except for the pres- ence of a hydroxy group at C-3. In fact, the major difference between compounds 1 and 2 was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at d 7.42 (1H, dd, J8.5, 2.0 Hz, H-6), d 7.50 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz, H-2), and d 6.88 (1H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-5) for compound 2. The 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 2 presented 28 signals, deduced from distor- tionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90°, DEPT 135° and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, ﬁfteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quater- nary carbons, including one a,b-unsaturated ketone at d 182.1, which conﬁrmed the ﬂavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC cor- relation of signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.88 (OMe) in addition to NOESY interaction of signals at d 3.88 and d 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at d 128.0 (C-6) and d 4.89 (H-1), and between signals at d 66.5 (C-6) and d 4.43 (H-1) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage in compound 2. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures of ﬂavones 1 and 2 were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-O-a- rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyﬂavones were isolated and identiﬁed as sorbifolin (3),20) sorbifolin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (4),20) pedalitin (5),20) and pedalitin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (6).13) The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay.14,15) Pedalitin deriva- tives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin de- rivatives, probably due to presence of the ortho-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity.21,22) Pedalitin deriva- tives 2, 5 and 6 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC50 (mM) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC50 values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives 1, 3 and 4 (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the cathecol moi- ety on the B-ring of ﬂavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin de- rivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (5) when compared to its glucosides 2 and 6 in both assays, evi- dencing the inﬂuence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and there- fore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference com- pound quercetin (IC50 4.12 mM), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones.23) Similarly, this trend has also been ob- served for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC50 (5.7 mM to- wards ABTS, and 13.5 mM towards DPPH) than its 6-O-glu- cosyl derivatives 1 and 4, thus conﬁrming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi- calar activity of 7-methoxyﬂavones. Although a broad spectrum of the effects on mam- malian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids,24) few studies have been devoted to the MPO in- hibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols.25,26) MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modiﬁcations.16) The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds 2, 5 and 6, displaying a 3,4-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC50 values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1, 3 and 4, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohy- droxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides 1, 2, 4 and 6 showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between May 2008 725 Fig. 2. Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds 1 and 2 MPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inﬂammation derived diseases. Conclusion The association of antiradicalar properties and MPO in- hibitory activity observed for ﬂavones 1—6, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated ﬂavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inﬂammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme in- volved in inﬂammatory processes.

Berg (Myrtaceae) were screened for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypano- soma cruzi and T. brucei, as well as for their enzymatic inhibitory activities on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and trypanothione reductase (TR) enzymes from T. cruzi and adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) enzyme from Leish- mania tarentolae.

Key words: Myrtaceae, Trypanosoma, Leishmania Introduction Siphoneugena densiflora O. Berg commonly known as Uvatinga belongs to the family Myrta- ceae and occurs in grasslands (“campos rupes- tres”), deciduous forests (“cerrado˜es”) and gallery forests in Goia´s, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Sa˜o Paulo States of Brazil. This plant takes part in a genus comprising only nine species; two of them are vulnerable to extinction in Sa˜o Paulo State (Programa Biota FAPESP, 2007) and one species, S. delicata, has been recently described (Sobral and Proenc¸a, 2006). S. densiflora has been biologically and chemically researched by our group (Gallo et al., 2006a, b, c) since neither data about it could be found in the literature nor popu- lar use has been registered. Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae, formely Verbenaceae) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espı´rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro 0939Ð5075/2008/0500Ð0371 $ 06.00 ” 2008 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen · http://www.znaturforsch.com · D and Sa˜o Paulo, and is commonly called “Taruma˜”. Its leaf tea is used in folk medicine to treat kidney infections (Rodrigues, 2001; Gallo et al., 2008). Several of its compounds had already been charac- terized and bioassayed (Leita˜o et al., 1997; Leita˜o and Delle Monache, 1998; Santos et al., 2001; Men- sor et al., 2001), but none was regarded as neither potential trypanocidal nor enzyme inhibitor. Trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a compli- cated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoal agents. Trypanosomatids have no functional tricarbox- ylic acid cycle, and their bloodstream forms are highly dependent on glycolysis to the stage of pyr- uvate as sole energy supply. Trypanosome glycoly- Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM 372 M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants sis occurs in a specific microbody called glyco- some. Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy neces- sary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy- drogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of Trypanosoma cruzi catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphor- ylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bis- phosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD+ and in- organic phosphate. The in silico modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker et al., 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spermi- dine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb et al., 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the N1,N8-(bisglutathionyl)- spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S]2) to di- hydrotrypanothione (T[SH]2). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S]2) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against try- panosomatids (Hamilton et al., 2003). The genus Leishmania owns three enzymes in- volved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephos- phoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and α-d-5- phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into ad- enosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophos- phate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofura- nose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid se- quence when compared to corresponding mam- malian enzymes, which should allow the develop- ment of selective inhibitor compounds. In our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from T. cruzi or APRT enzyme from Leishmania tarentolae, were assessed. Materials and Methods Plant material Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae) and Sipho- neugena densiflora O.

B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 375 ing to an earlier reported procedure (Vieira et al., 2001). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), i.e., the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentra- tions, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC50 = 55.5 μm). L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activity APRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier de- scribed procedures (Thiemann et al., 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectro- photometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propane- diol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 μL APRT so- lution. The reaction started by the addition of en- zyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira et al., 2001). T. cruzi TR inhibitory activity Enzyme activity and assay were performed ac- cording to prior descriptions (Hamilton et al., 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as posi- tive control [IC50 = 2.72 μm (personal communica- tion, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC50 value was deter- mined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Im- perial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC50 values, and the results were fitted into the equation Y = {Range/[1 + (X/IC50)s]} + Background, where Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in μm), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1). T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assay Bloodstream forms of T. brucei, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% se- rum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of T. brucei was evaluated using the Alamar Blue“ assay (Räz et al., 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 μm. T. cruzi cytotoxicity assay The assay was carried out using blood infected with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi “Y” strain col- lected by cardiac puncture in experimentally in- fected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal mu- rine blood to 2 · 106 trypomastigotes/mL. The as- say was performed in triplicate on titration micro- plates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or com- pounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL and 100 μg/ mL. The plates were incubated at 4 ∞C, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC50 = 31 μg/mL or 76 μm) were run in parallel. The re- sults were expressed as percentage of lysis of try- pomastigote forms compared to the DMSO con- trol. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.

VP-HHL (53%) showed characteristic signals of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. VP-DHL (38%), when submitted to column chromatography, yielded a fraction containing a mixture of steroids which was responsible for 93% of Tc lysis at 500 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table). VP-EHL (36%) yielded compound 18 (31%), and VP-MHL (52%) afforded compounds 18 and 23 (16%). VP-DML, after fractionation, afforded com- pounds 16, 17, and a mixture of flavonoids con- taining quercetin 3-O--d-glucopyranoside and quercetin 4-O--d-glucopyranoside, which caused 97% Tc lysis at 500 μg/L. The same mixture inhib- ited the gGAPDH activity by 92% at 100 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table), which may explain the mechanism of action of the mixture on the trypomastigote forms of the para- site. 16 performed a better activity against T. cruzi (33%, Table II) in comparison with compound 14 (27%), indicating that O-methylation of the 3-hydroxy group was important to improve the activity. VP-BHAL showed a good trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi (60%, Table III), however, the compounds isolated from this fraction did not.

The outcomes from triterpenes 4 (Table I), 24, 25 and 26 (Table II) point out a clear correlation between increasing number of hydroxy groups and higher activity, which justifies a meticulous investi- gation on structure-activity relationships in this case. All the substances tested against T. brucei were inactive, perhaps because of the low concentration (100 μm) tested in contrast to the concentration tested on T. cruzi (500 μg/mL, see Tables I and II). gGAPDH inhibition On the whole, 26 extracts and subfractions were tested. Eleven of them, the most polar (SD-metha- nolic and hydroalcoholic extracts), showed out- comes above 70% (Table III), and the majority belonged to S. densiflora (SD). The ascription of such activities to the hydrolysable tannins 11, 12, 13, and ellagic acid (9) may be considered due to the low IC50 values accomplished by these com- pounds (Table I).

Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 381 Among the flavonoids, the simple and highly oxidized flavonol quercetin (1) was the most ac- tive. The flavone luteolin (14), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduc- tion of the methoxy group at position C-3 (15) or C-3 (16), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested en- zymes (for comparison, see activities of com- pounds 17, 18 and 23 in Table II). The O-glycosyl- ated flavonol quercitrin (2) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone 1. Lio et al. (1985) ob- served the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activi- ties also performed by compounds 21 and 22 (Ta- ble II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I and II). An unseparated mix- ture of lupeol, α-amyrin and -amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from S. densiflora (SD-DML), tested at 200 μm, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentra- tion, a mixture of compound 24 and its isomer 2α,3-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound 24 inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II).

Furthermore, quercetin (1) as well as quercitrin (2), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD- EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had ac- tivities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I and II). When analyzing the results dis- played by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hy- droxy groups. Accordingly, compound 29, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to 28 and two in relation to 30, was twice more active than 28 and seven times more than 30 (Table II). TR inhibition All tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (11) and castalagin (12) which performed an IC50 value of 179.3 μm on enzyme inhibition, although this re- sult is not promising in comparison with clomi- pramine, the positive control.

In this context, endo- phytes belonging to the Penicillium genus have been recognized as a rich source of bioactive sec- ondary metabolites (Fill et al., 2007). Recent ex- amples include the anticancer berkelic acid from Penicillium sp., polyketides with HIV-integrase inhibitory activity from P. chrysogenum and the insecticidal paraherquamides H and I from P. clu- niae (Singh, 2003; Stierle et al., 2006). As part of our interest for bioactive metabo- lites from endophytes associated with Brazilian plants (Cafêu et al., 2005; Inácio et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2006; Teles et al., 2006), Alibertia macrophyl- la (Rubiaceae) was selected for our study, due to the fact that this species accumulates a series of bioactive compounds (Bolzani et al., 1991; Silva et al., 2007). Thus, the major aim of the current study was to identify potential bioactive compounds from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endo- phytes associated with A. macrophylla leaves, by using antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibi- tory assays. Material and Methods General 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the solvents as internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer in the ESI mode using MeOH/H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V).

Naturforsch. 64 c, 824 – 830 (2009); received June 29, 2009 In the course of our continuous search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi living in plants from the Brazilian ﬂ ora, leaves of Alibertia macrophylla (Rubiaceae) were submitted to isolation of endophytes, and two species of Penicillium were isolated. The ac- etonitrile fraction obtained in corn from a culture of Penicillium sp.1 afforded orcinol (1). On the other hand, Penicillium sp.1 cultivated in potato-dextrose-broth furnished two differ- ent compounds, cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val) (2) and uracil (3). The chromatographic fractionation of the acetonitrile fraction obtained from Penicillium sp.2 led to three dihydroisocoumarins, 4-hydroxymellein (4), 8-methoxymellein (5) and 5-hydroxymellein (6). Compounds 5 and 6 were obtained from the Penicillium genus for the ﬁ rst time. Additionally, metabolites 1 – 6 were evaluated for their antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. The most active compounds 1 and 4 exhibited detection limits of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 2 showed a detection limit of 10.0 μg, displaying potent AChE inhibitory activity.

Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde/H2SO4 reagent fol- lowed by heating at 120 ºC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 preparative column (250 mm × 21.2 mm). Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 instrument using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230 – 400 mesh (Merck). Plant material Authenticated Alibertia macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) was collected in Estação Ecológica Experimental de Mogi-Guaçu, Fazenda Campin- inha, Mogi-Guaçu, São Paulo, Brazil, in Novem- ber 2003. The botanical identiﬁ cation was made by Ph.D. Maria Cláudia Marx Young (Institute of Botany, São Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher speci- men was deposited at the Herbarium of the Bo- tanic Garden of São Paulo, Brazil (voucher no. SP 370915). Isolation and identiﬁ cation of the endophytes For isolation of the endophytic fungi, adult and healthy leaves of A. macrophylla were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were ﬁ rst washed with water and soap, and then im- mersed in an 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁ nally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. Sterilized leaves were cut into 2 × 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthramicine sulfate (50 mg/mL) with approx. 3 to 4 pieces on each dish (Silva et al., 2006). The endophytic fungi were identiﬁ ed according to the characteristics of morphology of the cul- ture and spores, mechanism of spore production, and molecular taxonomy according to a modi- ﬁ cation of the rapid preparation of DNA from ﬁ lamentous fungi (Raeder and Broda, 1985). The fungi were identiﬁ ed by Ph.D. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Plu- ridisciplinar de Pesquisas Químicas, Biológicas e Agrícolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in our collection with culture numbers 05070032-C and 05-070032-A for Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, respectively. Preparation of the crude extract in corn and potato-dextrose-broth of Penicillium sp.1 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cool, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d. After the incubation period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 × 250 mL); after that the solvent was evaporated, providing the crude MeOH extract (10.6 g). The methanol extract was dissolved in water and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was suspended in acetonitrile and parti- tioned with hexane. Evaporation of the organic phase resulted in the crude acetonitrile extract (804 mg). The fungus was cultivated using potato-dex- trose-broth (PDB) as culture medium (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/L H2O). For the PDB, 20 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) were used, each containing 100 mg of potato extract, 5.0 g dextrose and 250 mL distilled water, which were autoclaved at 125 °C for 15 min. Approx. 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of Penicillium sp.1 were inoc- ulated into each ﬂ ask, and the ﬂ asks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After in- cubation for 28 d at 25 °C on rotatory shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂ asks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁ ltration, and the ﬁ ltrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 × 2.5 L). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase under reduced pressure yielded a brown, solid residue (507 mg). Preparation of the crude extract in corn of Penicillium sp.2 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cooling, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d.

TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol), in order to wash them, and were thoroughly dried just before use. After migration of the sample in a suitable solvent (or direct deposition of sam- ple), the TLC plate was dried for complete re- moval of the solvent. The plate was then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and thoroughly dried again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was laid ﬂ at on plastic plugs in a plastic tank con- taining a little bit of water; by this means, water did not come directly into contact with the plate but the atmosphere was kept humid. The cover was placed on the tank and incubation was per- formed at 37 °C for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After in- cubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the 1-naph- thyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple colouration after 1 – 2 min. Galanthamine was employed as positive control (Marston et al., 2002). Results and Discussion The molecular structures of all isolates (Fig. 1) were conﬁ rmed by the MS and NMR data as shown below. Assignments were based on 2D- NMR experiments including gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC. Compound 1 was isolated as a brown amor- phous powder and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C7H8O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 123). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic signals, δH 5.99 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-6) and δH 6.01 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H, H-2 and H-4) suggesting a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o spectra showed ﬁ ve signals, assigned to one oxygenated aromatic groups at δC 158.1 (C-1 and C-5), two methines attributed to signals at δC 99.7 (C-6) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4) and one methyl group at δC 21.1 (C-7). The position of the methyl substituent at position C-3 was at- tributed on the basis on the gHMBC experiment, which indicates a correlation of δH 2.43 (H-7) with δC 138.9 (C-3) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4). This data suggests that 1 is orcinol (Monde, 1998). Compound 2 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H16N2O2 ([M+H]+ at m/z 197). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed signals at δH 0.86 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-11), δH 1.02 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12), δH 4.12 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-6), and δH 3.92 (brs, 1H, H-9). Also, three mul- tiplets at δH 3.40 (2H, H-3), 1.78 (2H, H-4), and 2.13 (2H, H-5) were observed. Analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum indicated two methyl groups, three methylene carbon atoms and three methine carbon atoms. The signals at δC 170.2 and δC 165.2 were attributed to two amide carbonyl groups at C-7 and C-1, respectively, and 1H NMR signals of an amino acid suggested that 2 belongs to the diketopiperazine class. The gHMBC cross-peaks between the signal for C-1 and the signals for H-3, H-6, H-9, and H-10, as well as the signal for C-7 and the signals for H-5, H-6, and H-9 conﬁ rmed that 2 was biosynthesized by condensation of the amino acids proline and valine. The interpretation of these results combined with comparison with literature data (Furtado et al., 2005) suggest that diketopiperazine 2 is cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val). Compound 3 was isolated as yellow amorphous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecu- lar formula C4H4N2O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 111). The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 appeared to be relatively simple, exhibiting two doublets at δH 5.41 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-5) and δH 7.38 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-6). The 13C NMR spectrum showed only four signals, for two carbonyl groups [δC 151.9 (C-2) and δC 164.4 (C-4)] and two methines [δC 99.9 (C- 5) and δC 142.9 (C-6)]. These data indicate that 3 is uracil (Schindler, 1998; Martin et al., 2007). Fig. 1. Chemical structures of compounds 1 – 6 isolated from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2. Brought to you by | New York University Bobst Library Technical Services Authenticated Download Date | 7/19/15 10:11 AM 828 C. M. Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecu- lar formula C10H10O4 ([M+Na]+ at m/z 217). The 1H NMR spectrum showed doublets for three ar- omatic protons at δH 6.86 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-5), δH 6.96 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-7) and δH 7.45 (dd, J = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, 1H, H-6). Altogether these signals suggest that 4 presented a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The gCOSY cross-peaks of the doublet at δH 1.51 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-9) coupled to a methine hydrogen atom with a signal at δH 4.63 (dq, J = 6.5, 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-3) in turn coupled to a methine hydrogen atom at δH 4.50 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-4), suggesting an α-methylhydroxy unit in the molec- ular structure of 4. The broad singlet at δH 11.0 (1H) indicated the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a hydroxy group (8-OH) and a carbonyl group (C-1). The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o spectra showed the presence of ten signals, assigned to one methyl [δC 16.0 (C-9)], ﬁ ve methine groups [δC 78.1 (C-3), δC 67.2 (C-4), δC 118.5 (C-5), δC 136.7 (C-6), δC 118.2 (C-7)], and three aromatic quaternary carbon atoms [δC 162.1 (C-8), δC 106.8 (C-8a), δC 140.5 (C-4a)], and one signal at δC 169.1 (C-1), which was attributed to a carbonyl group, suggesting that 4 is an dihydro- isocoumarin. This information coupled to data of the literature (Holler et al., 1999) assigne 4 to the structure of 4-hydroxymellein. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C11H12O3 ([M+H]+ at m/z 193). In particular, a high similarity between the NMR spectral data of compounds 5 and 4 was observed. The major difference was identiﬁ ed in the chemi- cal shifts attributed to H-4 of 5, which showed a multiplet at δH 2.80 (2H, H-4). Furthermore, the presence of a singlet at δH 3.88 (3H, H-10) sug- gested a methoxy substituent. A gHMBC correla- tion was observed between the signal at δC 161.2 (C-8) and H-10, which conﬁ rmed the position of the methoxy group at C-8. This information cou- pled to literature data (Kamisuki, 2007) assigne 5 to the structure of 8-methoxymellein. The dihydroisocoumarin 6 was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data in- dicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M–H]– at m/z 193). Considering differences in the NMR spectral data between compounds 5 and 6, the 1H NMR spectrum of 6 exhibited two ortho-coupled hydrogen atoms at δH 6.73 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-7) and δH 6.92 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-6), suggesting a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o data indicated signals at δC 156.5 and δC 143.0, which where attributed to the hydroxy- lated aromatic carbon atoms C-8 and C-5, respec- tively. These data indicate a hydroquinone ring in the molecular structure of 6, which was identiﬁ ed as 5-hydroxymellein (Harwood, 1984). Compounds 1 – 6 were evaluated for their an- tifungal activity against Cladosporium cladospo- rioides and C. sphaerospermum using a direct bioautography assay (Table I). The most active compounds, orcinol (1) and 4-hydroxymellein (4), showed a potent effect towards the yeasts, exhib- iting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, re- spectively. 5 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity to- wards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 μg, re- Table I.

Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes 829 spectively. 5-Hydroxymellein (6) proved to be not potent, since the content at which this compound showed activity was 50 μg. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydro- isocoumarins and free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8. The identiﬁ cation of the compounds 1, 4 and 5, potentially bioactive against the phytopatho- genic fungi, indicates that they act as defence of the host species against possible attacks of patho- gens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for compounds isolated from Penicillium, few stud- ies have been devoted to the acetylcholineste- rase (AChE) inhibitory activity. AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to terminate the impulse-transmitted action through cholinergic synapses (Stryer, 1995; Sigurdsson and Gudbjar- nason, 2007). Although the fundamental reason of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not clear so far, AD is ﬁ rmly associated with impairment in the cholinergic transmission. A number of AChE in- hibitors have been considered as candidates for the symptomatic treatment of AD as the most useful relieving strategy (Barbosa-Filho et al., 2006; Alarcón et al., 2008). The diketopiperazine 2 exhibited the highest AChE inhibitory activity displaying a detection limit of 10.0 μg (Table I). Compounds 1 and 3 showed a detection limit of 60 μg, which was considered as weakly potent. The dihydroisocoumarin 4 displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 30.0 μg. On the other hand, compounds 5 and 6 were not active (detection limits over 100 μg). Similar to the observed antifungal activ- ity, free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8 corrobo- rate to increase the anti-AChE potency presented by dihydroisocoumarins. In conclusion, six metabolites from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endophytes associ- ated with A. macrophylla leaves, exhibited poten- tial bioactivity, including antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results suggest that com- pounds 2 and 4 should be considered further in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for the use in the drug design for Alzheimer’s disease treatment.

Five compounds, 2-hexyl-3-methyl-butanodioic acid (1), cytochalasin D (2), 7-dechlorogriseofulvin (3), cytochalasin B (4) and griseofulvin (5), have been isolated from the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp., and their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data.

INTRODUÇÃO Vários produtos naturais com propriedades terapêuticas foram isolados de espécies de fungos, especialmente agentes quimio- terápicos, como penicilinas e cefalosporinas usadas até hoje como antibióticos; mevinolina, um agente redutor de colesterol; bleomi- cinas, daunorubicinas e análogos, como agentes antitumorais; avermectina B, um anti-helmíntico de largo espectro, entre outros1,2. Recentemente, o aumento de infecções fúngicas causadas por fun- gos oportunistas, como Candida e Aspergillus, e a resistência microbiana a uma série de antibióticos disponível no mercado es- tão motivando, novamente, as companhias farmacêuticas a investi- rem na busca por substâncias antifúngicas de fontes naturais2. Dentre os microrganismos que acumulam substâncias antifúngicas, fungos e leveduras destacam-se pela quantidade de produtos farmacêuticos de uso corrente na medicina com tais pro- priedades. Os fungos filamentosos, onde os endofíticos estão incluídos, constituem um grupo de microrganismos que biossintetizam uma quantidade fantástica de metabólitos secundários, chegando, em casos especiais, a uma produção 73% superior a de outras classes de microrganismos3. Fungos endofíticos são microrganismos que habitam o interior de plantas e constituem-se em uma fonte valiosa de produtos bioativos4. Este nicho de fungos associados a espécies vegetais de Cerrado e da Mata Atlântica permanece praticamente sem qualquer estudo químico e biológico sendo, portanto, uma fonte potencial de substâncias de interesse farmacológico. Dando continuidade às nossas pesquisas de bioprospecção, vári- as espécies vegetais de Cerrado e Mata Atlântica foram selecionadas para isolamento e cultivo de fungos endofíticos. De Palicourea marcgravii St. Hil., uma Rubiaceae de larga ocorrência no Cerrado, e conhecida popularmente como “erva de rato” ou “café bravo”, fo- ram isolados vários fungos endofíticos. Dentre os já identificados, Xylaria sp. foi selecionado para estudo devido a atividade apresenta- da por seu extrato bruto frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium cladosporioides e Cladosporium sphaerospermum, indicando a produção de metabólitos com atividade antifúngica em potencial. Xylaria sp. foi submetido aos procedimentos usuais de cultivo em larga escala para fornecimento dos extratos brutos que após fracionamento bioguiado, levou ao isolamento de 5 substânci- as: ácido 2-hexilideno-3-metilbutanodióico (1), citocalasina D (2), 7-declorogriseofulvina (3), citocalasina B (4) e griseofulvina (5) (Figura 1). PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectrômetro Varian INOVA-500 operando a 500 MHz para o núcleo de 1H e em 125 MHz para o núcleo de 13C; TMS foi utilizado como referência interna. Os espectros de mas- sas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa reso- lução FISONS- Modelo VG Platfform II, no modo Electrospray. As análises cromatográficas por CLAE no modo analítico foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar da Varian acoplado ao detetor ProStar 330 de arranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analítica Phenomenex Fenil-Hexil (250 x 4,60 mm; 5 μm). No modo preparativo, as análises por CLAE foram realizadas em equipa- mento ProStar da Varian acoplado ao detetor ProStar UV, utilizan- do coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexil (250 x 21,20 mm; 10 μm). Nas separações cromatográficas em coluna aberta ou sob pressão fo- ram utilizadas sílica gel C-18 (Merck) e Sephadex LH-20 (Merck) como fases estacionárias. Para cultivo de Xylaria sp. em meio lí- quido foram utilizados 20 frascos de Erlenmeyers (500 mL) con- tendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo preparado a partir de água Mili- Q e PDB (DIFCO), posteriormente submetidos a esterilização em autoclave a 121 oC e 1 atm de pressão por 20 min. Para cultivo em meio sólido de milho foram colocados 90 g de milho descascado (Yoki) em 2 Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 75 mL de água desti- lada. Estes meios foram autoclavados quatro vezes (4 dias) por 40 min à temperatura de 121 oC e 1 atm de pressão. 992 Quim. Nova Cafêu et al. Material vegetal A espécie vegetal Palicourea marcgravii St. Hil. (Rubiaceae) foi coletada, em junho de 2001, na Estação Ecológica Experimen- tal de Mogi-Guaçú (SP). Uma exsicata do material vegetal identi- ficado encontra-se depositada no Herbário do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente de São Paulo (SP). Isolamento da cepa fúngica O fungo endofítico foi isolado de folhas saudáveis de Palicourea marcgravii. As folhas foram lavadas com água e sabão e esteriliza- das por imersão em NaClO 1% (5 min) e em etanol 70% (1 min), seguidas de lavagem com água estéril (10 min) e secagem5. Após o processo de esterilização, as folhas foram cortadas e incubadas em placas de Petri contendo PDA, às quais foi adicionado o antibióti- co sulfato de antamicina (50 mg/mL) para evitar crescimento de bactérias contaminantes. Repiques sucessivos em placas de Petri contendo PDA resultaram no isolamento de 4 linhagens codifica- das como PM-01, PM-02, PM-03 e PM-04. Estas linhagens foram preservadas em frascos esterilizados com água. A linhagem PM- 03, identificada como Xylaria sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning, Departamento de Fitopatologia da Universidade Federal de Lavras – MG, foi selecionada para estudo químico, visando a obtenção das substâncias bioativas. Cultivo do microrganismo e obtenção dos extratos brutos A cepa fúngica de Xylaria sp. foi repicada em placa de Petri contendo PDA e incubada por 7 dias. Após este período, o fungo foi inoculado nos meios de cultivo líquido (PDB) e sólido (Milho). Em PDB, Xylaria sp. foi cultivada em 4000 mL de meio (20 fras- cos de Erlenmeyers de 500 mL) e mantida em incubadora rotatória (“shaker”) sob temperatura controlada (24 oC) por aproximadamente 28 dias, fornecendo o caldo fermentado. O caldo foi submetido à filtração para separação dos micélios e à partição líquido/líquido com AcOEt que, após a evaporação do solvente, forneceu 2,0 g do extrato bruto acetato de etila (PDB-AcOEt). Xylaria sp. também foi cultivada em meio sólido milho, onde permaneceu incubada por 21 dias, à 24 oC em modo estático. Em seguida, foi realizada a extração com metanol, filtração para separação dos micélios e con- centração do solvente, fornecendo 5,3 g de extrato bruto metanólico (milho-MeOH). Isolamento dos constituintes químicos O extrato bruto PDB-AcOEt (2,0 g) foi dissolvido em acetato de etila e, em seguida, particionado com hexano e acetonitrila, resul- tando em duas soluções. A solução ACN, após concentração, forne- ceu a fração ACN (0,7 g) que foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna usando sílica de fase reversa (C-18), eluída com MeOH:H2O no modo gradiente, resultando em sete sub-frações. As sub-frações ACN-4 a ACN-7 foram reunidas (ACN4-7; 400 mg) devido à bioatividade apresentada frente às linhagens Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. Esta sub-fração ACN4-7 foi submetida a uma partição com acetato de etila e solução de hidróxido de sódio 5%. A fase aquosa foi tratada com ácido clorídrico até pH 5 e, em seguida, extraída com clorofórmio que, após a concentração do solvente, forneceu a substância 1 (100 mg). A fase orgânica (AcOEt), após concentração do solvente, foi fracionada em uma co- luna Sephadex LH-20 eluída com metanol, resultando em 10 sub- frações (FCS 1-10). A sub-fração FCS-1 (23 mg) foi submetida à CLAE preparativa empregando modo de eluição isocrático acetonitrila:água (38:62), fluxo 20 mL/min, λ 221 nm e coluna fenil hexil, resultando no isolamento da substância 2 (3,5 mg). O extrato bruto milho-MeOH (5,3 g) foi analisado por RMN de 1H, onde constataram-se vários sinais referentes a hidrogênios metínicos e metílicos típicos de açúcares. Para remover estes açú- cares, uma porção do extrato (1 g) foi dissolvida (parcialmente) em acetato de etila, obtendo-se a fração AcOEt-milho (210 mg). Em seguida, esta fração foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna com sílica de fase reversa C-18 no modo de eluição isocrático empregando MeOH:H2O (80:20), resultando em M-1 (100 mg). A subfração M-1 foi purificada por CLAE preparativa utilizando como eluente MeOH:H2O (60:40), fluxo de 15 mL/min, coluna fenil hexil e λ 221 nm fornecendo 8 sub-frações (M1.1 – M1.8). As sub-fra- ções M1.3, M1.5 e M1.7 resultaram no isolamento das substâncias 3 (8,3 mg), 4 (20,6 mg) e 5 (8,8 mg). Figura 1. Substâncias produzidas por Xylaria sp. 993 Substâncias Antifúngicas de Xylaria sp. Vol. 28, No. 6 Bioensaio Os extratos brutos (PDB-AcOEt e milho-MeOH) e as substân- cias isoladas foram submetidos à técnica de Bioautografia para detecção de atividade antifúngica. Este bioensaio consiste na nebulização de suspensões dos fungos Cladosporium cladosporioides e Cladosporium sphaerospermum (concentração 5 x 107 esporos/mL em solução de glicose e sais) em placas de CCDC contendo 400 μg dos extratos brutos e 100 μg das substân- cias puras, previamente eluídas com solvente adequado. Em segui- da, as placas foram incubadas em câmara úmida a 25 oC por 48 h. O aparecimento de zonas de inibição na placa nebulizada com C. sphaerospermum e/ou C. cladosporioides indica a presença de substância(s) com potencial antifúngico6. A nistatina foi a substân- cia utilizada como antifúngico padrão. As substâncias puras que se mostraram potencialmente bioativas foram submetidas a bioensaio, para determinação do limite de detecção. Os resultados são expressos como valores de concentra- ção da amostra (μg/mL) requeridos para produzir um halo de inibi- ção comparável com o produzido pelo padrão nistatina. Os ensaios foram realizados em diferentes concentrações (100, 50, 25, 10, 5 e 1 μg/mL) para as substâncias puras e para o padrão. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos brutos PDB-AcOEt e milho- MeOH, produzidos pelo fungo endofítico Xylaria sp., resultou no isolamento do ácido 2-hexilideno-3-metilbutanodióico (1), citocalasina D (2), 7-declorogriseofulvina (3), citocalasina B (4) e griseofulvina (5). A identificação destas substâncias foi realizada com base na comparação de seus dados espectroscópicos (RMN 1H e 13C, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC e EM) com valores disponí- veis na literatura. Os metabólitos 1-5 já haviam sido produzidos por fungos da família Xylariaceae, entretanto, este é o primeiro relato da produção de 3, 4 e 5 por um fungo endofítico. A análise detalhada dos espectros de massas, RMN de 1H e 13C (uni e bidimensionais), além da comparação com dados da litera- tura7, permitiu a identificação de 1 como ácido 2-hexilideno-3- metilbutanodióico. A substância 2 foi identificada como citocalasina D (C30H37NO6) através da análise dos dados de RMN de 1H e 13C e EM-ES (+120 V) e evidenciou 13 graus de insaturação. A análise dos dados de RMN de 1H e 13C indicou a presença de três carbonilas, um anel benzênico monossubstituído e seis carbonos olefínicos, o que re- sultou no grau de insaturação 10. Os 3 graus de insaturações rema- nescentes sugeriram que a molécula fosse constituída por 3 anéis, além do anel aromático. O espectro de hidrogênio apresentou si- nais em δH 3,57 e 5,26 característicos de hidrogênios carbinólicos, que foram atribuídos à H-7 e H-21. A geometria das ligações du- plas Δ13-14 e Δ19-20 foi determinada como E, devido às constantes de acoplamento (J = 15,0 Hz) entre os hidrogênios. Os sinais δH 1,38, 1,05, 0,39 e 2,27 foram atribuídos às metilas H3C-23, H3C-22, H3C- 11 e H3C-25, respectivamente. O sinal referente a uma metila em δH 2,27 é típico de citocalasina com um grupo acetato na forma de radical. Estas informações aliadas à análise dos dados espectrométricos de RMN de 1H, 13C, gHMQC, gHMBC, gCOSY, EM e comparação com os dados da literatura8 confirmaram a subs- tância 2 como sendo uma citocalasina do tipo D. A configuração relativa de 2 foi determinada por comparação dos valores de deslo- camentos químicos de RMN 1H e 13C, constantes de acoplamentos e comparação com os dados da literatura. Experimento de rotação ótica forneceu [α]D 25 +15,4 (c. 0,25 EtOH), condizente com a lite- ratura9, permitindo identificá-la como (+)-citocalasina D. Os valo- res dos deslocamentos químicos da citocalasina D (2) estão apre- sentados na Tabela 1. A substância 4 foi identificada como citocalasina B através da análise dos dados espectrométricos de RMN de 1H e 13C (uni e bidimensionais), EM-ES (+120 V) e comparação com dados da literatura10,11. Os sinais registrados pelo espectro de RMN de 1H em δH 5,81, 5,03, 6,76 e 5,70 foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios das ligações duplas Δ13-14 e Δ21-22, respectivamente. Ambas ligações du- plas possuem geometria E, uma vez que a constante de acoplamento entre os hidrogênios H-13-H-14 e H-21-H-22 é de 15,5 Hz. Pelo espectro de RMN de 1H também foi possível verificar a presença de 2 metilas (CH3-11 e CH3-24) e de hidrogênios carbinólicos (δH 3,61 e 4,36) atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-7 e H-20. Os dados espectrométricos de 4 foram comparados com os da citocalasina D (2), onde foi possível notar uma grande semelhança nos sinais e constatou-se que 4 se tratava de uma substância da classe de citocalasinas. A diferença marcante entre 2 e 4 está na ausência de um sinal entre δH 2,10-2,30, atribuído ao deslocamento químico da metila do acetato, o que permitiu propor que a ligação com o C-9 ocorre com o oxigênio do grupo acetato, em vez de se ligar no átomo de carbono como no caso da citocalasina D (2). A configu- ração relativa de 4 foi determinada por comparação dos valores de Tabela 1.

Nova Cafêu et al. Os extratos brutos (PDB e milho) e as substâncias isoladas fo- ram submetidas a um ensaio preliminar para avaliação da ativida- de antifúngica através da técnica de Bioautografia. O extrato bruto obtido em milho, assim como as substâncias isoladas deste extrato (3, 4 e 5) não se mostraram ativas frente às linhagens Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. Entretanto a griseofulvina (5) é atualmente utilizada como um poderoso antimicótico, sendo comercializada em medicamentos como Fulcinâ (Zeneca) e Sporostatinâ (Shering Plough) com atividade contra várias espéci- es de Microsporum, Epidermophyton e Trychophyton. O extrato bruto obtido após cultivo de Xylaria sp. em PDB e os compostos ácido 2-hexilideno-3-metilbutanodióico (1) e citocalasina D (2) mostraram-se ativos frente às linhagens C. cladosporioides e C. spahaerospermum. Os resultados dos limites de detecção das subs- tâncias 1 e 2 estão apresentados na Tabela 3, e este é o primeiro relato do potencial antifúngico demonstrado por estas substâncias. CONCLUSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos produzidos por Xylaria sp. per- mitiu o isolamento de substâncias com atividade antifúngica em potencial e de interesse comercial, evidenciando os fungos endofíticos como promissores na busca por metabólitos bioativos. Este é o primeiro relato das substâncias 3, 4 e 5 serem produzidas por um fungo endofítico do gênero Xylaria. As substâncias 1 e 2 já foram relatadas como metabólitos de Xylaria sp., porém esta é deslocamentos químicos em RMN de 1H, 13C, constantes de acoplamentos e comparação com dados da literatura8. O experi- mento de rotação ótica forneceu [α]D 25 +71,3 (c. 0,006 MeOH) e permitiu identificar 4 como (+)-citocalasina B. Os valores dos des- locamentos químicos da citocalasina B (4) estão apresentados na Tabela 1. A substância 3 foi identificada como 7-decloro-griseofulvina (C17H18O6) através da análise dos dados espectrométricos e com- paração com a literatura12. O espectro de massas obtido pela téc- nica EM-ES (+35 V) apresentou o pico base (100%) em m/z 319 [M + H]+ e picos em m/z 341 [M + Na]+ e m/z 181 [M + C8H10O2]+, indicando 9 graus de insaturação, permitindo propor um sistema de três ciclos e seis insaturações. O espectro de RMN de 1H re- gistrou sinais em δH 6,15 (d, J=1,5 Hz) e δH 5,97 (d, J=1,5 Hz) sugerindo um padrão de substituição meta, em um anel aromáti- co tetrassubstituído. Observaram-se singletos em δH 5,47, 3,83, 3,82 e 3,55, indicando a presença de um hidrogênio olefínico e três metoxilas, sendo duas aromáticas e uma sobre sistema insaturado, respectivamente. Foi verificado um dubleto em δH 0,89 (6,5 Hz) e um multipleto em δH 2,68, indicativo da presença de uma metila e um hidrogênio metínico. O espectro de RMN de 1H também registrou dois duplos dubletos em δH 2,33 (dd, J= 17,0 e 5,0 Hz) e δH 2,99 (dd, J=17,0 e 13,0 Hz) com δC 40,1, evidencian- do tratar-se de um metileno α a um centro estereogênico e a uma carbonila α,β insaturada. O espectro de RMN de 13C indicou a presença de 17 átomos de carbono, dos quais seis foram atribuí- dos como sendo do tipo aromático (δC 176,1; 170,4; 159,1; 104,4; 93,3 e 88,6), dois carbonos sp2 em δC 171,3 e 104,8, dois carbo- nos carbonílicos em δC 197,3 e 192,4, três metoxilas atribuídas aos sinais em δC 56,6, 56,1 e 56,1, uma metila em δC 14,2, um metino em δC 36,6, um carbono metilênico em δC 40,1 e um car- bono quaternário em δC 89,9. Através da análise detalhada do mapa de contorno gHMQC foi possível atribuir os hidrogênios aos respectivos átomos de carbono. Pela análise do mapa de con- torno gHMBC observaram-se as correlações entre H-5↔C-3a/C- 7a/C-7/C-6, H-7↔C-3a/C-4/C-5/C-6, 4-OCH3↔C-4* ou C-6*, 6-OCH3↔ C-4* ou C-6* (*podem estar trocados), H-3’↔C-1’/ C-2’/C-4’, 2’OCH3↔C-2’, 6’-CH3↔C-6’/C-5’/C-1’, Ha5’↔C-4’/ C-6’/C-1’, Hb-5’↔C-4’/C-6’/CH3-6’ e H-6’↔C-1’, os quais con- firmaram 3 como 7-decloro-griseofulvina. A configuração relati- va de 3 foi determinada por comparação dos valores dos desloca- mentos em RMN de 1H, 13C, constantes de acoplamentos e com- paração com dados da literatura12. Após experimento de rotação ótica, que forneceu [α]D 25 = + 146,1 (c. 0,0035 em CHCl3), foi possível identificar esta substância como (+)-7-decloro- griseofulvina. Os valores dos deslocamentos químicos da 7- decloro-griseofulvina (3) estão apresentados na Tabela 2. Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 5 foram comparados com os espectros obtidos para 3 e foi possível notar a grande semelhan- ça no perfil espectral destas duas substâncias, sendo a diferença marcante a ausência de um dubleto na região de aromático e a presença de apenas um sinal, na forma de singleto, nesta região (δH 6,07). Este fato sugeriu a presença de um anel aromático pentassubstituído em C-7. O espectro de massas de 5 obtido pela técnica EM-ES a +35 V forneceu os picos m/z 375, indicando o aduto com sódio ([M + Na]+), m/z 353 [M + H]+ e m/z 377 [M+2]+ evidenciando a presença de um átomo de cloro, sugerindo estar posicionado em C-7. Estas informações aliadas à comparação com a literatura12 conduziram à estrutura da griseofulvina (C17H17ClO6). A rotação ótica de 5 foi medida e o [α]D = +104 (c. 0,0035 em acetona) permitiu identificar a substância como (+)-griseofulvina. Os valores dos deslocamentos químicos da griseofulvina (5) estão apresentados na Tabela 2. Tabela 3.

Vol. 28, No. 6 a primeira vez como substâncias produzidas por um fungo endofítico. A produção das substâncias 1 e 2 com atividade frente aos fun- gos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum por Xylaria sp. dá indícios de que os endófitos associados com Palicourea marcgravii se encontram em uma relação de simbiose, produzindo substâncias antifúngicas contra possíveis fungos fitopatogênicos. Os resultados encontrados até o momento evidenciam a potencialidade destes microrganismos e reforçam a necessidade do estudo químico biomonitorado neste nicho de fungos.

The phytochemical investigation of the flowers of Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae) resulted in the isolation and identification of nine phenolic derivatives, quercetin 3-O-sophoroside, taxifolin, astilbin, ourateacatechin, caffeic, ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic and gallic acid, besides two guanidine alkaloids, pterogynine, pterogynidine. This is the first time these compounds have been reported in P. nitens flowers. As this is a monospecific genus, these secondary metabolites may have taxonomical significance.

INTRODUÇÃO Pterogyne nitens Tulasne (Fabaceae – Caesalpinioideae), uma espécie pertencente a um gênero monoespecífico, é popularmente conhecida como “amendoim-do-campo”, “amendoim-bravo”, “bál- samo”, “yvi-raró”, “cocal”, “tipa” etc. Na América Latina essa espécie arbórea ocorre na Argentina, Bolívia, Paraguai e Brasil. No território brasileiro ocorre com freqüência na região de Mata Atlântica e Cerrado compreendida entre o Ceará até o Paraná.1 “Amendoim-bravo”, como é popularmente conhecida no esta- do de São Paulo, é amplamente empregada na construção civil de- vido às características da sua madeira moderadamente densa e re- sistente.2 P. nitens também conhecida pela beleza e odor de suas flores, bem como pela intensidade de suas folhagens e frutificação possui grande valor ornamental sendo, portanto, recomendada para arborização de vias urbanas e rodovias e na reposição de mata ciliar em locais com inundações periódicas. Esta espécie habita os re- manescentes de vegetação paulista e encontra-se sob risco de extinção, fazendo parte da lista de espécies recomendadas para a conservação genética no estado de São Paulo.3 A literatura apresenta poucos dados das aplicações medicinais e da constituição química de P. nitens. Estudos etnofarmacológicos em comunidades guaranis do nordeste da Argentina revelam o uso das cascas do caule no tratamento de infestações parasitárias, prin- cipalmente no combate ao “tacho”, nome popular de Ascaris lumbricoides.4 Em trabalhos fitoquímicos anteriores, foram isola- dos cinco alcalóides guanidínicos das folhas e caules de P. nitens, os quais mostraram atividade citotóxica sobre linhagens mutantes de Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sugerindo atividade antitumoral po- tencial desses alcalóides.5 Dada a emergência de preservação da espécie ameaçada de extinção, o estudo sobre a composição micromolecular das flores de P. nitens foi bastante significativo para o registro do perfil meta- bólico da espécie. Desse estudo foram isolados e identificados onze constituintes: quatro flavonóides, quatro derivados do ácido cinâmico, dois alcalóides guanidínicos e o ácido gálico. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A identificação de todas as substâncias foi realizada com base na comparação de dados espectroscópicos de RMN de 1H, RMN de 13C, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY 1D e comparação desses dados com aqueles disponíveis na literatura. A análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracte- rizar as substâncias 1-4 como derivados do ácido cinâmico, com uma feição comum caracterizada por um par de dubletos entre δH 7,58-7,49 (J= 16,0 Hz; 1H) e δH 6,40-6,13 (J= 16,0 Hz; 1H), típi- cos do sistema trans-alceno de derivados aromáticos C6-C3. Os de- mais valores atribuídos aos sinais correspondentes ao anel aromá- tico demonstram sutis diferenças na série 1-4. Os sinais em δH 7,12 (d, J= 2,5 Hz), δH 7,04 (dd, J= 2,5 e 8,5 Hz) e δH 6,85 (d, J= 8,5 Hz) observados no espectro de RMN de 1H de 1 foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2, H-6 e H-5, respectivamente. Esses dados suge- rem a presença de um anel aromático 1,3,4-trissubstituído, permi- tindo concluir que o derivado de ácido cinâmico em análise é o ácido cafeico.6 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C da substância 2 apresentaram o mesmo perfil de sinais daqueles observados para 1, exceto pela presença do singleto em δH 3,90 (3H), atribuído a uma metoxila. A 803 Constituintes químicos das flores de Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae)# Vol. 31, No. 4 ligação do grupo metoxílico ao anel aromático foi estabelecida pela correlação observada entre os sinais em δH 3,90 (OCH3) e 147,9 (C-3), no mapa de contornos gHMBC. Assim, a substância 2 pôde ser caracterizada como sendo ácido ferúlico.7 Os espectros de RMN de 1H da substância 3 apresentaram dois singletos δH 6,98 (2H) e δH 3,80 (6H), os quais foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios metínicos H-2 e H-6 e aos dois grupos metoxílicos, respectivamente. Os de- mais dados espectrais confirmaram a posição dos dois grupos metoxílicos nos carbonos C-3 e C-5 e permitiram identificar a es- trutura molecular de 3 como sendo ácido sinápico.8 Os dados dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 4 foram quase similares àqueles observados para o ácido cafeico 1. Na estrutura de 4, além dos sinais de uma unidade de ácido cafeico analisados a partir dos es- pectros de RMN de 13C, foram diagnosticados um conjunto de si- nais compatíveis com uma unidade de ácido quínico. O espectro de RMN de 1H apresentou sinais para três hidrogênios metínicos em δH 3,56 (dd, J= 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-4), 3,92 (d, J= 3,5 Hz, H-4) e 5,06 (td, J= 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-5) e para hidrogênios metilênicos na região compreendida entre δH 1,08 e 1,99 (H-2 e H-6), os quais confirmaram a presença de uma unidade derivada do ácido quínico. A ligação do grupo cafeoíla à unidade de ácido quínico foi estabelecida pela correlação observada entre os sinais em δH 5,06 (H-5) e δC 165,7 (C-9’), no mapa de contornos gHMBC. Os valores observados para os acoplamentos de H-4 com H-3 e H-5 indicaram uma relação axial-equatorial entre H-4 e H-3 (J= 3,5 Hz) e axial- axial entre H-4 e H-5 (J = 10,0 Hz) confirmando as posições diequatoriais para os grupos cafeoíla e a hidroxila (4-OH). Os ex- perimentos de NOESY 1D mostraram um aumento na intensidade do sinal em δH 3,92 (H-3) pela irradiação do sinal atribuído ao hidrogênio H-4 (3,56) e ausência de NOE quando da irradiação do sinal em δH 5,06 (H-5), consolidando a configuração relativa pro- posta. Tais informações foram confirmadas com dados da literatu- ra, indicando que a estrutura de 4 corresponde ao ácido 5-O- cafeoilquínico.9 Os dados obtidos dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiram caracterizar a substância 5 como sendo ácido gálico.10 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiram inferir que a substância 6 pertence à classe dos flavonóides. Entre outras fei- ções destacam-se o conjunto de sinais do espectro de 13C em δC 73,6, 85,0 e 198,3 atribuídos aos carbonos C-3, C-2 e C-4, respec- tivamente, indicando que 6 possui a estrutura de um diidroflavonol. Um par de dubletos em δH 5,91 (J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) e δH 5,88 (J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) foram atribuídos ao anel A 5,7,9,10-tetrassubstituído. Os sinais em δH 6,96 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H), δH 6,80 (d, J= 8,0 Hz, 1H) e δH 6,84 (dd, J= 2,0 e 8,0 Hz, 1H) corroboram o padrão 1,3,4- trissubstituído para o anel B. Ainda o espectro de RMN de 1H de 6 apresentou um par de dubletos em δH 4,90 (J= 12,0 Hz, 1H) e 4,49 (J= 12,0 Hz, 1H), os quais foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2 e H-3, respectivamente. A constante de acoplamento apresentada por estes dois dubletos (J= 12 Hz) sugere um acoplamento do tipo axial- axial, conduzindo à proposição de que o anel B e o grupo hidroxila 3-OH mantém uma relação anti. Estes dados analisados em conso- nância com os de RMN de 13C permitiram caracterizar 6 como sendo taxifolina.11 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 7 indica- ram uma estreita similaridade entre 6 e 7. A única diferença notada entre os espectros das duas substâncias refere-se aos sinais carac- terísticos de uma unidade glicosídica em 7. O sinal em δC 17,8, atribuído ao carbono metílico C-6” e o conjunto de sinais em δC 100,1 (C-1”), 71,7 (C-4”), 70,4 (C-3”), 70,1 (C-2”) e 69,0 (C-5”) permitiram caracterizar a unidade monosídica como sendo uma ramnose. O espectro de RMN de 1H demonstrou a presença de um dubleto em δH 4,04 que foi atribuído ao hidrogênio anomérico H- 1”, cuja constante de acoplamento de 1,5 Hz inferiu a configura- ção α para a unidade de ramnose. A correlação deste dubleto e o sinal em δC 75,7, atribuído ao carbono C-3, observada no mapa de contornos gHMBC, sugeriu que a unidade de ramnose se encontra ligada ao carbono C-3. Os dados espectroscópicos analisados para 7 indicaram tratar-se da estrutura da astilbina.12 A análise polarimétrica dos diidroflavonóis 6 e 7 indicou valores de rotação óptica específica de +17o (c= 1,02 MeOH, 27 oC) e –22 o (c= 0,82, MeOH, 27 oC), respectivamente. Esses dados sugerem as configu- rações absolutas R,R dos carbonos C-2 e C-3 presentes nas estrutu- ras moleculares de 6 e 7, os quais se mostraram compatíveis com os valores descritos na literatura.13 O espectro de RMN de 1H da substância 8 apresentou três si- nais característicos de hidrogênios aromáticos: δH 6,53 (s, 2H), 5,93 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) e 5,95 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) indicando tratar-se também de um flavonóide. Os sinais correspondentes a dois hidro- gênios metilênicos em δH 2,72 (dd, J= 3,0 e 17,0 Hz) e δH 2,86 (dd, J= 5,0 e 17,0 Hz) foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-4a e H-4b, respectivamente e permitiram atribuir a estrutura de uma catequina para 8. Os sinais relativos aos carbonos entre δC 100,1 e 157,9 e 29,1 analisados em conjunção com as correlações observadas no mapa de contornos gCOSY para os hidrogênios H-4a, H-4b e H-3 ajudaram a confirmar a proposição de uma catequina para 8. Os experimentos de NOESY 1D foram empregados visando confir- mar a estereoquímica relativa de C-2 e C-3. A irradiação em δH 2,73 (H-4a) causou aumento na intensidade do sinal em δH 4,19 (m, H-3). A irradiação do sinal em δH 2,86 (H-4b) também levou ao aumento de intensidade em δH 4,19 (H-3), indicando a proximi- dade destes hidrogênios. No entanto, pela intensidade dos NOE observados os sinais em δH 2,86 (H-4b) e δH 4,19 (H-3) estão posicionados na mesma face do plano do anel ao qual estão liga- dos. A irradiação do sinal em δH 2,73 (H-4a) também causou um incremento em δH 4,78 (sl, H-2), indicando uma correlação 1,3- diaxial entre H-4a e H-2. Ao irradiar-se o sinal em δH 4,19 (H-3), houve um ganho de intensidade em δH 4,78 (H-2) e δH 2,73 (H-4a) coerente com uma relação sin entre H-2, H-3 e H-4a. Estes dados analisados em consonância com as constantes de acoplamento destes sinais permitiram atribuir a configuração relativa proposta. O mapa de contornos gHMBC demonstrou uma intensa correlação entre o si- nal em δH 3,80 (s, 3H), atribuído a um hidrogênio metoxílico e o sinal em δC 136,0, o qual está relacionado ao carbono C-4’, sugerindo que o grupo metoxila se encontra ligado ao carbono C-4’. A medida da rota- ção óptica específica de 8 [α]D 27 = -58o (c= 1,22, acetona) indicou as 804 Quim. Nova Regasini et al. configurações R e R dos carbonos C-2 e C-3, similares aos valores encontrados para a epigalocatequina.14 Os dados apresentados são com- patíveis com estrutura da ourateacatequina,15 confirmando sua identi- dade com 8. A análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracte- rizar a substância 9 também como um flavonóide. O espectro de RMN de 13C apresentou os sinais em δC 177,3, 155,4 e 132,9 atri- buídos aos carbonos C-4, C-2 e C-3, respectivamente, evidencian- do a subclasse dos flavonóis. Os sinais em δC 144,7 e 148,7 atribu- ídos aos carbonos C-3’ e C-4’, respectivamente, evidenciaram um flavonol cujo anel B encontra-se 1’,3’,4’-trissubstituído. Adicio- nalmente, os sinais de RMN de 13C compreendidos entre δC 60,6 e δC 82,6 analisados com os sinais de RMN de 1H em δH 5,66 (d, J= 7,5 Hz, 1H) e δH 4,58 (d, J=7,5 Hz, 1H) correspondentes a dois hidrogênios anoméricos indicaram duas subunidades de glicose e, com base no valor da constante de acoplamento (J= 7,5 Hz) para estes dois dubletos, verificou-se tratar de duas subunidades de β- glicose. Os experimentos de gHMBC demonstraram duas correla- ções entre os dubletos em δH 5,66 e δH 4,58 atribuídos aos hidrogê- nios anoméricos H-1” e H-1’”, respectivamente, e o sinal em δH 82,6 sugerindo que a ligação interglicosídica seja do tipo 2”’→1’”. O mapa de contornos gHMBC de 9 também apresentou uma corre- lação entre o sinal em δC 132,9 atribuído ao carbono C-3 e o dubleto em δC 5,66, levando à conclusão que a posição de O-glicosilação se encontra em C-3. Pelos dados obtidos pode-se caracterizar 9 como sendo quercetina 3-O-soforosídeo.16 Análise dos dados de RMN de 13C das substância 10 e 11 indi- cou tratar-se de alcalóides de estruturas bastante similares. Entre outras características destacam-se a presença de sinais em torno de δC 155,7 e 156,9 (C-2) típico de carbono guanidínico e um conjun- to de cinco sinais relacionados às subunidades isoprenílicas em torno de δC 17,8/17,7; δC 25,2/25,1; δC 39,0/38,7; δC 119,2/119,0 e δC 135,8/136,0. A análise desses dados indicou que 10 e 11 contêm um núcleo guanidínico substituído por unidades hemiterpenoídicas. Dado evidenciado por dois singletos em δH 1,62 (H-4’) e δH 1,68 (H-5’) atribuídos aos hidrogênios dos grupos metílicos; um dubleto em δH 3,72 (d, J= 6,5, H-1’) e um tripleto em δH 5,16 (t, J= 6,5, H- 2’) relacionados aos hidrogênios metilênicos e metínico, respecti- vamente, para 10. Da mesma forma, dados similares caracteriza- ram a estrutura de 11, indicando que as estruturas em questão se tratam de alcalóides guanidino-prenilados. A única diferença entre os alcalóides 10 e 11 deve-se ao padrão de substituição do núcleo guanidínico. No alcalóide 10 o sinal δH 3,72 (J= 6,5 Hz), atribuído aos hidrogênios H-1’, apresenta-se como um dubleto devido ao acoplamento com H-2’. Adicionalmente, a ausência do hidrogênio azometínico na estrutura alcaloídica indicou o padrão N,N- dissubstituído para 10, que foi caracterizado como sendo a pteroginina.17 No alcalóide 11, a presença de um tripleto em δH 7,72 (t, J= 6,5, 1H) devido ao acoplamento do hidrogênio azometínico do núcleo guanidínico com H-1’ da unidade hemiterpênica indicou que a substituição terpênica ocorre nos ni- trogênios vicinais da estrutura guanidínica. Análise de todos os dados indica que 11 possui padrão N,N’ de substituição isoprenílica. Fundamentado nestas análises, a substância 11 foi caracterizada como a pteroginidina,5 um isômero constitucional do alcalóide 10. As substâncias 1-11 foram avaliadas quanto à sua capacidade de inibição sobre mieloperoxidase (MPO), uma heme-enzima abun- dante em polimorfonucleares (PMNs), e considerada uma macromolécula-chave na resposta imunológica inespecífica a vári- os agentes invasores, principalmente bactérias. A MPO é respon- sável pela conversão de peróxido de hidrogênio (H2O2) e ânions cloreto em água e ácido hipocloroso (HOCl) que, por sua vez, atua como um potente agente antimicrobiano. Além disso, o excesso da atividade de MPO e subseqüente produção exagerada de HOCl culmina em um intenso estresse oxidativo para os PMNs. A litera- tura correlaciona essa injúria oxidativa promovida por MPO e HOCl com inúmeros processos inflamatórios, tais como artritite reumatóide, fibrose cística, doença inflamatória intestinal (IBD), injúria pulmonar neonatal, etc. Dessa forma, a busca por inibidores de MPO a partir de fontes naturais torna-se de grande valia na descoberta de novos agentes anti-inflamatórios.18 Dentre as substâncias ensaiadas com MPO, apenas as substân- cias 5 e 9 mostraram-se ativas, exibindo CI50 de 17,5 e 3,72 nM, quando comparadas à quercetina, utilizada como controle positi- vo, que apresentou uma CI50 de 1,22 nM. O valor de CI50 da quercetina apresenta-se inferior àquele observado para o seu glicosídeo 9, sugerindo a importância de uma hidroxila livre na posição 3 para atividade de inibição de MPO. As demais substân- cias mostraram-se inativas (CI50 > 100 nM), incluindo a substância 6, um análogo hidrogenado da quercetina. Essa observação sugere que uma insaturação situada entre os carbonos C-2 e C-3 no núcleo flavonoídico para uma ação inibitória sobe MPO. Os extratos e frações obtidas das flores de P. nitens tiveram sua capacidade antioxidante avaliada no ensaio em cromatoplacas re- veladas com β-caroteno, mostrando-se ativos, uma vez que manti- veram a coloração laranja nos pontos de aplicação. As substâncias fenólicas isoladas neste estudo são provavelmente as responsáveis pela atividade antioxidante dessas frações detectadas pelo teste preliminar com β-caroteno e que foi anteriormente relatado por Cai e colaboradores, que demonstraram a capacidade seqüestrado- ra de radicais livres das substâncias 1-9 nos ensaios com DPPH (2,2-difenil-1-picrilidrazila) e ABTS [2,2’-azino-di-(3-etillben- zotiazolina-6-ácido sulfônico)].19 A atividade seqüestradora de ra- dicais exibida pelos derivados fenólicos vem sendo amplamente discutida na literatura e está correlacionada a fatores mesoméricos que conferem a esse grupo funcional uma alta reatividade como doadores de elétrons.20 Os alcalóides guanidínicos 10 e 11 tiveram seu poder antioxidante avaliado sobre os radicais DPPH e ABTS. Os resultados indicaram que os alcalóides são inativos no teste com DPPH (CI50 > 200 μM) e mostraram atividade baixa sobre o radical ABTS, apresentando CI50 de 87,7 e 190,0 μM, tendo a quercetina como controle positivo (CI50 de 7,64 e 3,12 μM para os radicais DPPH e ABTS, respectivamente). O estudo químico das flores de P. nitens culminou no isola- mento de onze substâncias de três classes químicas distintas: flavonóides (flavonóis, diidroflavonóis e catequinas), derivados do ácido cinâmico e alcalóides. Dentre esses, somente as substâncias 10 e 11 já haviam sido relatadas como pertencentes ao metaboloma de P. nitens. Este trabalho permitiu concluir ainda que os metabólitos secundários acumulados nas flores desta espécie são predominan- temente de natureza fenólica. A descrição dos constituintes acu- mulados em P. nitens é também de grande valia tendo em conta que sua madeira vem sendo empregada indiscriminadamente pela construção civil e, por tratar-se de um gênero monoespecífico, esta leguminosa está seriamente ameaçada de extinção.2 PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectrômetro Varian INOVA-500® operando a 500 MHz para o núcleo de 1H e 125 MHz para o núcleo de 13C, TMS foi utilizado como referência interna. Os dados de rotação óptica foram obtidos em polarímento Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena®. As análises por CLAE no modo analítico foram realizadas em equi- 805 Constituintes químicos das flores de Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae)# Vol. 31, No. 4 pamento ProStar/Varian® acoplado ao detector ProStar 330® de ar- ranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analítica Phenomenex® Fenil- Hexila (250 x 4,60 mm; 5 µm). No modo preparativo, as análises por CLAE foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar/Varian® acoplado ao detector ProStar-UV®, utilizando-se coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexila (250 x 21,2 mm; 10 μm). Nas separa- ções em coluna aberta foram utilizadas gel de sílica derivatizado C-18 (40-63 μm, Merck®), gel de sílica para cromatografia flash (35-70 μm) e para cromatografia de exclusão molecular (Sephadex,® LH-20). As análises por cromatografia em camada delgada foram realizadas com cromatoplacas de gel de sílica G60 (0,25 mm). Após o desenvolvimento das cromatoplacas estas foram visualizadas sob luz ultravioleta (λ = 254 e 365 nm) e reveladas com solução de anisaldeído em ácido sulfúrico seguido de aquecimento. Material vegetal As flores de P. nitens foram coletadas no Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo – SP, no mês de abril de 2003, pela Dra. M. C. M. Young. O material botânico foi identificado como sendo Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae – Caesalpinoideae) pela Dra. I. Cordeiro, do mesmo Ins- tituto. Uma exsicata (SP204319) encontra-se depositada no herbário “Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann” do Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo - SP. Extração e isolamento As flores (1,8 kg) foram secas à temperatura ambiente por 15 dias e, posteriormente, submetidas à moagem empregando moi- nho de facas. O pó obtido (1,5 kg) foi levado à maceração empre- gando hexanos e posteriormente maceração em etanol. Após eva- poração, o extrato hexânico (3,8 g) foi analisado por RMN de 1H e CCDC mostrando tratar-se de uma mistura complexa de terpenos. O extrato etanólico (15,0 g) foi dissolvido em uma mistura de metanol:água (7:3) e posteriormente submetido à partição líquido- líquido empregando acetato de etila e n-butanol. A fração AcOEt (3,8 g) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna de permeação em gel (Sephadex®, LH-20, 180 x 5 cm), eluída em MeOH, obtendo-se 25 subfrações de 75 mL. A subfração AcOEt-17 (143,0 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia flash em coluna de gel de sílica (28 x 3 cm), eluída em modo gradiente (CHCl3:MeOH, 100 a 50%), obtendo-se os ácidos cafeico (1; 12, 0 mg), ferúlico (2; 14,0 mg) e sinápico (3, 7,0 mg). A subfração AcOEt-20 (79 mg) foi subme- tida à cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (8 x 3 cm) empregando misturas de MeOH:H2O (30 a 80%), resultando no isolamento de dois flavonóides, taxifolina (6, 14 mg) e ourateacatequina (8, 15 mg). A fração n-butanólica (3,0 g) foi submetida à cromatografia por exclusão molecular (LH-20, Sephadex, 180 x 5 cm) eluída em MeOH, resultando em 22 subfrações de 70 mL. A subfração BuOH- 7 (280 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna de gel de sílica (28 x 4 cm), eluída em misturas de CHCl3:MeOH (10 a 30%), obtendo-se dois alcalóides guanidínicos, pteroginina (10, 98 mg) e pteroginidina (11, 90 mg). A subfração BuOH-12 (120 mg) foi sub- metida à cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (10 x 3 cm), eluída em MeOH:H2O (1:1), obtendo-se astilbina (7, 27 mg). A subfração BuOH-18 (97 mg) foi submetida à CLAE-UV preparativo [MeOH:H2O (56:44), λ = 254 nm, fluxo = 11,0 mL/min), culmi- nando no isolamento do flavonol glicosilado (9, 18 mg). A fração hidroalcoólica (1,7 g) foi inicialmente submetida à cromatografia de permeação em gel (Sephadex®, LH-20, 120 x 8 cm), eluída em MeOH, obtendo-se 13 subfrações de 35 mL. A subfração HA-5 foi identificada como ácido gálico (5, 11 mg) e a subfração HA-12, como sendo o ácido 5-O-cafeoilquínico (4, 22 mg). Atividades antioxidante e inibitória sobre mieloperoxidase (MPO) Para os ensaios em CCD reveladas com β-caroteno, as amos- tras foram eluídas e reveladas com uma solução diclorometânica de β-caroteno a 0,02%. Após revelação, a cromatoplaca foi mantida à exposição de luz solar até total perda de coloração. Os pontos que mantiveram a coloração laranja indicaram a presença de subs- tâncias antioxidantes.21 Os ensaios de capacidade seqüestradora de radicais livres realizados para as substâncias 10 e 11 seguiram pro- tocolos relatados na literatura com pequenas modificações.22 A atividade inibitória sobre MPO das substâncias 1-11 foi avalia- da segundo o método de oxidação do guaiacol. O meio reacional cons- tituído de uma mistura de MPO (8,0 nM), peróxido de hidrogênio (0,3 mM) e guaiacol (70 mM) foi utilizado para a avaliação da ação de MPO na presença das substâncias em estudo e do controle positivo quercetina. As substâncias foram dissolvidas em DMSO nas concen- trações 0,50; 5,0; 10,0; 25,0; 50,0 e 100 nM. Após o tempo de reação (4 h), o meio reacional foi lido em espectrofotômetro (470 nm). A atividade inibitória foi expressa em CI50, valor calculado a partir da plotagem de um gráfico correlacionando velocidade inicial versus absorbância, obtendo-se, assim, as curvas concentração-resposta.23 AGRADECIMENTOS À Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), Programa BIOTA-FAPESP (Instituto Virtual da Biodiversidade, www.biota.org.br), Conselho Nacional de Desen- volvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) e à Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).

An evaluation of the insecticidal activity of the fruits extracts of Trichilia claussenii was carried out and the methanol extract revealed to have strong insecticidal activity. The fractionation of methanol extract of T. claussenii seeds bioassay-guided against Spodoptera frugiperda has led to the identification of the ω-phenylalkyl and alkenyl fatty acids as active compounds in this extract. The structures of the compounds were proposed by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data. Keywords: Trichilia claussenii; ω-phenylalkyl and alkenyl fatty acids; Spodoptera frugiperda. INTRODUÇÃO O milho representa um dos principais cereais em todo mundo e é cultivado em pequenas, médias e grandes propriedades. No Brasil é considerada como cultura de expressão nacional, de grande importância social e econômica, e está presente de norte a sul do País.1 São utilizados, durante o desenvolvimento da cultura, insu mos sintéticos como pesticidas que, além de aumentar os custos de produção, poluem o ambiente e deixam resíduos nos alimentos. O controle de pragas é uma das atividades de importância econômica que deve ser bem planejada para a obtenção de maiores rendimentos econômicos.2 A lagarta-do-cartucho, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), destaca-se como importante praga do milho, tanto pela redução da produtividade e da qualidade do produto final, quanto pela dificuldade de controle.2,3 Um dos primeiros relatos da atividade inseticida de Trichilia spp. sobre S. frugiperda foi feito por Mikolajczak e Reed.4 Expe rimentos realizados adicionando extratos aquosos de T. casaretti, T. catigua, T. claussenii, T. elegans e T. pallida à dieta artificial afetaram o desenvolvimento das lagartas de S. frugiperda.5 Ex tratos orgânicos das folhas, ramos e frutos de T. claussenii e dos frutos de T. catigua, T. elegans foram avaliados sobre S. frugiperda em condições de laboratório.6,7 Os extratos hexânico e metanólico de folhas e o hexânico de ramos de T. claussenii foram os mais eficientes, apresentando alta taxa de mortalidade larval (superior a 60,0%).6 Dentre os frutos, os melhores resultados foram apre sentados pelos extratos hexânico e metanólico de T. elegans com mortalidade larval de 100,0%.7 O estudo químico das folhas de T. claussenii resultou no isola mento de um cicloartano, uma mistura de ácidos w-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos, aminoácidos e um sesquiterpeno;8 dos galhos foram isolados esteroides pregnanos e sesquiterpenos9 e, dos frutos, novas g-lactonas.10 Em vista do exposto, desenvolveu-se este trabalho com o objetivo de avaliar a bioatividade de extratos orgânicos e dos constituintes químicos dos frutos de T. claussenii sobre S. frugiperda. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C foram obtidos em espectrômetro Bruker DRX operando a 400 MHz para 1H, utilizando-se CDCl3 como solvente e TMS como padrão interno. As separações cromatográficas em colunas foram realizadas utilizando-se gel de sílica 60, 70-230, 230-400 mesh. As análises cro matográficas em camada fina foram realizadas em cromatoplacas de sílica gel F254 sobre placa de alumínio Merck, de 0,2 mm de espessura, empregando-se como revelador a solução de vanilina/ácido sulfúrico. Para identificação dos ésteres metílicos do conjunto dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos foi utilizado cromatógrafo gasoso acoplado ao espectrômetro de massas, marca Shimadzu, modelo QP-5000, com coluna capilar DB-5 (30 m x 0,25 mm x 0,15 μm), utilizando as seguintes condições: temperatura do detector: 280 °C, injetor: 250 °C, gás de arraste: He, temperatura inicial do forno: 70°C por 2 min, velocidade de aquecimento a 10 °C/min até 290 °C, permanecendo nessa temperatura por 20 min. O espectro de massas foi obtido por impacto de elétrons a 70 eV. Material vegetal Os frutos de T. claussenii foram coletados em Piracicaba/SP no Campus da Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz”/USP, e identificados pelo botânico Dr. R. R. Rodrigues. Uma exsicata foi depositada no herbário da Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz” sob o número 7395. Preparação dos extratos Os frutos de T. claussenii foram secos em estufa de circulação de ar a 40 °C, por aproximadamente 7 dias e posteriormente separados em cascas do fruto (pericarpo, TCCF, 56,8 g), cascas da semente (arilo, TCCS, 7,90 g), semente (TCS, 35,1 g). A extração das partes dos frutos de T. claussenii foi realizada por maceração a tempera tura ambiente e em repouso, com solventes em ordem crescente de polaridade (hexano, MeOH e MeOH/água 1:1). As soluções obtidas Nebo et al. 1850 Quim. Nova foram concentradas por destilação do solvente em evaporador rotati vo, fornecendo os extratos hexânico, metanólico e hidrometanólico, respectivamente. Os extratos foram submetidos a ensaios de toxici dade sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho do milho, S. frugiperda, e os que apresentaram atividade foram fracionados. Ensaio de toxicidade Os ensaios biológicos sobre S. frugiperda foram realizados no Laboratório de Bioensaios do Departamento de Química da UFSCar, a 25 ± 1 °C, UR de 70 ± 5% e fotofase de 12 h. Para realização dos testes, a criação de S. frugiperda (J. E. Smith) foi mantida em labo ratório, sendo as lagartas alimentadas com dieta artificial e os adultos com solução de mel a 10%.11 Os ensaios de toxicidade basearam-se na metodologia descrita por Paula et al..12 Para realização dos bioensaios, foram preparadas solu ções das amostras em acetona e/ou água. Foram utilizados grupos de 10 larvas de S. frugiperda no segundo instar (5 dias), onde cada grupo foi transferido para placas de Petri. As médias dos pesos dos grupos de insetos foram obtidas pelas medidas realizadas em balança analítica. Em cada inseto, 1 μL da solução em acetona ou água foi aplicado topicamente, via uma microsseringa. Para evitar a possível morte do inseto, em cada grupo de larvas foi colocada pequena porção (300,0 mg) da dieta artificial. Este processo foi realizado 1 h após a aplicação da solução. O controle consistiu na aplicação de 1 μL de acetona ou água em cada inseto e foi realizado utilizando as mesmas condições descritas anteriormente. Todos os experimentos e o respectivo controle foram realizados em triplicata. Todos os ensaios foram realizados na concentração de 10 mg/mL e a mortalidade dos insetos foi verificada após 48 h. Os resultados foram expressos em média da porcentagem da mortalidade e analisados utilizando-se a análise de variância (ANOVA), sendo usado P < 0,05 como nível de significância. Isolamento e identificação dos constituintes químicos de T. claussenii O extrato metanólico das sementes de T. claussenii (TCSM, 4,54 g) foi suspenso em uma mistura MeOH/H2O (7:3) e particio nado sucessivamente com hexano, CH2Cl2, AcOEt e MeOH/H2O, obtendo-se após a evaporação dos solventes as frações: TCSM1 = 0,37 g ; TCSM2 = 0,06 g ; TCSM3 = 1,00 g e TCSM4 = 3,10 g, respectivamente. As frações obtidas foram submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade sobre S. frugiperda. A fração bioativa TCSM1 (0,37 g) foi fracionada em coluna de gel de sílica (70-230 mesh) empregando-se como eluentes: hexano 100%, hexano/AcOEt (99:1/98:2/95:5/9:1/8: 2/7:3/1:1), AcOEt 100%, AcOEt/MeOH (99:1/98:2/95:5/9:1/8:2/7:3 /1:1) e MeOH 100%; as frações obtidas foram reunidas em 6 frações (TCSM1-1 a TCSM1-6) com base na semelhança revelada pela aná lise por cromatografia em camada fina e, posteriormente, submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade. As sub-frações bioativas TCSM1-3 (0,05 g) e TCSM1-4 (0,20 g) foram fracionadas em gel de sílica (70-230 mesh), utilizando como eluente hexano/AcOEt/MeOH (hexano/ AcOEt (8:2/7:3/1:1), AcOEt 100%, AcOEt/MeOH (99:1/98:2/95:5/9: 1/8:2/7:3/1:1) e MeOH 100%) em gradiente de polaridade crescente. Através das similaridades cromatográficas as frações foram reuni das e submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade. As sub-frações biotivas TCSM1-3-2 (0,006 g) e TCSM1-4-4 (0,01 g) foram identificadas como mistura dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos através da análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e por comparação com os dados da literatura. Para identificação do tamanho das cadeias metilênicas dos ácidos, uma pequena alíquota das amostras foi esterificada com diazometano como descrito por Leonard et al.,13 fornecendo os ésteres metílicos identificados via CG/EM e por comparação com a literatura. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO Inicialmente, os extratos orgânicos das cascas dos frutos (TCCF, pericarpo), cascas das sementes (TCCS, arilo) e sementes (TCS) de T. claussenii foram submetidos a ensaios de toxicidade sobre S. frugi perda. Os resultados iniciais mostraram que o extrato metanólico das sementes de T. claussenii (TCSM) provocou a mais alta porcentagem de mortalidade (64,0%, Figura 1). O extrato TCSM foi então fracionado, fornecendo as frações he xano (TCSM-1), diclorometano (TCSM-2), acetato de etila (TCSM-3) e hidrometanólico (TCSM-4). Entretanto, somente a fração TCSM-1 apresentou atividade relevante com 70,0% de mortalidade sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho (Tabela 1). O fracionamento biomonitorado da fração TCSM-1 levou às sub- frações bioativas TCSM-1-3-2 (59,0% de mortalidade) e TCSM-1-4-4 (73,3% de mortalidade) (Tabela 1). Os espectros de RMN de 1H das frações TCSM-1-4-4 e TCSM- 1-3-2 evidenciaram a presença de ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alque noicos nestas frações através dos sinais observados entre δH 7,15-7,28 (m) indicativos de hidrogênios ligados aos anéis aromáticos; dois tripletos em δH 2,59 e δH 2,24 referente aos hidrogênios das posições benzílicas e α-carbonílicos, respectivamente; sinais em δH 1,20-2,00 (m) característicos de hidrogênios de cadeia metilênica e um sinal em δH 5,34 (t) referente aos hidrogênios ligados às ligações duplas. A ausência de sinais entre δH 3,50 e δH 4,50 indica que não estão Figura 1.

Esses dados para os ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos são equivalentes aos relatados anteriormente.8,14 Para identificação dos constituintes minoritários (ácidos graxos), do tamanho das cadeias metilênicas dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos e localização da posição da ligação dupla dos últimos, uma pequena alíquota das frações TCSM-1-4-4 e TCSM-1-3-2 foi esterifica da com diazometano13 e, posteriormente, analisada via CG-EM. Através da comparação dos espectros de massas com os dados da biblioteca do CG-EM e da literatura,8,14 foi possível propor os tamanhos das cadeias metilênicas desses ácidos que variaram entre 10 a 15 carbonos (Figura 2, Tabela 2). Foi possível propor também a localização da ligação dupla dos ácidos ω-fenil alquenoicos entre os carbonos δ-ε em relação ao grupo fenila. Os ácidos ω-fenil alquenoicos apresentaram como pico base m/z 104, oriundo da fragmentação do tipo McLafferty da ligação dupla (Esquema 1). O cromatograma da fração bioativa TCSM-1-4-4 apresentou 39 picos, cujos espectros de massas foram comparados aos da biblioteca de dados do CG-EM e literatura,8,14 resultando na identificação de 18 ácidos que correspondem a 88,9% da porcentagem relativa dos mesmos na fração, sendo 74,8% ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos e 14,1% ácidos graxos (Tabela 2).

Vanderherchen et al.15 sintetizaram substâncias da classe de ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e demonstraram a atividade dos mesmos em outras espécies de insetos. Ensaios por aplicação tópica foram realizados com os ácidos 7-fenileptanoico e 7-fenilept-4-enoico na dose de 50,0 μg/inseto em lagartas de 4° instar de Manduca sexta (Lepdoptera: Sphingidae), Heliothis virescens (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae) e Helico verpa zea (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae) e foram observados mortalidades na faixa de 55,0 a 70,0%. O modo de ação dos ácidos ω-fenil alca noicos e alquenoicos em lepdópteras ainda é desconhecido. Através do biomonitoramento realizado dos extratos e frações dos frutos de T. claussenii, pôde-se constatar que as substâncias ativas sobre S. frugiperda eram o conjunto dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos. Esse conjunto de ácidos apresenta-se como uma nova classe química de potenciais agentes inseticidas, assim como os limonoides encontrados em meliáceas.16 AGRADECIMENTOS Ao CNPq, à CAPES e FAPESP pelas bolsas e apoios financeiros concedidos.

Extração ácido-base de uma nova porção do extrato bruto etanólico permitiu a identificação do alcalóide liriodenina. Os derivados fenilpropanoídicos e o alcalóide N-acetilnonaina estão sendo descritos pela primeira vez no gênero Michelia. O alcalóide liriodenina e a lignana siringaresinol apresentaram atividade antifúngica moderada. Palavras-chave: Magnoliaceae; Michelia champaca; alcalóides; atividade antifúngica. Introdução Magnoliaceae compreende cerca de 10 gêneros e 220 espécies, sendo que a maioria ocorre no Hemisfério Norte, mas também são encontrados na Ásia (Índia e Malásia) e América do Sul (Brasil). No Brasil são cultivadas várias espécies dos gêneros Magnolia e Michelia, popularmente conhecidas como magnólia amarela [1]. A espécie Michelia champaca aparece como uma planta importante na medicina indígena [2]. É usada pela população para regular a menstruação, combater infecções da garganta e febres, artrites, reumatismos [3], como anticoncepcional [2] e como proteção pós- parto [4]. Estudo farmacológico com o extrato da casca da raiz indicou propriedade inseticida potente contra a larva do mosquito Aedes egyptii [5]. Estudos fitoquímico e biológico com raízes [6], cascas da raiz [7] e folhas [6] de M. champaca levaram ao isolamento de lactonas sesquiterpênicas com significativa atividade antitumoral e permitiram estabelecer o perfil químico deste gênero como essencialmente terpênico [5], com predominância das lactonas sesquiterpênicas. KHAN e colaboradores [4] relatam, com base em triagem fitoquímica, a presença de alcalóides, flavonóides, taninos, saponinas, além de triterpenóides em folhas, sementes, caules e raízes de M. champaca. O flavonóide quercetina foi isolado das flores, pela primeira vez no gênero por KAPOOR e JAGGI [8]. Além da atividade antitumoral descrita anteriormente, alguns autores relatam também atividade antifúngica para a espécie. O extrato metanólico das flores 13 Ecl. Quím., São Paulo, 32(3): 13-18, 2007 de M. champaca mostrou forte atividade frente ao patógeno Staphylococcus aureus [9]. Os extratos diclorometânico e metanólico das folhas apresentaram atividade moderada frente a vários fungos patogênicos e fitopatogênicos [10]. Ainda, sementes, caules e raízes foram bioativos quando ensaiados com fungos patogênicos humanos [4]. Neste trabalho, descrevemos o fracionamento biomonitorado dos caules de M. champaca, buscando isolar e identificar os possíveis metabólitos secundários responsáveis pela atividade antifúngica detectada na fase diclorometânica quando bioensaiadas com os fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. Materiais e Métodos Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em espectrômetro Varian AS 500 (500 MHz para 1H e 125 MHz para 13C). Foram utilizados os solventes deuterados CDCl3, DMSO-d6 e CD3OD, produzidos pela Acros, Aldrich ou CIL, sendo TMS o padrão interno. As colunas cromatográficas tiveram como fase estacionária sílica gel 60 H (70 – 230 mesh, Merck) e sílica C18 (43 – 60 μm). As análises em cromatografia em camada delgada foram realizadas em sílica gel 60 F254 (placa) e as manchas visualizadas por absorção da radiação UV, anisaldeído 2% em H2SO4 seguida de aquecimento, câmara de iodo e solução dragendorff. Os cromatogramas foram obtidos por Cromatografia Líquida de Alta Eficiência (CLAE), num aparelho Varian ProStar, com detector UV-Vis, registrados em microcomputador de 500 MHz com processador Pentium II. Foram utilizadas colunas analíticas Phenomenex Luna C18 (5 ?m, 250 x 4,6 mm) e coluna preparativa Phenomenex Luna C18 (10 μm, 250 x 21,20 mm). Os solventes orgânicos utilizados para obtenção de extratos e fracionamentos foram das marcas Mallinckrodt, Synth e J. T. Baker (grau CLAE). A água (grau CLAE) foi obtida usando um sistema de purificação Milli-Q Plus (Millipore). As soluções foram concentradas em evaporador rotativo Buchi R-114, sob pressão reduzida. Os espectros de massas de baixa resolução foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Platfform, no modo electrospray. Os espectros de infravermelho foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Nicolet-730 FT-IR. Material vegetal Michelia champaca L. (Magnoliaceae) foi coletada no Campus da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), em Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brasil e identificada pela Dra. Inês Cordeiro do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado de São Paulo. Extração e isolamento dos constituintes químicos Os caules M. champaca foram secos à temperatura ambiente, moídos e submetidos à percolação em etanol, resultando no extrato bruto (55,30 g), após evaporação do solvente sob pressão reduzida. O extrato bruto foi solubilizado em MeOH/H2O (70:30, v/v) e submetico à partição com solventes de diferentes polaridades, fornecendo as fases hexânica (9,00 g), diclorometânica (13,04 g), acetato de etila (4,82 g), n-butanólica (11,90 g) e hidroalcóolica (9,08 g). Todas essas fases foram bioensaiadas para averiguação da atividade antifúngica. Parte da fase diclorometânica (6,5 g), a qual foi a única a apresentar atividade, foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna (CC) usando sílica gel (70 – 230 mesh) e eluída com hexano/AcOEt e AcOEt/MeOH em misturas de polaridade crescente, fornecendo 22 frações, após análise por cromatografia em camada delgada. A fração 8 (690 mg, eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 80:20, v/v) foi submetida à CC utilizando sílica de fase reversa C18, eluída com MeOH/H2O em gradiente decrescente de polaridade, obtendo-se 6 frações. A subfração 8.3 (74,2 mg, eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 40:60, v/v) foi submetida a CLAE preparativa em fase reversa C18 (λ = 254 nm, MeOH/H2O 80:20 (v/v), fluxo de 10 mL min-1), 14 Ecl. Quím., São Paulo, 32(3): 13-18, 2007 fornecendo as substâncias 1 (4,6 mg) e 2 (3,7 mg). A fração 7 (420 mg, Hex/AcOEt 10:90, v/v) foi cromatografada em coluna de fase reversa C18, eluída em MeOH/H2O em gradiente crescente de polaridade, obtendo- se 10 frações. A subfração 7.5 (69,6 mg, MeOH/H2O 65:35, v/v) foi submetida a CLAE preparativa λ = 247 nm, MeOH/ H2O 50:50 (v/v), fluxo de 17 mL min-1) e forneceu a substância 3 (9,3 mg). A fração 5 (380 mg, Hex/AcOEt 40:60, v/v) foi também submetida a cromatografia em fase reversa, à vácuo, fornecendo 11 frações. A subfração 5.8 (70,9 mg, MeOH/H2O 80:20, v/v) foi submetida a cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa de fase normal, sendo eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 20:80 (v/v) e fornecendo a substância 4 (8,0 mg), após recristalização em MeOH. Uma nova porção do extrato bruto (25,0 g) foi solubilizada em HCl 5%, após precipitação do material graxo com metanol. Fez-se, em seguida, extração com AcOEt, basificação da fase aquosa e novamente extração com AcOEt [11]. A fração alcaloídica (247,4 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna utilizando C18, eluída em MeOH/H2O em gradiente decrescente de polaridade, fornecendo a substância 5 (14,5 mg, MeOH/H2O 70:30, v/v). Bioensaio antifúngico Estes ensaios foram realizados no laboratório do Instituto de Botânica de São Paulo sob a supervisão da Dra. Maria Cláudia Marx Young. Suspensões contendo esporos dos fungos das espécies Cladosporium cladosporoides e Cladosporium sphaerospermum foram utilizadas como reveladores em cromatografia em camada delgada para a realização da bioautografia [12]. A amostra de extratos foi aplicada em cromatoplacas e eluída com solventes adequados. Após a evaporação dos solventes e localização das manchas por meio de absorção no ultravioleta, uma solução de glicose e sais contendo esporos do fungo foi nebulizada sobre as placas que foram incubadas à temperatura de 25º C em câmara úmida e escura durante 2 a 3 dias. Após o tempo de incubação, observou-se o crescimento do fungo sobre a placa. Nos locais onde existem substâncias fungitóxicas surge um halo de inibição. Foi utilizado nistatina (1 μg) como padrão positivo. Resultados e Discussão As fases hexânica, diclorometânica, acetato de etila, n-butanólica e hidroalcóolica, provenientes da partição líquido-líquido do extrato etanólico, foram bioensaiadas com os fungos Cladosporium cladosporoides e C. sphaerospermum, sendo que apenas a fase diclorometânica apresentou atividade moderada. Esta fase foi, então, fracionada em coluna cromatográfica de fase normal fornecendo dois derivados fenilpropanoídicos, álcool 4-O-β-D-glicopiranosídeo sinapílico (1) e aldeído 4-O-β-D-glicopiranosídeo sinápico (2), uma lignana siringaresinol (3) e um alcalóide N-acetilnonaina (4) (Figura 1). Avaliação prévia do extrato bruto com revelador draggendorff, detectou a ocorrência de alcalóides na matriz vegetal. Assim, o extrato bruto foi submetido a extração ácido-base para obtenção de uma fração rica em alcalóides, que foi fracionada em coluna cromatográfica de fase reversa e levou ao isolamento de liriodenina (5) (Figura 1). As estruturas de todas as substâncias isoladas foram determinadas através de métodos espectroscópicos (EM, IV e RMN de 1H e 13C, uni e bidimensionais) e confirmadas através da comparação com dados da literatura. Todas as substâncias isoladas do extrato ativo e a substância 5 foram submetidas a bioautografia com os fungos Cladosporium cladosporoides e C. sphaerospermum, e as substâncias 3 e 5 15 Ecl.

No contexto de nossas pesquisas por novos agentes antifúngicos obtidos da flora brasileira, oito extratos e doze frações de Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, foram submetidos ao ensaio antifúngico pelo método de microdiluição, contra quatro espécies de fungos oportunistas, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis e Cryptococcus neoformans. Este trabalho revelou que os extratos e frações de P. nitens foram mais ativos contra C. krusei e C. parapsilosis quando comparados a C. neoformans, sendo que o crescimento de C. albicans foi moderadamente afetado por todos os extratos e frações. As atividades mais potentes foram observadas para as frações n-butanólica dos galhos (CIM = 15,6 µg/mL) e raízes (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL) contra C. krusei. Adicionalmente, a fração n-butanólica dos galhos foi submetida ao fracionamento cromatográfico, resultando no isolamento de quatro alcaloides guanidínicos, sendo N-1,N-2,N-3-tri- isopentenilguanidina (1), descrito pela primeira vez em espécies da família Fabaceae e nitensidinas A-C (2-4), os quais apresentaram atividade antifúngica moderada contra C. krusei (CIM = 62,5 µg/ mL) e C. parapsilosis (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL). Unitermos: Pterogyne nitens, alcaloides guanidínicos, antifúngico, fungos oportunistas, Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans. ABSTRACT: As part of our ongoing research on antifungal agents from Brazilian flora, eight extracts and twelve fractions from Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were screened for antimicrobial activity against four opportunistic fungi species (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans) using a broth microdilution method. The present investigation reveals that P. nitens extracts and fractions were more effective against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis than against C. neoformans. The growth of C. albicans was moderately affected by all tested extracts and fractions. The strongest effects were observed for n-butanol fractions from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/mL) and roots (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL) against C. krusei. Additionally, the chromatographic fractionation of the n-butanol fraction from branches afforded four guanidine alkaloids; N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine (1), described for the first time in the Fabaceae family, and nitensidines A-C (2-4), which showed moderate activity towards C. krusei (MIC = 62.5 µg/mL) and C. parapsilosis (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL).

INTRODUCTION The clinical relevance of opportunistic fungal infections have increased at an alarming rate in the second half of the twentyth century, including individuals infected with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer (Clark & Hajjeh, 2002; Hage et al., 2002). The most frequent causing agents of such infections are Candida, Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor and some unusual genera such as Fusarium, Trichosporon, 707 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(5): Out./Nov. 2010 Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi and Scedosporium (Guarro et al., 2006; Nucci & Anaissie, 2007). Furthermore, the most common treatment for these infectious diseases involves azoles and polyene macrolides, which are limited in their spectrum, and presenting severe side effects (Helmerhorst et al., 1999). For this reason, there is a need for new antifungal compounds which can serve as lead compounds for further development in antifungal chemotherapy. In this way, plants have been proven to be a rich source of antimicrobial agents (Vieira et al., 2005, Alves et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2006; Sena Filho et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007; Batista-Júnior et al., 2008; Cardoso-Lopes et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2008; Tempone et al., 2008; Bertucci et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2009a; Silva-Júnior et al., 2009). Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, is popularly named in South America as “tipa”, “yvi-raró”, “cocal”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” and “amendoim-bravo” according to the region where this plant grows. It is a sole beautiful legume tree from Pterogyne genus, which is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, reaching 5-12 m height (Burkart, 1952; Lorenzi, 1998). Cold aqueous preparations using stem barks has been used as folk medicine for treating of ascaridiasis (Crivos, 2007). Previous chemical and biological studies have demonstrated the presence of guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity against to human cancer cell lines (Bolzani et al., 1995; Ferreira et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2007, 2009b,c) and phenolics with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging activities (Fernandes et al., 2008; Regasini et al., 2008a,b,c; Souza et al., 2009; Souza et al., 2010). Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of extracts and fractions from branches, green fruits, roots and stem barks and isolated terpene guanidine alkaloids from P. nitens against four opportunistic human yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans), by using broth microdilution test. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material Roots, branches, green fruits and stem barks of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil) by Ph.D. Maria C. M. Young in January 2005 and identified by Ph.D. Inês Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP 204319b) was deposited at the State Herbarium \"Maria Eneida Kaufmann\" of Institute of Botany (São Paulo, Brazil). Extraction The powdered shade-dried plant material was extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane and, subsequently with ethanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation yielding a thick syrup. The crude ethanol extracts were further reconstituted in methanol-water (7:3) and then partitioned with ethyl acetate and n-butanol, successively. Samples from hexane and ethanol extracts, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and lyophilized hydroalcoholic fractions, were submitted to antimicrobial tests. Isolation of antifungal compounds 1-4 The n-butanol fraction (2.5 g) from the ethanol extract of branches was subjected to gel permeation column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol to afford nine fractions (B1-B9), which were combined after comparison of their TLC profile [chloroform:methanol (9:1)] revealed with Dragendorff´s reagent. The alkaloidal fraction (B2, 587 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase C-18 silica gel CC eluted with acetonitrile:water gradient that afforded eight fractions (ALK1-ALK8). Purification of fraction ALK5 (121 mg) by repeated CC over silica gel (230-400 mesh) eluted with chloroform:methanol in a gradient ranging from 0 to 35% methanol, furnished N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine (1, 7 mg) and nitensidine B (3, 12 mg). Fraction ALK-8 (88 mg) was subject to preparative TLC developed with ch loroform:methanol:triethylamine (87:12.5:0.5), developed three times to yield nitensidine A (2, 7 mg) and nitensidine C (4, 3 mg). The molecular structures of these guanidine alkaloids were identified through 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS data. The spectral data were in agreement with those published in the literature (Bolzani et al., 1995; Conegero et al., 2003). N N N H H N H H N NH N H N NH H N Me Me N NH 1 2 3 4 708 Rev. Bras.

Microorganisms and growth conditions The test organisms C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. krusei ATCC 6258, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and C. neoformans ATCC 90012 were originally obtained from the Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at São Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 to 48 h at room temperature. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing The antifungal activity tests were performed using broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications (Rodriguez- Tudela et al., 2003). The medium used was RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. Samples were diluted in DMSO and each well of a 96-well U-bottomed culture plate were added 100 µL culture together with 100 µL of 2-fold serial diluted test compound. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be 1 x 105 to 5 x 105 CFU/mL. This suspension was inoculated on the microdilution plate previously prepared with the extracts, fractions and compounds 1-4 diluted at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL. The plates were incubated with agitation at 37 °C for 24 h for Candida spp. and 48 h for C. neoformans. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were used as positive controls exhibiting a MIC value ranging from 2.00 to 0.06 and 64.00 to 2.00 µg/mL (Table 1). The MIC values were calculated as the lowest concentration of the test samples which shows complete growth inhibition of the fungi strains. Results were analyzed visually and spectrophotometrically. All assays were performed in triplicate. The extracts and fractions showing a MIC lower than 100, ranging from 100-500, 500-1000 and over 1000 µg/mL were considered potent, moderated, weak and not active, respectively (Holetz et al., 2002). Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) All tested samples in antifungal study showing MIC<1000 µg/mL, were transferred to plates of Sabouraud- dextrose agar. The plates were incubated at 35 oC for 48 h (yeast). The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that did not permit any visible fungal colony growth on the appropriate agar plate after the period of incubation. All assays were performed in triplicate. RESULTS In this work, eight extracts and twelve fractions as well as four guanidine alkaloids (1-4) were tested at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL against four human opportunistic yeasts (C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. neoformans). These results were summarized in Table 1. All extracts and fractions from Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were weakly active against the yeast C. albicans with MIC values ranging from 1000 to 250 µg/ mL, which were considered moderate to weak according to Holetz et al. (2002). The hexane extract from roots was not active to C. albicans and C. neoformans (MIC>1000 µg/mL). The extracts and fractions from roots and green fruits demonstrated moderate activity against C. krusei, except the n-butanol fraction from roots, which presented strong activity (MIC 31.2 µg/mL) against this yeast. Additionally, branches and stem barks exhibited potent activity against C. krusei with MIC values ranging from 15.6 to 62.5 µg/mL and the best result was observed for the n-butanol fraction from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/ mL). Furthermore the hexane extracts and hydroalcoholic fractions from branches and stem barks showed moderate to weak activity against this yeast. All the samples had weak to moderate activity against C. parapsilosis and C. neoformans, except for the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions from stem barks, which exhibited potent inhibition of C. parapsilosis (MIC = 62.5 µg/mL). Compounds 1-4 isolated from n-butanol fraction of branches from P. nitens inhibits the growth of opportunistic fungi with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.2 μg/ mL against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, respectively. Additionally, minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of all extracts, fractions and guanidine alkaloids (1-4) were also evaluated against the four yeasts and showed MFC values higher than 1000 µg/mL, indicating a fungistatic behavior. DISCUSSION Several Fabaceae species have been evaluated for their antifungal properties (Scorzoni et al., 2007) among them Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, a typical leguminous plant from Brazilian flora has been studied for antimicrobial activity. Previous biological studies have demonstrated that extracts from the barks of P. nitens did not show antibacterial activity (Salvat et al., 2001). The bioactivity presented for compounds 1-4 indicated that antifungal activity observed in the extracts and fractions may be at least partially due to guanidine alkaloids. It was also observed that the strongest antifungal effects of the tested samples were on strains of C. krusei and C. parapsilosis when compared with C. albicans and C. neoformans. P. nitens and isolated compounds displayed 709 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(5): Out./Nov. 2010 Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi activity against C. krusei, which is very significant because this yeast has natural resistance against commercial drug fluconazole (Rex et al., 1995), suggesting its potential application for treating C. krusei infections, considering a possible mode of action different from those azole drugs. The current study suggests that P. nitens have antimicrobial activity against opportunistic yeasts. Therefore, it could be an important source of antifungal compounds which can be useful for developing new lead compounds, including compound 1, which was described for the first time in the Fabaceae family. Further chemical and pharmacological investigations are thus needed in order to isolate and identify additional constituents and establish the potential mechanisms of action.

Additionally, three inactive neolignans, including the new bicycle[3.2.1]octane neolignan 2’-oxo-piperol B were obtained and characterized by spectrometric methods. Keywords: Nectandra grandiflora, Lauraceae, neolignan, flavonoid, radical scavenging activity, antioxidant Introduction Nectandra grandiflora Nees is a tree belonging to Lauraceae family, which is known for economically important species such as Aniba roseodora (“pau-rosa”), the main source of sesquiterpene (linalool)-rich essential oil used in perfumery; and species with scented leaves and bark such as Laurus nobilis (bay leaves) and Ocotea odorifera (Brazilian cinnamon), widely used as condiments.1-3 Lignans and neolignans are important classes of secondary metabolites occurring in Lauraceae species, which include several medicinally important closely related compounds as the anti-mitotic podophyllotoxin, extracted from Podophyllum peltatum (Berberidaceae), used in the preparation of the antitumoral lignans etoposide and teniposide, and the antioxidant nor- dihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), obtained from Larrea tridentata (Zygophyllaceae).4 Nectandra species are extensively used in folk medicine due to their antirrheumatic, digestive and diuretic properties.5 Some of the claimed medicinal properties have been substantiated by studies, e.g. on Nectandra salicifolia, which showed antifungal and vascular muscle relaxing properties,6 in addition to antimalarial activity due to the presence of the alkaloid costaricin in its bark extract.7 Previous work on N. grandiflora evidenced the presence of aporphine alkaloids and antitumoral activity in its bark extract.8 A number of pathologies are known to be ultimately associated with the imbalance of pro and antioxidant factors in living systems. Exogenous antioxidant compounds may therefore exert beneficial actions upon 527 A New Neolignan and Antioxidant Phenols from Nectandra grandiflora Vol. 16, No. 3B, 2005 systems which have been deprived from sufficient amounts of endogenous antioxidants as in some cardiovascular diseases, tumors, inflammation, ulcer and aging.9 As part of our ongoing projects aiming the phytochemical investigation of São Paulo State flora,10-12 the EtOH crude extract from leaves of N. grandiflora collected at Jureia State Park, Atlantic Forest, have been subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation using the β-carotene test on TLC for the detection of antioxidant compounds.13 Pure compounds isolated from this extract were further evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity towards the stable free radical DPPH and compared to standard compounds rutin and BHT.11,14 Non-active fractions were also investigated and afforded the benzofuran neolignan burchellin and two bicyclooctane[3.2.1] neolignans: piperol B and the new 2’-oxo-piperol B. Results and Discussion The EtOH crude extract of N. grandiflora leaves was successively partitioned with organic solvents affording hexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and MeOH extracts. The TLC test using β-carotene as revealing agent indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the EtOAc and MeOH fractions. Chromatographic fractionation of these extracts led to the isolation of protocatechuic acid (6) and flavonol glycosides afzelin (4) and quercetrin (5), which were identified through analyses of their MS and NMR spectra and comparison with literature data.15,16 Fractionation of the CHCl3 extract led to the isolation of neolignans 1-3. Compound 1 was obtained as a light brown viscous oil and its 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals for sp2 carbons and 9 signals for sp3 carbons, including three signals at ca. δ 56, assigned to three methoxy groups on sp2 carbons (Table 1). These data combined with HRMS analysis in the positive ion mode [(C21H24O5, (M+1)+• 357; expanded to C18H15O2.(OCH3)3] suggested compound 1 is a bicarbonyl neolignan, with 13C NMR signals for C=O groups at δ 190.5 and δ 203.0. The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed three broad doublets at δ 2.48, δ 5.08 and δ 5.14, and one multiplet at δ 5.89 assigned to hydrogens of an allyl moiety. Additionally, a doublet at δ 0.99 (3 H-9) and a quintuplet at δ 2.08 (H-8) indicated compound 1 is a guianin type bicyclooctane neolignan.17,18 The absence of a doublet at ca. δ 5.90 for an oxybenzylic hydrogen of the related benzofuran type neolignans, gave additional support to this proposal. Its relative stereochemistry was deduced from the absence of anisotropy from the aromatic ring on the deshielded H-9 (δ 0.99) evidencing a trans relationship between methyl group C-9 and the aromatic ring.17,18 Table 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. Moreover, the bicycle bridge associated with the guianin type configuration of 1 is evidenced by the absorption of H- 6’ at δ 5.72. Further analysis of NMR spectra and comparison with literature data for other guianin-type compounds suggested the presence of an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and an additional carbonyl (C-2’, ν 1760 cm-1) in the bicyclic moiety.17,18 HMQC correlations allowed the complete assignment of hydrogen signals to carbons; and HMBC correlations of C-2’ to H-7, H-3’ and H-7’; and C-4’ to H-7 and H-3’ supported the position of carbonyl groups at C-2’ and C-4’ in the bicyclic moiety, respectively (Figure 1). This spectrum also showed correlations of C-5’ to H-3’; C-7’ to H-6’; and C-1 to H-7, H-8 and H-3’, which supported the position of one methoxyl at C-5’, the allyl group at C-1’ and aromatic ring at C-7. Additional cross-peaks in the HMBC spectrum gave support to the proposed structure for compound 1 (Figure 1). ESI(+)-MS/MS experiments for the protonated molecule of m/z 357 with dissociation induced by collisions with argon provides further structural characterization as dissociation forms major ionic fragments of m/z 316 (24), 341 (8), and 301 (22) owing to the losses of an allyl, methyl and allyl plus methyl radicals, in addition to a fragment ion of m/z 151 (9), assigned to the dimethoxytropilium ion. Additionally, the protonated 1, of m/z 357, dissociates by the loss of a neutral molecule of 1,2-dimethoxybenzene to yield the ion of m/z 219 (Figure 2), which likely rearranges to form an acylium ion that subsequently loses a neutral C3H4 allene to yield an ion of m/z 179. Additional data from a LRMS experiment showed the base peak of m/z 179 and peaks at 357, 325, 316 and 219 (see Experimental section), which gave support to the structure proposed for compound 1. These data are fully consistent with the new bicyclooctane neolignan 1, which is therefore assigned as (7S*, 8R*, 1’R*, 3’R*)-3,4,5’-trimethoxy-3,7’-cyclo-8,1’-neolig-8’-ene- 2,4’(3’H)-dione. Compound 2 was identified as the bicycle [3.2.1]octane neolignan piperol B and compound 3, as the benzofuran neolignan burchellin, previously isolated from Piper betle and Aniba burchelli, respectively.19,20 Compound 2 is a guianin type and compound 3 is a porosin type neolignan and their identification was based on extensive analyses of NMR data as well as on comparison with literature data for guianin, porosin and ferrearin type neolignans, which are widely distributed in Lauraceae species.21 The antiradicalar activity of compounds 1-6 has been evaluated towards the stable free radical DPPH, which exhibits an absorption maximum at 517 nm, evidencing prominent activities of compounds 4-6 (Figure 3) and poor activities for compounds 1-3. The absence of phenolic hydroxyls in the latter renders them less effective in promoting DPPH reduction, therefore appearing as poor radical scavengers. The free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids and other phenols is mostly due to their aromatic hydroxy groups, which confer great stability to the phenolic radical as soon it is formed, after one hydrogen radical donation to DPPH. The stronger activity of compound 5 when compared to compounds 4 and 6 is probably due to the catechol moiety in the B ring of quercetrin along with its extended conjugation through the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system on the C ring, which are some of the major structural features associated with antioxidant activity of flavonoids.22 The comparison with standard compound rutin (∆A=81% at 50 µmol L-1) evidences the reported major roles of some structural Figure 3.

HPLC separations were performed on a Waters Prep LC 4000 System and C-18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns (4.6 mm and 20mm i.d. for analytical and preparative columns, respectively) and pre-columns were used. All solvents (Merck or Malinckrodt) were of analytical or HPLC grade. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. Low resolution ESI(+)-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. High resolution ESI(+)-MS analysis were performed on a hybrid double quadrupole (Qq) and orthogonal time-of-flight (Tof) mass spectrometer (Qtof, Micromass UK) operating at 7.000 resolution and mass accuracy of 10 ppm. The temperature of the nebulizer was 50 °C. The ESI and mass spectrometer were operated in the positive ion mode. The cone and extractor potential were set to 40 and 0 V, respectively. The m/z scan range was from 50 up to 1000. Tandem mass spectrometric [ESI(+)- MS/MS] experiments were performed using the product ion scan mode via Q1 mass selection of the desirable product ion, q2 collision-induced dissociation (CID) with N2, and orthogonal TOF mass analysis of the CID ionic fragments. The collision energy ranged from 15 to 25 eV, depending on the dissociation lability of the precursor ion. Plant material Nectandra grandiflora leaves were collected in Jureia- Itatins State Park, Atlantic Forest, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Ines Cordeiro. The voucher specimens (number: Moraes 05) were deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Botânica- SEMA, SP, Brazil. Extraction and isolation Dried and ground leaves (2.0 kg) were extracted with ethanol at r.t. and afforded a dark green EtOH extract (5.0 g) after solvent evaporation under vacuum. Partition of the EtOH extract with organic solvents gave the hexane (0.6g), CHCl3 (1.6 g), EtOAc (0.5 g) and hydroalcoholic (2.3 g) extracts after solvent evaporation. MPLC on silica gel of the CHCl3 extract (1.6 g, hexane/EtOAc gradient) gave 15 pooled fractions (A1-A15). Fraction A2 (41.0 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/acetone/HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound 2 (12.2 mg). Fraction A3 (32.1 mg), obtained from the elution with hexane/EtOAc 4:1, was further purified by preparative TLC (CHCl3/acetone/ HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound 1 (6.8 mg). Fraction A6 (88.1 mg) was recrystallized in MeOH to afford compound 3 (25.5 mg). CC on Sephadex LH-20 of the EtOAc fraction (200.0 mg) eluted with MeOH resulted in 42 subfractions which were pooled after TLC analysis (B1- B4). Fr. B2 (38.7 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/HOAc 79:18:2:1) and gave compound 4 (7.1 mg). Purification of fraction B3 (45.1 mg) by preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 36:12:1:1) afforded compound 5 (14.0 mg). The hydroalcoholic fraction (200.0 mg) was submitted to CC on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH resulting in 10 fractions (C1- C10). Purification of fraction C-8 (37.7 mg) by RP-HPLC (C18 Luna-Phenomenex column, MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 55:43:2, 8 mL min-1, detection at 280 nm) gave compound 6 (8.1 mg). Bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates Samples were eluted on TLC plates which were then dried and sprayed with 0.02% solution of β-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates are placed under natural light until discoloration of background. The remaining yellow spots indicate the presence of antioxidants.13 Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) The free radical scavenging capacities of the isolates and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated from their ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 µmol L-1 to 100 µmol L-1were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated as ∆A= (Ao-A)/Ao.11, 14 (7S*,8R*,1’R*,3’R*)-3,4,5’-trimethoxy-3,7’-cyclo- 8,1’-neolig-8’-ene-2,4’(3’H)-dione (1).

Cardoso, Dulce H. S. Silva, Ian Castro-Gamboa and Vanderlan da S. Bolzani* Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista CP 355, 14800-900 Araraquara-SP, Brazil Um novo biflavonol denominado chimarrosídeo (1) e oito flavonóis glicosilados adicionais (2-9) foram isolados das folhas de Chimarrhis turbinata. Suas estruturas foram elucidadas com base nos dados dos experimentos de RMN 1D e 2D, como: 3-O-rutinosilquercetina (2), 3-O- rutinosil-kaempferol (3), 3-O-galactopiranosil-(6→1)-ramnopiranosil kaempferol (4), 3-O-β- galactopiranosil-(6→1)-α-ramnopiranosil-quercetina (5), 6-hidroxirutina (6), 3-O- galactopiranosil-kaempferol (7), 3-O-glucopiranosil-kaempferol (8) e 3-O-ramnopiranosil- (6→1)-glucopiranosil-(4→1)-ramnopiranosil-kaempferol (9). Adicionalmente, a catequina (10) e a procianidina B-3 (catequina-(4α→8)-catequina) (11) também foram isoladas. O extrato bruto, frações e compostos isolados foram avaliados quanto às suas propriedades antioxidantes no teste em CCD aspergida com solução de β-caroteno, e teste espectrofotométrico utilizando o radical livre 1,1-difenil-2-picrilidrazila (DPPH). Os flavonóides 2, 5, 6, 10 e 11 apresentaram forte atividade antioxidante quando comparados com os padrões BHT e rutina. A new biflavonol, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonol glycosides (2-9), were isolated from the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata. Their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (4), quercetin-3-O- α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (5), 6-hydroxy-rutin (6), kaempferol-3- O-D-galactopyranoside (7), kaempferol-3-O-D-glucopyranoside (8) and kaempferol-3-O-α-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranoside (9). In addition, catechin (10) and catechin-(4α→8)-catechin-procyanidin B-3) (11) were isolated. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative properties using an autographic assay based on β-carotene bleaching on TLC plates, and spectrophotometric detection by reduction of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Flavonoids 2, 5, 6, 10 and 11 displayed strong free radical scavenging activity, when compared with the standards BHT and rutin. Keywords: Rubiaceae, chimarrhoside, DPPH, β-carotene Introduction In recent years, flavonoids have been widely recognized as a major class of secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties due to their ability to scavenge free radicals.1-3 Antioxidant is a broad classification for molecules that may act prior to, or during, a free radical chain reaction at initiation, propagation, termination, decomposition, or subsequent reaction of oxidation products as sensitive targets.4 There are several diseases, whose causes and severity are linked to oxidation, mainly those associated with oxygen free radicals, which have been implicated as mediators of degenerative and chronic deteriorative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases,5 such as rheumatoid arthritis,6 diabetes, vascular disease and hypertension, cancer and hyperplasic diseases,7 cataract formation and aging processes.8 Radical-mediated pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion, asthma and many others involving an imbalance in pro-oxidant- antioxidant processes.9 In our search for antioxidant compounds from Amazonian plant species, we examined constituents of Chimarrhis turbinata DC Rodr.. (Rubiaceae) leaves, collected in the city of Belém, Pará State, Brazil. The chemical composition of C. turbinata has been studied previously, and bioactive indole alkaloids were identified.10-12 In this paper, we describe the isolation 1354 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. of a new biflavonoid, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant effects, which were deduced by electrochemical detection coupled to an HPLC system, bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates, and parameters related to the evaluation of antioxidant activity measured by free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl). Results and Discussion Chimarrhoside (1) was obtained as an amorphous pale yellow powder from the EtOH extract and exhibited in its mass spectrum a molecular ion peak at m/z 1171 [M+H]+ obtained from ESIMS. The IR and UV spectra of 1 revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (270, 295, 344 nm, 1690 cm-1). Part of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of compound 1 were observed in duplicate, suggesting a dimer (Table 1). Comparison of the 13C NMR values of 1 with literature data13 evidenced the kaempferol aglycone and additional similar spectral features to those of 3, also isolated in this work, except for the duplication of some signals for carbons arising from a dimer structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 1, signals for two kaempferol units as two meta-coupled A-ring hydrogens (H-6/H-8) and two pairs of coupled B-ring hydrogens (H-3'/H-5' and H-2'/H-6') for each aglycone were observed, in addition to four anomeric hydrogens at δ 5.12 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 5.02 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 4.40 (1H, br s), 4.60 (1H, br s), 20 hydroxymethine and 2 hydroxymethylene hydrogens. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of two kaempferol moieties and 24 hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene signals which, analyzed together with 1H NMR data (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of two diglycoside moieties identified as rutinosyl and α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- (1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. This assumption was supported by signals at δ 103.1 / 67.1 and δ 104.0 / 65.9, assigned to C-1'’ C-6'’ of the glucopyranosyl and of the galactopyranosyl moiety respectively. Those signals also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’ (anomeric) and H-6'’ (Table 1); as well as signals at δ 100.9/16.4 and δ 100.4/16.6, assigned to C-1’’’/C-6’’’ of the two rhamnopyranosil moieties, respectively, which also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’’ (δ 4.4 0 and 4.60) and H-6’’’ (δ 1.17 and 1.11). On the basis of the above data, the chemical shifts assigned for each sugar: the glucosyl and galactosyl moieties were confirmed taking into account the values at δ 103.1, 76.6, 75.7, 74.3, 70.1 and 67.1 as well as δ 104.0, 73.9, 73.6, 71.5, 68.2 and 65.9 attributed to glucose and galactose, respectively.15 According to literature data, using the same solvent, the chemical shifts of hydroxymethines carbons in glucose are quite deshielded when compared to those of galactose. The glucosyl/galactosyl groups are linked to the rhamnosyl residue at C-6”, because the signal assigned to this carbon, in both sugar moieties, was markedly displaced downfield at δ 67.1/65.9 (∆δ +6), respectively when compared with the 13C NMR spectrum of free hydroxymethylenes in glucose/galactose. This also was confirmed by the observation of a HMBC long-range correlation of the anomeric hydrogen signal of the rhamnosyl group at δ 4.40 / 4.60 with C-6” of the glucosyl moieties at 67.1 and 65.9, respectively. Additionally, the site of glycosylation at C-3 of each kaempferol moiety was evidenced from downfield shifts of C-2 (∆δ +9) and C-4 (∆δ +2) and upfield shift of C-3 (∆δ -3) when compared to the aglycone,15 as well as from HMBC correlations of H-1'’ to C-3a/3b within each kaempferol diglycoside moiety (Figure 1). Further HMBC correlations of H-6 and H-8 with C-7 (δ 164.6) confirmed the assignments for ring A and suggested the interflavonoidic linkage at C-7 due to the observed downfield shift of its signal when compared to the monomer.15 Moreover, ESIMS analysis showed peaks of m/z 298 (70) and 133 (40) resulting from Retro Diels- Alder (RDA) fragmentations. From moiety A wherein bonds 1 and 3 undergo scission, lead to formation of ions I and II as well as scission of bonds 0 and 2 led to the formation of fragment m/z 433 (30). The fragment m/z 298 (70), was generated by both RDA suffered by moiety A and moiety B (Figure 2). Additional fragments observed in the mass spectra are in accordance with those reported for kaempferol.16 These data, combined with HPLC analysis, which showed a lower retention time for compound 1 (5.7 min) when compared to monomeric flavonol diglycosides 2 (9.8 min) and 3 (13.8 min.) (Figure 3), confirmed the proposed structure for compound 1 as kaempferol 3-O-β-rutinosyl-(7α→O→7β)-kaempferol-3- O-β-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. Further studies of the EtOAc extract from leaves of C. turbinata resulted in 10 known flavonoids already reported in the literature: Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol- 3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamno- Figure 1.

These compounds were identified and their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments and compared with literature data (Figure 4).13-15, 18, 19-22, 26-28 The radical scavenging effects obtained for compounds 2-11 assayed with DPPH are shown in (Table 2) using as reference the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 21.34 μg mL-1) and BHT (IC50 62.50 μg mL-1). These results indicate that the free-radical scavenging activity of these 1356 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. micromolecules is due to its hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the ease of stabilization of the phenoxyl radical after reduction of DPPH and is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by the IC50 values for compounds 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11.24 It is also evident from Table 2, that ortho-dihydroxy moiety plays more important role for this type of activity than the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, as the lack of the latter, e.g. in compound 10, contributed in a lesser extent to the loss of activity, as observed for compounds 3, 4 and 7-9, due to the missing catechol group.

Experimental General experimental procedures Commercial β-carotene (Aldrich) and DPPH (Aldrich) were used in the antioxidant assays. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C and referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance (CD3OD at δ 3.33 and 49.0 for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR-Nicolet, model EMACT-40 Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer, in the range 500-4000 cm-1. ESIMS spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10-20 eV with argon. Silica gel 60H (230-400 μ), (60-230 μ) (Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) and XAD-16 (Sigma) were used in column chromatography. TLC plates were illuminated under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. For preparative HPLC, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, ODS Phenomenex,, Luna column (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 μm), and pre-Column (50 x 10.00 mm) were used in this study. For semi-preparative HPLC, a Supelco ODS column 8 (250 mm x 10 mm x 5 μm) was used. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All EIMS spectra were obtained by direct insertion of the samples, using an electric cone potential of +70 eV. Plant material Leaves from C. turbinata DC Rodr. were collected at the Viro Reserve, in the State of Pará, in October 1996 and February 2000. Dr. Inês Cordeiro identified the specimen, and a voucher No. Cord-2367 was deposited in the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanic Garden, São Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation C. turbinata were collected twice, and the plant material obtained (1.0 kg), were dried, powdered and extracted with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) and EtOH, successively, affording extracts A and B, respectively, after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. Extract B was dissolved in MeOH:H2O (80:20) and partitioned with hexane. The hydroalcoholic fraction was partially evaporated to MeOH:H2O (60:40), and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. All fractions were preliminarily screened with β-carotene solution on TLC for antioxidant compounds. The EtOAc fraction (1.0 g after solvent evaporation) was dissolved in MeOH (5.0 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-1 to A-12. Fraction A-5 (160.0 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with MeOH and the obtained subfractions were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-5-I, A-5-II and A-5-III. Fraction A-5-II was purified by HPLC [Phenomenex ODS, 250 x 21.2 mm, 10 μm; eluent: MeOH-H2O (2:3, v/v); 12.0 mL min-1; UV detection at 280 nm] affording compounds 2 (7.0 mg), 3 (16.0 mg) and 4 (12.0 mg). Fraction A-6 (63.1 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over9 Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-6-I, A-6-II and A-6-III. Fraction A-6-I (25.0 mg) was purified by LC over polivinylpirrolidone (PVPP)25 eluted with MeOH affording the new compound 1 (2.6 mg). Leaves of C. turbinata (powdered and air-dried material 1.2 kg) obtained from the second collection were extracted exhaustively with EtOH at room temperature. The EtOH solutions were evaporated under vacuum to give a residue (57.1 g). This residue was dissolved in EtOH:H2O (90:10), and then extracted with n-hexane to give a n-hexane fraction (28.9 g). The EtOH:H2O fraction was extracted with CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH successively, to give a CH2Cl2 fraction (4.0 g), EtOAc fraction (4.1 g), n-BuOH fraction (12.4 g) and H2O-soluble residues (7.6 g), respectively, which were screened by β-carotene test on TLC.

Subfraction A-6-7-II (369.5 mg) was purified by preparative HPLC [ODS MeOH:H2O (18:82), 10.0 mL min-1, UV detection at 280 nm], affording 10 subfractions. Subfraction 8 was identified as compound 4 (80.0 mg). Subfraction 9 (10.0 mg) was purified by semipreparative HPLC [MeCN:H2O 20:80), 1.0 mL min-1, UV detection at 280 nm] to afford compound 7 (6.1 mg).

Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background was observed. The persisting yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.17 Determination of the radical scavenging activity 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was used in methanol (100 μmol L-1). 2. 0 mL of the reagent was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds, previously dissolved in methanol, with yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 and 5 μmol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and maintained for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin and BHT were used as standard compounds. DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in methanol (1.0 mL) served as control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer at 517 nm and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH treated control group.

Seven diketopiperazines, corresponding to the cyclos (L)-Pro-(L)-Phe, (L)-Pro-Gly, (L)-Pro- (L)-Pro, (L)-Pro-(L)-Val, (L)-4-OH-Pro-(L)-Leu, (L)-4-OH-Pro-(L)-Phe, and (L)-Pro-(L)-Leu, were isolated from the Aspergillus fumigatus fermentation broth. The relative and absolute stereochemistries were determined on the basis of NOESY experiments and by using a modified version of Marfey’s method using HPLC, respectively. Keywords: diketopiperazines, Aspergillus fumigatus, absolute stereochemistry Introduction The search for secondary metabolites from filamentous fungi has led to the discovery of many bioactive compounds.1 The structural novelty and diversity of fungal secondary metabolites make them a logical source of new leads for drug discovery and development. Among the 20 most commonly prescribed medications, six are from fungal origin.2 The versatility of microbial biosynthesis is conspicuous and the filamentous fungi, as well as the filamentous actinomycetes are the two most prolific groups capable of producing novel secondary metabolites.3 In the course of our screening program for antibiotic producers, we selected a Brazilian strain of Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from Pantanal (Mato Grosso do Sul State) soil sample. The interest in A. fumigatus metabolites is due to their broad range of biological activities.4 Moreover, Symoens et al.5 reported the high genetic polymorphism of A. fumigatus isolates, and according Debeaupuis et al.,6 the intraspecies variability at the genomic level appears to be very high, reflecting the environmental diversity of this species. Varga and Tóth7 described a general overview of the techniques used for the examination of the genetic variability of A. fumigatus and suggested that recombination played an important role in A. fumigatus populations. Different strains of the same fungus species may produce different compounds using the same medium.8 Also, the production of secondary metabolites by fungi may vary with the biotope in which they grow and to which they are adapted.9 Fumifungin and synerazol, new antifungal antibiotics, were isolated from the culture broth of A. fumigatus. Fumifungin was produced by a strain isolated from a Himalayan soil sample10 and synerazol was produced by a strain from Thailand soil sample.11 The study of a Brazilian strain of A. fumigatus, aiming to isolate and identify antimicrobial compounds, was undertaken based on the wide variability encountered for this species. Experimental Microorganisms Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from a soil sample collected in Pantanal – MS, Brazil and was identified by the “Fundação Tropical de Pesquisas e Tecnologia André Tosello”, Campinas– SP, Brazil. The microorganism is stored as a conidial suspension on silica gel (6 – 12 mesh, 1449 Diketopiperazines Produced by an Aspergillus fumigatus Brazilian Strain Vol. 16, No. 6B, 2005 grade 40, desiccant activated) at 4 °C. The Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 strains, used for antimicrobial evaluation, were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection. Metabolites production A two-step culture was performed for secondary metabolites production, consisting of an initial inoculum of a suspension of 4 x 106 conidia mL-1. The fungus was first grown at 40 °C in five Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of seed medium each.12 After 24 hours of the incubation on rotary shaker at 120 rpm, the resulting mycelia were harvested, rinsed and transferred to a 30 liter Micros I fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), containing 20 liters of fermentation medium (glycerol 1.5%, sucrose 1.5%, peptone 0.6%, yeast extract 0.15%, NaCl 3.0%, KH2PO4 0.06%, MgSO4. 7H2O 0.5%, CuSO4. 5H2O 0.0001%, FeSO4. 7H2O 0.0003% and dimethicone 0.01%). The initial pH value of the medium was set at 6.0, and the fermentation was carried out at 40 °C for 144 hours at 200 rpm in the first 24 hours. After that, the stirring speed was increased to 250, 280 and 300 rpm at 24, 48 and 72h, respectively. Then, the stirring speed was kept at 300 rpm for additional 72 hours, and aeration rate was maintained at 9 L min-1. Extraction and isolation of compounds The culture broth was separated from mycelium by filtration and submitted to three times partition with chloroform. The resulting chloroform fractions were combined and concentrated under vacuum to eliminate the organic solvent. Then, the crude chloroform extract (960 mg) was submitted to flash chromatography13 over 11 g of Si gel 60 (230-400 mesh), which was eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of methylene chloride-methanol 49:1. Thin- layer chromatography analysis of the 30 collected fractions allowed to assemble them into 19 fractions. Two active fractions (Fr-18 and Fr-19) were selected from guided bioassay, and further fractionated using an analytical HPLC system. Instrumentations consisted of a Shimadzu (SCL- 10Avp, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD- M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing. Analytical chromatography of the two active fractions, as well as of the unfermented medium extract was carried out using isocratic gradient (methanol-water 35:65). A CLC-ODS (M) – 4.6 x 250 mm Shimadzu column was used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. The spectral data from the detector were collected over the 200-400 nm range of the absorption spectrum. The Fr-18 (67.3 mg) yielded 1 (2.9 mg) and the Fr-19 (41 mg) afforded 2 (3.1 mg), 3 (1.4 mg), 4 (1.7 mg), 5 (3.2 mg), 6 (2.9 mg) and 7 (2.5 mg) after being purified by HPLC. Structure determination of compounds The structures of the compounds were determined by spectroscopic techniques, especially by detailed analyses of their 1H and 13C NMR spectra, including 2D NMR techniques (COSY, HMQC and HMBC), as well as mass spectrometry. The relative stereochemistries of the diketopiperazines were determined on the basis of the results of Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments. A modified version of Marfey’s method14 was used to determine the absolute stereochemistries of the individual diketopiperazines amino acids, which were obtained by acid hydrolysis. A small amount (100 mg) of each diketopiperazine was hydrolysed in 6 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid at 105 °C, under reflux, for 24 hours. The acid was removed under vacuum, and the acid-free mixture of amino acids was derivatized with the addition of 1-fluoro- 2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide (FDAA, Sigma). For that, 100 mg of the mixture of free amino acids were reacted with a solution of 1% FDAA in acetone (80 μL) followed by the addition of 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution (16 μL). Then, the resulting mixtures were kept at 40 °C for one hour. The molar ratio of FDAA to diketopiperazine was set at 2.8:1.0. HPLC was carried out using a reversed-phase column Nucleosil® 100-5 (4.6 mm x 250 mm ID) packed with 5 mm spherical silica (Macherey-Nagel). A linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)-MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)-MeCN (6:4), over 45 minutes (flow rate 1.0 mL min-1), was used to separate the FDAA derivatives, which were detected by UV at 340 nm. The L-amino acids (Aldrich Co.), used as chromato- graphic standards, were derivatized as described above, and the diketopiperazine individual amino acids were identified by co-injection with the standards ones. Bioassay The antimicrobial activity of the crude extract was investigated by using both agar diffusion, using Petri dish template system, and bioautography methods. For the first procedure, an aliquot of the extract, free of solvent, was dissolved (5.0 mg mL-1) in 50% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, v/v) aqueous solution and applied into the template holes on medium surface. Negative controls were run in parallel with DMSO aqueous solution and chloroform. Penicillin G (0.6075 U, 50 μL, Sigma) for Micrococcus luteus and penicillin G 1450 Furtado et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. (1.215 U, 50 μL, Sigma) for Staphylococcus aureus were used as positive controls. The inoculum was prepared by culturing each organism in antibiotic N° 1 agar medium (Merck) for 24 hours at 37 °C. The microorganisms were transferred to a 0.9% NaCl solution until they reached the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard. Each microorganism suspension (0.5%) was poured into antibiotic N° 1 agar medium, and distributed over the plates. For bioautography, the crude extract was dissolved (30 mg mL-1) in ethyl acetate, from which 8 μL were applied on silica gel G60 F254 thin layer chromatography plates. The chromatograms were developed in chloroform-methanol (93:7, v/v). After elution, the plates were carefully dried for complete removal of the solvents. Suspensions of micro- organisms were prepared in saline solution by comparison with the 0.5 McFarland standard. Afterwards, the suspensions were diluted (2%) in antibiotic N° 1 agar medium and distributed over the plates. Gentamicin discs were used as positive control. The thin layer chromatography plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humid chamber. Subsequently, the plates were overlaid with a solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.5%, m/v), and the growth inhibition was observed as clear zones on the chromatograms.15 The obtained fractions were evaluated by using bioautography technique, as described above, and the isolated compounds were evaluated in triplicate by microdilution broth method16, for which the compounds were solubilized in DMSO and diluted in tryptone soya broth in the range of 15 nmol L-1 to 2.9 mmol L-1. The inoculum was adjusted to each organism to achieve a cell Figure 1. Structures and NOESY correlations of the isolated compounds.

Penicillin G (Sigma) was used as positive control and the negative control was run for a solution of DMSO and tryptone soya broth. Also, it was included both inoculated wells, which controls the adequacy of the broth to support the growth of the organisms, and uninoculated wells, which was free of antimicrobial agent to verify the sterility of the medium. The microplates (96-well) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. After that, 40 μL of 2,3,5- triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.7%) in aqueous solution were added to indicate the viability of microorganisms.17 Results and Discussion The crude chloroform extract from A. fumigatus culture broth exhibited activity against Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, providing inhibition zones of 21 mm ± 0.577 and 25 mm ± 0.577, respectively, by using the agar diffusion method. The results of bioautography analysis displayed two large overlapping inhibition zones, at Rf values of 0.34 and 0.52. The chromatographic purification of chloroform extract, by using a combination of Si gel flash chroma- tography and high-performance liquid chromatography, furnished 7 diketopiperazines (Figure 1). The identification of diketopiperazines 1-7 was straightforward based on the presence of both the characteristic 13C NMR chemical shifts for the amide carbonyl groups (δ 167-172) and the 1H NMR signals of the amino acids. The presence of proline moiety as one of the components of 1-4 and 7 was deduced by the presence of methylene multiplets in the spectra (δ 1.15 – 3.59, 6H) and by H-C correlations observed in the HMBC experiments. Analysis of HMBC experiment showed the correlation of C-1 and C-6 with H-3 for compounds 1, 3, 6 and 7. Compounds 5 and 6 bear a hydroxyproline moiety [δH 4.45 (H-4), δC 69.0 (C-4) and δH 4.27 (H-4), δC 68.9 (C-4), respectively] instead of a proline one. Analysis of the NMR spectra indicated that phenylalanine, glycine, valine and leucine were the other amino acid moieties present in compounds 1-7 (Table 1, 2 and 3). Diketopiperazine 1 bears the molecular formula C14H16N2O2, which was established by mass spectrometry, using electrospray ionization (ESI). The molecular weight of compound 1 was deduced as 244 by the quasimolecular ions at m/z 245 [M + H]+, 267 [M + Na]+ and 283 [M + K]+. The molecular formula of diketopiperazine 6 was assigned as C14H16N2O3, which contains one additional oxygen in relation to compound 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. with theirs 1H and 13C NMR data. The 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 6 displayed signals of methylene benzylic protons groups (H-10) attached to monosubstituted benzene rings (δ 3.14- 3.18). These data suggested a phenylalanine moiety for these compounds. The 1H spectrum of the compound 2 showed the signals at δ 4.06 (J 2.0 and 16.9 Hz, dd, 1H, H-9a) and δ 3.69 (J 16.9 Hz, d, 1H, H-9b), both protons are attached to a carbon at δ 45.8, as observed in HMQC experiment, indicating a glycine moiety for this compound. The 1H spectrum of the compound 4 displayed two doublets at δ 0.93 (J 6.9 Hz, 3H, H-11) and δ 1.07 (J 6.9 Hz, 3H, H-12) indicating the presence of two methyl groups. Moreover, the signals at δ 2.48 (J 2.5 and 6.9 Hz, dsept, 1H, H-10) and δ 4.01-4.03 (m, 1H, H-9) allowed to propose a valine moiety for this compound. The molecular formula of diketopiperazine 5 contains one additional oxygen in relation to compound 7. Their 1H and 13C NMR signals showed close correspondence, except for the signals of both hydroxyproline and proline residues, respectively. Their 1H spectra showed two doublets at δ 0.95 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12) and δ 0.94 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12) for 5 and 7, respectively, as well as other two doublets at δ 0.96 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-13) and δ 0.95 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-13), indicating the presence of two methyl groups attached to the molecules. In addition, the signals at δ 4.13- 4.18 (m, 1H, H-9), δ 1.83- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-10a), δ 1.46- 1.53 (m, 1H, H-10b) and δ 1.83- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-11) of compound 5 and the signals at δ 4.09- 4.15 (m, 1H, H- 9), δ 1.81- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-10a), δ 1.47- 1.56 (m, 1H, H-10b) and δ 1.81- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-11) for compound 7 allowed to propose a leucine moiety for these compounds. The spectra data for all compounds showed signals due to one N-H proton (δ 4.56, br s, 1H), with exception of diketopiperazine 3. The EIMS data showed peaks at m/z 195 [M + H]+, 217 [M + Na]+ and 233 [M + K]+, which allowed to propose the structure of cyclo Pro-Pro for compound 3. 1H and 13C NMR previously reported data for the compounds 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are in agreement with obtained data for isolated diketopiperazines.18-20 Regarding the absolute stereochemistries of the diketopiperazines, it was possible to determine that all diketopiperazines were biosynthesized from L-amino acids (Table 4). All the derivatized obtained from the hydrolysis of the diketopiperazines displayed the same retention times of the derivatized standard L-amino acids. The modified Marfey’s method was successfully applied to the determi- nation of the absolute configuration of amino acids. It was done by using a linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)/ MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)/MeCN (6:4), over 45 minutes, (flow rate 1.0 mL min-1). The original method describes a linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethyl- ammonium phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.0)/MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylammonium phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.0)/MeCN (1:1), over 60 minutes (flow rate 2.0 mL min-1).14 Diketopiperazines corresponding to cyclic dipeptides have been isolated from microorganisms, sponges and from a variety of tissues and body fluids.18,21,22 These heterocyclic compounds display several biological properties, such as: antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral and plant growth regulation.19,23 Fdhila et al.20 reported the isolation of DD- diketopiperazines cyclo (D)-Pro-(D)-Phe, (D)-Pro-(D)-Leu, (D)-Pro-(D)-Val and (D)-4-OH-Pro-(D)-Phe from marine bacteria associated with cultures of Pecten maximus. These DD-diketopiperazines presented a potent inhibitory activity against the pathogen Vibrio anguillarum, while the LL-enantiomers were completely inactive.20 Therefore, the D-stereochemistry seems to be important for the biological activity.

This result is insignificant in comparison with penicillin, for which the MIC values were established at 0.25 ηmol L-1 and 0.12 ηmol L-1, respectively. It is important to point out that the literature reports24 the antimicrobial activity of the cycle (L)-Pro-(L)-Phe against a clinical isolated strain of Staphylococcus aureus at the concentration of 15 ηmol L-1 but, in the protocol used in this study, no activity was detected by using the mentioned concentration. The origin of diketopiperazines has been questioned, once several cyclic dipeptides have been found in fermentation broths and cultures of yeast, as well as in lichens and fungi.25 It is known that diketopiperazines can be generated via non-enzymatic cyclization of linear dipeptides at extremes of temperature.26 It was checked whether diketopiperazines would have been generated by heat sterilization and incubation of the medium culture during the fermentation process. However, these cyclic dipeptides were not detected in the HPLC profiles of the obtained extracts from the culture medium without the fungus. To our knowledge, these cyclic dipeptides have not been previously reported for A. fumigatus, with exception of the cyclo (L)-Pro-(L)-Leu. 27 Acknowledgments We are grateful to “Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP)” Brazil for financial support (proc. 99/09850-8), to Dr. Suraia Said for providing the strain of A. fumigatus, to Dr. Norberto P.
