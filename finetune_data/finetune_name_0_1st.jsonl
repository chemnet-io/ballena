Pupo 1 1 Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil 2 Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil Smallanthus sonchifolius is a traditional Andean plant which has been cultured mainly in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand due to its medicinal properties. A study of the endophytic fungi associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing 186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of Nigrospora sphaerica and Phoma betae liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3- methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential com- pounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-β-ol diterpene is being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including GC/MS, homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation. Keywords: Nigrospora sphaerica / Phoma betae / Yacon / Aphidicolin / Isocoumarin Received: March 19, 2008; accepted: June 30, 2008 DOI 10.1002/jobm.200800093 Introduction * The Asteraceae Smallanthus sonchifolius (Poepp. and Endl.) H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflamma- tory effects. Some unique substances like the anti- microbial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones [1–3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF2-9), but deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South America, New Zealand and Japan [4–7]. The plant is also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal colonization. Correspondence: Dr. Mônica T.

They may have qualitatively different rela- tionships with a single host plant, from parasitism to mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are con- sidered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages none of the partners, including the absence of external manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated fungi may produce substances with specific functions inside and outside the host plant in which they nor- mally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anti- cancer [9]. As part of the bioprospecting program in endophytic fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10–13], it was considered that S. sonchifolius, commonly named Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 Production of new cytotoxic agents 143 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.jbm-journal.com bioactive secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and biotechnological purposes. Using this approach, 32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds. Some of the compounds isolated in this research are being reported for the first time as secondary metabo- lites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant asso- ciations is discussed. Materials and methods Isolation, identification and preservation of fungal strains Yacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in Febru- ary 2006, in the city of Ribeirão Preto (S 21°11.933′ NO 47°46.699′), State of São Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Fac- ulty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirão Preto campus, University of São Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. The collected plant material was washed with run- ning tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were carried out by sequentially submerging the plant mate- rial in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were ex- cised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA me- dium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 μg/ml) and incubated initially at 30 °C for 48 h, followed by 72 h at 23 °C. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures. Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure cultures were obtained. Conidia producing strains were identified at the De- partment of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil. Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 °C in tubes contain- ing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers onto PDA slants at 4 °C. Cultivation and extraction procedures Two culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for cultivation and screening of biological activities of the isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures. Liquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1). First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incu- bated at 30 °C for 7 d. After this period, aqueous sus- pensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step, this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Büchner filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask con- taining 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This proce- dure was carried out for a small scale extract produc- tion for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cul- tures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH, followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro- Figure 1.

An Erlen- meyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek me- dium and treated in the same way for control purposes. For the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled wa- ter per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 °C for 40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation, one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about 2 × 2 cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incu- bation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 °C, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and the residual fraction (RS). Isolation of compounds EaS fraction (20.2 g) of Nigrospora sphaerica was fraction- ated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column (22.0 × 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents Figure 2.

Fraction 13 (30.1 mg) was identified as compound 1. Fraction M1EaS (3.1 g) was crystallized from a heated solution of MeOH/H2O 9:1 yielding compound 3 (101.0 mg; Fig. 2). Fraction EEaS (1.64 g) chromatographed over silica gel (400–200 mesh, 25.5 × 5.0 cm) and eluted with the same gradient as above mentioned (step C) produced 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (246.6 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230–80 mesh, 28.0 × 3.0 cm) and using a gradient from hexane: EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%; step D) to yield 9 fractions. Fraction 6 (46.3 mg) was rechromatographed again on silica gel (CC, 230– 80 mesh, 20.0 × 1.3 cm) using the same gradient elution (step E) to yield compound 2 (16.9 mg). N. sphaerica fraction EaL (474.3 mg) was fractionated over silica gel (CC, 400–200 mesh, 24.0 × 3.5 cm) by elution with gradient hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%) (step F) yielding 7 fractions. Fraction 7 crystal- lized spontaneously to afford compound 3 (98.0 mg). Fraction EaS (16.5 g) originated from 20 day cultures of Phoma betae (19 flasks) was chromatographed over silica gel (400–200 mesh, 11.0 × 12.0 cm) under gra- dient elution from hexane:EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step G; Fig. 3) to afford 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (686.7 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230–80 mesh, 25.0 × 4.0 cm) by using gradient elution from hexane:EtOAc (8:2) to MeOH (100%; step H) to Figure 3.

Compound 2 (14.7 mg) was precipi- tated from fraction 5 (99.7 mg) using CHCl3 (step I). Fraction EaS (888.2 mg) originated from 32 day cultures of P. betae (1 flask, fungus sporulation time) was chromatographed over silica gel (400–200 mesh, 27.0 × 3.0 cm) using gradient elution with hexane: EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step J, Fig. 3) to provide 13 fractions (Pb-1 to 13). Fraction 4 (Pb-4, 21.9 mg) was submitted to HPLC using an isocratic solvent system containing hexane:EtOAc (9:1) delivered to the a semi- prep Nucleosil 100–7 column (250 × 10 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min–1, and monitored at 254 nm detection wavelength at 25 °C (step K). Compound 4 (12.1 mg) was collected at 41 min. The residual fraction (5.0 mg) collected at 45 min was resubmitted to HPLC employing a prep C18 Shimadzu column (250 × 20 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min–1, using MeOH as elu- ent, and monitored at 254 nm (step L). Compound 5 (0.6 mg) was collected at 28 min. Fraction 13 (Pb-13, 426.8 mg) was chromatographed over sephadex LH-20 column (60.0 × 2.5 cm) using EtOH as eluent (step M) to afford 7 fractions.

Spectroscopic and chromatographic equipment 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (CDCl3, acetone-d6 or MeOH-d4) on Bruker spectrometers (DRX-400 or DRX- 500), working at 400 or 500 MHz for 1H, and at 100 or 125 MHz for 13C. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference. Mass spectra were performed in a high-resolution eletrospray Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (HR/ESI/MS) or in a Shimadzu GC/EI/MS OP2010 employing an AOC-20i auto-injector and a DBS- MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column. The high per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system con- sisted of a Shimadzu LC-6AD pump, and a SPD-20A UV- vis detector with a CBM-20A interface. Data acquisition was carried out on LC Solution software version 1.1. Tumor cell cultures and cytotoxic bioassay Human tumor cell lines MDA-MB435 (breast), HCT-8 (colon), SF295 (brain) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leuke- mia) were obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bo- vine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and strepto- mycin). Cultures were maintained in a humidified in- cubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cytotoxic effect was assessed using the MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability described by Mosmann [16] according to an established protocol [17]. Briefly, tumor cells were placed in 96-well plates at the following densities: 0.7 × 105 (HCT-8), 0.6 × 105 (SF295), 0.3 × 106 (HL-60) and 0.1 × 106 (MDA-MB435) cells/ml. Extracts and fractions were tested in a single concentration (100 μg/ml) and pure substances in a range between 0.048 and 25 μg/ml during 72 h. Control groups received the same amount of vehicle and doxorubicin (Doxolem®, Zodiac Produtos Farmacêuticos S/A, Brazil), which was used as a positive control. Growth inhibition rates were quantified as the percentage of control absorbance by the reduced dye at 550 nm in accordance with the following equation: Inhibition rate = [(OD control well – OD treated well) × (OD control well)–1] × 100 . Each sample was tested in two independent experi- ments performed in triplicates. The results consisted of the average value for each experimental unit. The IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were ob- tained by non linear regression using the GraphPad Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). An activity scale was utilized to appraise the cytotoxic potential of the tested samples: inactive sam- ples (I), samples with low activity (LA, cell growth inhi- bition between 1–50%), moderated activity (MA, cell growth inhibition between 50–75%), and high activity (HA, cell growth inhibition between 75–100%). Results and discussion Isolation and identification of fungal strains Altogether 32 species of fungi were isolated and labeled using the plant name initial letters and a number, for example, SS29 (Table 1).

Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization and five other species occurred simultaneously in two tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42, SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots. Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture conditions employed. They remain unidentified and were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated were identified by traditional taxonomical methods based on morphological features as established in Table 1. The isolated genera Drechslera, Fusarium, Phoma, Alter- naria, Curvularia, Nigrospora, Glomerella and Aspergilus have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a range of hosts [18–20]. They also have proven to be endophytes in several plant species [21–26] strengthen- ing the argument that disease is an exception in the plant-microbe interaction, which could be more prop- erly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis [27]. Genus Papulaspora is a well-known competitive soil mold in the culture of mushrooms [28, 29] and it has just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few species as Vitex negundo [24], Manilkara bidentata [30], Taxus chinensis [31], Amomum siamense [32] and Solanum tuberosum [25]. Preussia, however, is recognized either as a soil or a coprophilous genus [33, 34] but has never been mentioned before as an endophyte. Cytotoxic activity of extracts From the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL and RS were practically inactive (data not shown). The exceptions were RLSS33, RLSS75 and RLSS84, which Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 Production of new cytotoxic agents 147 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetate fractions from both culture types of P. immersa (SS13), N. sphaerica (SS67) and A. tenuissima (SS77) produced good results on all tested cells indicating that production of bioactive molecules by these fungi does not depend on the culture medium employed. These observations emphasize the significance of these species in future biotechnology studies. Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance of isolated compounds N. sphaerica (SS67) and P. betae (SS84) were chosen for large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive com- pounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts. Three substances were isolated from the N. sphaerica EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound 1 was identified as pimara-7,15-dien-3β-ol, compound 2 as ergosterol per- oxide and compound 3 as aphidicolin. Spectral data of compound 2 were in agreement with literature data [35], while compound 1, recently detected in a plant essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36]. This is the first report of compound 1 obtained from a fungal source and having its structure completely elu- cidated by 1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds 1 and 2 showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested (Table 3). Compound 3, isolated from the EaL fraction of N. sphaerica (SS67) had its structure established as the diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR data that are in agreement with reported data [37]. Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity 148 M. B. C. Gallo et al. Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Aphidicolin also may damage a fragile site of the mammalian genome [38, 39]. How- ever, it is a valuable tool to study eukaryotic DNA syn- thesis and cell cycles. P. betae (SS84) EaL fraction actually showed maximal efficacy against all the three cancer cell lines and was Table 3.

In liquid potato- sucrose medium, P. betae is reported to produce an as- sortment of bioactive diterpenes [40, 41], including ap- hidicolin (3), an specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resul- tant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1H NMR techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only compound 2 was isolated corroborating the initial low activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day cultures yielded compound 6, which was identified as dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines tested. The subfraction 1H NMR spectrum revealed a mixture of two substances in a 1:1 ratio, later separated and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3- one (compound 4) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl- isocoumarin (compound 5) in accordance with literature data (Fig. 4) [43, 44]. When compounds 4 and 5 were tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities, respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound 4 against other tumor cell lines had been previously described [45, 46] but the results in this report suggest that isocoumarin (compound 5) and ergosteroid (com- pound 4) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating or improving either the therapeutic effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs [47, 48] or radiotherapy [49]. Our results suggest that compounds 4 and 5 might be considered as hits for drug development of a novel anti- cancer combination therapy. The amounts of pesticides employed in S. sonchifolius cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes P. betae and N. sphaerica and their host have similar biosynthetic path- ways [52, 53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). N. spha- erica is also known to cause both reduction of spore ger- mination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic fungi, i.e, Fusarium oxysporum [55, 56], one of the isolated endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore, maintenance of N. sphaerica and P. betae as endophytes seems to be an ecological benefit to S. sonchifolius.

The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artiﬁcial diet at 1 mg g−1 and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superﬁcial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g−1. Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic S. densiﬂora extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from V. polygama were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, ﬂavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition. 2006 Society of Chemical Industry Keywords: Tarum˜a; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; Vitex polygama; Siphoneugena densiﬂora; Spodoptera frugiperda; botanical insecticide; pest control 1 INTRODUCTION With a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efﬁcacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3 Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noc- tuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important ﬁeld crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by con- suming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4 Of the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, Vitex polygama Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5–9 This plant is commonly called ‘Maria-Preta’, ‘Tarum˜a’, ‘Congonha-cinco-folhas’ and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, Siphoneugena densiﬂora Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in S˜ao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named ‘Uvatinga’,13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack. ∗Correspondence to: Margareth BC Gallo, Departamento de Qu´ımica, Universidade Federal de S ˜ao Carlos (UFSCar), CP 676, 13565-905, S ˜ao Carlos-SP, Brazil E-mail: marejor@uol.com.br †This paper was given in part at the XX Brazilian Congress of Entomology, Gramado-RS-Brazil, 5-10 September 2004, Abstract EN-335, p. 341.

Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 General Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, J 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethanol) from Aldrich Chemi- cal Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck- Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei M¨unchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low- resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple- quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectropho- tometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pel- lets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Aus- tralia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 × 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70–230 or 230–400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), SephadexLH-20 (25–100 µm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7(Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled. 2.2 Plants Vitex polygama and Siphoneugena densiﬂora were collected in July 2000, in the city of Po¸cos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, Brazil, respectively. 2.3 Extraction and isolation The powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after ﬁltration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 ◦C. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 × 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting ﬁltrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1. Compounds 1 to 43 were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (1, 9, 14 to 18, 25, 26 and 43; see Fig. 1) are described below.

Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with methanol. A total of 23 fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven fractions (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase methanol, ﬂowrate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield compound 1 (ﬁrst peak, 5.5 mg) and substances 7 and 8, identiﬁed as a mixture, (second peak, 3.1 mg), after three cycles of 54 min. 2.3.5 Isolation of compounds 9 to 11 from Vitex polygama (VP-EMT layer) A quantity of 1.9 g and 900 mg of VP-EMT layer (Table 1) were submitted to column chromatogra- phy (3.0 × 46.0 cm) using SephadexLH-20 and methanol as eluent. A total of 23 fractions of 50 mL were collected. Similar fractions were combined, yield- ing seven fractions (EMT1 to EMT7). Fraction 3 (EMT3, 551.0 mg) was rechromatographed over sil- ica gel (230–400 mesh) using gradient elution from ethyl acetate + dichloromethane (9 + 1 by volume) to methanol; 60 fractions of 50 mL were obtained and combined into 17 fractions (EMT3a to EMT3r). Frac- tion 5 (EMT3e, 140.5 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative TLC on silica gel 60 F254 with double development, using dichloromethane + acetone (1 + 1 by volume) as mobile phase and UV detection, yielding com- pounds 9 (77.7 mg), 10 (11.0 mg) and 11 (14.3 mg) respectively. 2.4 Insect rearing Larvae of S. frugipereda used in the experiments were obtained from cultures at the Departamento de Entomologia, Fitopatologia e Zoologia Agr´ıcola of the Escola Superior de Agronomia Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo (ESALQ/USP), and maintained in environmental chambers at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod. The artiﬁcial diet used for the bioassay and previously described22 contained cooked ‘carioca’ bean 37.5 g, 1076 Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) DOI: 10.1002/ps Natural products active against S. frugiperda wheat germ 30.0 g, soy meal 15.0 g, casein 15.0 g, yeast extract 18.75 g, tetracycline 56.5 mg, agar 11.5 g, Vanderzant vitamin mixture for insects 4.5 mL, ascorbic acid 1.8 g, sorbic acid 0.9 g, methyl p- hydroxybenzoate 1.5 g, formaldehyde (40% v/v) 1.8 mL and distilled water 600 mL, in a total volume of 720 mL. 2.5 Toxicity bioassays by ingestion against Spodoptera frugiperda 2.5.1 Crude extracts and layers A quantity of 100 mg of crude extracts or fractions was diluted in a small volume of acetone (e.g. 2 mL) along with ascorbic acid (ingredient of the artiﬁcial diet). The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg g−1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 × 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 ◦C), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot’s formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 × 6.0 cm) containing ﬁlter paper at the bottom (4.0 × 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10–20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence. The control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls. 2.5.2 Isolated compounds Four well plates (24 × 1.5 mL wells) were ﬁlled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar ﬂow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 µL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artiﬁcial congealed diet. The ﬁnal concentration was about 0.1 mg g−1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar S. frugiperda larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbott’s formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound. 2.6 Statistical analysis Data consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment means were established by Tukey’s test.24 Results are given in the text as probability values, with P < 0.05 adopted as the criterion of signiﬁcance. Complete statistical analysis was performed by means of the SAS program.25 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Structure elucidation Substances 1 to 43 were identiﬁed by comparison of their NMR, MS, UV and IR spectroscopic data with data previously reported in the literature.

S. densiﬂora polar extracts (SD-ML, SD-HAL, SD- MS, SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, SD- HAR) were responsible for the highest mortalities (100%), followed by VP-HAL (60%), VP-HF (90%) and VP-HAF (100%) extracts from Vitex polygama, taking into account the treatment period (Table 2). They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid–liquid partition. Partition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD- AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2). The VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of Vitex madiensis caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in S. frugiperda.30 Ecdysteroids 9 to 12 (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract. Flavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufﬁcient amounts to be bioassayed. The ﬂavonoids quercetin (25) and quercitrin (26) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (25) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450- dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione S-transferases from S. frugiperda.35 In addition, quercitrin (26), a ﬂavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not signiﬁcantly different (P < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound 17, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity. 3.3 Developmental effects In general, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP- HL and VP-HF, which showed signiﬁcantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage. Compound 9, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statis- tically signiﬁcant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (P < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmen- tal stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result. Although the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds 14 and 43 (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins 15 and 17 were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea- Bulla et al.,38 gallic acid (13), the compound isolated from several extracts of S. densiﬂora and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound 14, signiﬁcantly reduces larval growth of S. frugiperda at 1 mg g−1. 4 CONCLUSIONS Polar extracts from S. densiﬂora and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efﬁcient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of S. frugiperda. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin 14 along with the insecticidal effects of ﬂavonoids 25 and 26 might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound 14 might be acting synergistically with 43, and in concert with daucosterol (19), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid 13 and other Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) 1079 DOI: 10.1002/ps MBC Gallo et al. compound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.

Abstract-Five amides were isolated from the roots of Ottonia corcouadensis. Two are the known piperlonguminine and piperovatine. The other three are new and their structures are: (2Z,4Z)-N-isobutyl-5-(3,4_methylenedioxyphenyl)- penta-2,4-dienoic amide for isopiperlonguminine; (2E,4E)-N-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methylenedioxy- phenyl)-penta-2,4-dienoic amide for corcovadine; and (22,4Z)-N-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)~penta-2,4-dienoic amide for isocorcovadine. INTRODUCTION Ottonia corcovadensis Miq., a herbaceous shrub of the Piperaceae, is known in Brazilian folk medicine under the name of ‘false jaborandi’.* Its roots and, to a lesser extent, the stems are chewed to alleviate toothache, due to their anesthetic action on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Extraction of the roots with petrol followed by extensive column chromatography yielded five amides. Piperlonguminine (1) and piperovatine (5) were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples. Piperovatine is the sole substance responsible for the anesthetic activity and was obtained pure by crystallization in a system of solvents at low temperature. The remaining three amides are new, having been named isopiperlonguminine (2), corcovadine (3) and isocorcovadine (4). Piperlonguminine-isopiperlongu- minine and corcovadine-isocorcovadine are shown to be pairs of cis-tram isomers. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The work was performed with two batches of roots of 0. corcouadensis collected at the same site with a 1 year interval. Different extraction procedures were applied to the two batches. In the first process the ground roots were extracted exhaustively with petrol at room temperature; the resulting oily extract was fractionated on a column of silica gel and fractions eluted with solvents of increasing polarity. Piperlonguminine (1) and corcovadine (3) were isolated in this way. With the second batch, extraction was done in a Soxhlet, the extract being chromatographed repeatedly on a series of silica gel columns. By this procedure, all five amides could be isolated. Separation on silica gel proved to be effective, although extremely delicate due to the closeness of the bands. All five amides were eluted with hexane-EtOAc mixtures of composition close to 7:3, thus calling for frequent rechromatography of *Not to be confused with the genuine jaborandi, comprising several Pilocarpus species (family Rutaccae), the source of pilocarpine and other alkaloids. = CH-CH =CH-CONHCH,CHMe, 1 tram-2-tram-4 2 cis-2-cis-4 CH = CH-CH = CHCONHCH,CMe,OR 3 tram-2-truns-4, R = AC 4 cis-2-cis-4, R = AC 6 trans-2-truns-4, R = H -5 :I CH,CH = CH-CH = CHCONHCH,CHMe, Me0 5 the fractions. Most difficult to isolate pure was piperovatine (5). Its presence was monitored through the procedure by means of its anesthetizing action on the tongue. Several attempts to purify the active fractions were unsuccessful due mainly to their pronounced tendency to darken. The final purification was achieved again through chromatography on a silica gel column and elution with mixtures of hexane and EtOAc. At the end, the compound crystallized after being kept for 11 weeks at - 5”. The pair piperlonguminine-isopiperlonguminine Piperlonguminine (I), the isobutylamide of trans,trans- piperic acid, was originally isolated from the roots ofPiper longum [l 1. Isopiperlonguminine (2), C,,H,,O,N, 1305 1306 S. S. COSTA and W. B. MORS crystals, mp l&143”, is herewith described as the corresponding cis,cis isomer. The mass spectra of the compounds are identical; IR and UV spectra are similar. The IR spectra differ notably at 985 cm-‘, where only 1 shows a strong absorption peak due to the tram configuration. Comparison of the UV spectra shows essentially a hypsochromic shift of the main absorption band, of the order of 10 nm. Significant differences appear in the ‘H NMR spectra, where signals in the region of the olefinic protons appear much less complex for 2 than for 1 (see Table 1). The positions of the signals agree with those reported for synthetic cis,cis-piperic acid [2] and for cis,cis- piperine (chavicine) [3]. Doubts about the precise assignments for protons B and C [3] could be dispelled with the aid of the ‘spin tickling’ technique of double resonance. Irradiating the proton corresponding to the most upfield signal (HA, d 5.69, d, J = 11 Hz) determines splitting of the signal at d 6.85 (t, J = 11 Hz), which must therefore be assigned to Ha. Conversely, irradiation of the most downfield signal (presumably the deshielded H,, (6 7.45, t, J = 11 Hz) determines splitting of two signals, as would have to be expected, one being due to H, (already identified) and the other one H, (S 4.66, d, J = 11 Hz). The observed differences between the spectra of the isomers with respect to the protons fl to the amide carbonyl group are consistent in that the uniform shielding in the trarqtrans structures suffers a deshielding effect in the cis,cis structures. The pair corcovadine-isocorcovadine Corcovadine (3), C,,H,,O,N, crystals, mp 141-144”, exhibits the typical UV absorptions of a piperic acid derivative (see Experimental). The IR spectrum is similar to that of piperlonguminine with respect to the amide function (v,,, 3225 and 1640 cm- I), the trans configura- tion of the olefinic double bonds (lOOOcm_ ‘) and the methylenedioxy group (925 cm - ‘). A second carbonyl function is revealed by a strong absorption at 1710 cm - I, which can be attributed to the presence of an acetoxy group. The ‘H NMR spectrum also very much resembles that of piperlonguminine with respect to the piperic acid moiety (see Table 1). In addition, there are signals for geminal methyl groups (6H, s) at S 1.46; methylene protons (2H, d, J = 6Hz) at 5 3.59, coupled with the proton at the nitrogen (1 H, br.), at 6 6.23. A single signal (3H, s) at 62.02 is again indicative of an acetoxy group, which was also confirmed by the mass spectrum: with a fragmentation pattern similar to that of piperlongu- minine, it shows an additional significant peak at m/z 271 (M + - 60; 14 y’,), corresponding to the loss of one acetic acid molecule from the molecular ion. Other fragments were typical of amides derived from piperic acid. On the basis of these data, structure 3 was assigned to corcovadine. Chemical confirmation was obtained through alkaline hydrolysis, producing the amide 6, with a tertiary hydroxyl group, and piperic acid. Spectral comparisons analogous to those discussed for piperlonguminine and isopiperlonguminine allowed for correlation of corcovadine (3) with its isomer, isocorcovadine (4), C,,H, ,05N, crystals, mp 80-85”. The absence, in the IR spectrum of the latter, of an absorption in the region of 970-990cm -’ points to the absence of double bonds in a trans configuration. The cis configuration receives support from similarities in the UV and ‘H NMR spectra to those of isopiperlonguminine (2) (see Table 1 and Experimental). Mass spectral fragmentations of 3 and 4 are identical. EXPERIMENTAL Mps were determined on a Kofler hot stage and are uncorr. UV spectra were obtained in MeOH and IR spectra in KBr unless otherwise stated. ‘HNMR spectra were measured at 100MHz and MS at 70eV. Column chromatography was performed on Si gel, and TLC on Si gel H and GF,,, (Merck). The identity of compounds, whenever stated, was established by direct comparison with authentic samples through mp, mmp, UV, IR, ‘HNMR and MS, as well as TLC. Plant material. Two batches of 0. corcovadensis were collected at the hillside of the Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, in December, at a 1 year interval.

The dried, powdered roots (1600g) were exhaustively extracted by maceration with petrol. The combined extracts (22 1.) were coned under red. pres. to give a dark green viscous mass (7.7Og). The material was treated with Me,CO and the soluble portion was again evapd to dryness under red. pres. The dark oily residue (5.86g) was cbromatographed on a Si gel column (350g) and developed with solvent mixtures of increasing polarity. Toluene-EtOAc (19: 1) eluted piperlongumine (1, 36 mg). Elution with toluene-EtOAc 9:l and 4:l afforded fractions which were combined and submitted to the same procedure. Repeated chromatography followed by five recrystallizations from MeOH yielded corcovadine (3, 58mg). Although these last fractions were strongly anesthetizing to the tongue, separation of the active material could not be achieved. Extraction and separation II. The dried, powdered roots (19OOg) were extracted with petrol in a Soxhlet until the extract was clear (72 hr.) The filtered extract was coned under red. pres., yielding a dark green viscous oil (22g). The material was chromatographed on a column of Si gel (300g) and developed first with hexane, followed by solvent mixtures of increasing polarity, through toluene, EtOAc and MeOH. This procedure resulted in the separation of four crude fractions, of which only one, the one eluted with EtOAc, showed anesthetic activity. The fractions were repeatedly rechromatographed, monitoring the procedure by means of TLC. In this, visualization of all the compounds in UV light was very helpful: the tram compounds showed intense, blue fluorescence, while the cis compounds were detached from the background as dark spots. Eventually, all five amides were separated in this way. Solvents for crystallization were: toluene for piperlonguminine; hexane-EtOAc (2:l) for isopiperlonguminine; MeOH for corcovadine; hexane-EtOAc (4:l) for isocorcovadine; MeOH for piperovatine. All were obtained as colourless crystals. Piperionguminine (1). Mp 167-169” (lit. [l ] 166-168”). IR v,,,cm-‘: 3280, 1640,1615,1550, 1495, 1470, 1430,1360,1240, 1185, 1030, 985, 920, 850.

VIEIRA* and ISAO KUBO Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natural Resources, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. (Received in revised form 12 August 1989) Key Word Index--G&pea bracteata; Rutaceae; stems; quinoline alkaloids; plant growth inhibitor; molluscicidal activity. Abstract-Four quinoline alkaloids were isolated from stems of Gnlipea bracteata. In addition to one new compound, 2-(3’,4’-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)-quinoline, three were identified as the known compounds 2+propylquinoline, 2- n-pentylquinoline and 2-(l’-pentenyl)-quinoline. However, this is the first report of their isolation from a natural source. All alkaloids showed an inhibitory effect on shoot and root growth of lettuce (Lactuca satiua). Three of them also showed molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis. INTRODUCTION The Rutaceae is represented by a great number of species in tropical areas. Many of these species have never been the target of a phytochemical investigation. In our con- tinuing effort to find biologically active compounds we have investigated G&pea bracteata. In this paper we report the isolation and identification of one new alkaloid and three known ones from G. bracteata collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The growth inhibitory effect against lettuce of the alkaloids, as well as, their molluscicidal activity are also described. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The dichloromethane extract of the stems of G. bracteata afforded four alkaloids 14. The combination of various routine ‘H, 13C NMR and mass spectrometric analyses allowed us to attribute the formulas C,,H,,N. C,,H,,N. C,,H,,N and C,,H,,NO, to compounds 14, respect- ively. ‘H NMR (Table 1) showed signals of six aromatic protons for all compounds at 67.24 f0.04, d, J= 8.5 Hz, H-3; 68.02kO.02 d, J=8.5 Hz, H-4; 67.74kO.02, dd, .I =7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-5; 67.47+0.04, td, J=7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-6; S7.66kO.04, td, J=7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-7 and 68.01 +O.Ol, d, .I = 7.8, H-8. An exception was the signal corresponding to H-3 of compound 3 at 67.51. The similarities of the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the four compounds suggest that a 2-substituted quinoline system is the structural basis for all compounds, and that the difference between them is the type of substituent attached to C-2. Compound 1 possesses a n-propyl moiety characterized by the signals in the ‘HNMR at 62.91 (t), 61.81 (sext, J * Permanent address: Departamento de Quimica, Universi- dade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, CEP 13560, Brazil. = 7.4 Hz), 60.91 (t), integrating 2: 2: 3, respectively. Con- firmation of this unit can be taken from the 13CNMR signals at 641.30,23.25 and 13.99, which can be attributed to C-l’, C-2’ and C-3’, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are very closely related to each other and to compound 1. The mass spectra showed the parent peak at m/z 199 and 197 for 2 and 3 respectively, indicating that the difference between 2 and 3 is two hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the ‘H NMR of both com- pounds showed that 2 has two more signals in the olefinic region C66.80 (td) and 66.70 (d)] than 3 and revealed the presence of a trans-substituted double bond in 3. The signal of four aliphatic protons at 61.30 (m) for 2 was observed, which corresponds to two methylene carbons. The 13CNMR for compounds 2 and 3 showed 14 signals. For 2 there were five signals at high field indi- cating a n-pentyl moiety. However, for 3 there were only three signals in this region. These data indicate that 2 has a n-pentyl chain attached to C-2 and that 3 has the corresponding pentenyl chain. Compound 4 is related to the three compounds de- scribed above. Analysis of its ‘H and 13CNMR spectra reveals that, in addition to the quinoline ring, there is another aromatic ring present in the molecule. The tri- substituted nature of this ring is confirmed by the signals 66.72 (d, 5=1.2 Hz), 66.69 (d, J=7.8 Hz), 66.65 (dd, J 1 R=\\;f\\ 3 813 814 P. C. WEIRA and I.

The presence of a piperonyl moiety is once more confirmed by the mass spectrum which show- ed a peak at m/z 135. The parent peak of m/z 217 requires a methylenedioxyphenylethyl as the substituent of this quinoline. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. The compounds 2- methyl (5) and 2-aminoquinoline (6) were used as models c121. The alkaloids isolated showed inhibitory effects on the growth of lettuce seedlings and molluscicidal activity as determined according to the methods described pre- viously [3,4]. All compounds at concentrations larger than 500ppm inhibited both shoot and root growth in the lettuce test. At lower concentrations their activities were diminished. When the concentration was decreased to 100 ppm, only compounds 3 and 4 showed activity but at this concentration. 1 and 2 had no activity. Molluscicidal activity was exhibited by compounds 2-4. Compound 1 was not molluscicidal even at 100 ppm. Compound 4 had the most powerful molluscicidal activ- ity killing snails at a concentration of only 5 ppm. Com- pounds 2 and 3 possessed activities at 20 and 10 ppm, respectively. Our results suggest that the presence of a second aromatic ring at C-2 increases the activity of the com- pounds, and that the activity of 2-alkylquinolines de- pends on the length of the alkyl chain. It is important to note that very few examples of naturally occurring alka- loids have been found to exhibit molluscicidal activity [S]. although recently, some potent molluscicidal alka- loids were isolated from members of the Meliaceae [S]. It is also important to mention that few species of the genus Gu/ipeu have been studied. However, in a unique example presented by Mester [7], the alkaloids isolated were 7- substituted quinolines. We suspect that there should be a tendency for this genus to produce this class of com- pound. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of constituents. Galipea hracteata was collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil; a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Institute de Biociencias. USP, Sao Paulo. Dried stems (920 g) were extd with CH,CI, at room temp. for 4 days. The ext was evapd to dryness yielding (5.567 g) ofcrude extract. A portion of this ext (1.463 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (50 g) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH,CI,, EtOAc and MeOH). Alkaloids were found in frs 16.-35. They were then sepd by low pressure chromatography on silica gel (Lichroprep) using hexane-EtOAc (49: l), affording I (31 mg), 2 (IOmg). 3 (15 mg) and 4 (I 13 mg).

Introduction Styracaceae is a family constituted of small trees and shrubs, mostly native to tropical and subtropical regions (Pio Correa, 1931). The genus Styrax is dierent from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat in¯ammatory dis- eases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styr- acaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985; Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988; Anil, 1980; Segal et al., 1967, 1964; Ulubelen et al., 1978; Kawai and Sugimota, 1940; Kitagawa et al., 1974; Ulubelen, 1976; Nakano et al., 1967). From the leaves of Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (4) and the known nor-lig- nans 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methyl- enedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1), 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7- methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2), 5- [300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (3) and the lignan di- hydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (5), together with urso- lic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds 1±2 showed inhibitory proper- ties against the microorganisms, Candida albicans, Clado- sporium cladosporioides and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elu- cidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and 2). 2. Results and discussion The dried and powdered leaves of Styrax ferrugineus were extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2ÐCH3OH (2:1 v/v).

The bioactive extract was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with n-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc (4300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by puri®cation on preparative HPLC aorded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (4) and the known nor-lignans (1) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (2) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and (3) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (5) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identi®ed by chromato- graphic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The tri- terpenes and sterols were identi®ed by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13C NMR spectral data for 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylene- dioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) and 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7-methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13C NMR spectral data for 1 and 2 are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC corre- lations are presented in Fig. 1. Compound 2 was obtained earlier from the seeds of S. ocinalis (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent puri®cation of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of S. camporum (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucida- tion of compound (4) as well as the antimicrobial activ- ities of all lignoids isolated. Compound 4 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The molecular formula C26H32O10 was deduced from ES-MS m/z [M+Na]+ 527, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data.

The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Tables 1 and 2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 4 with those described for 2 indi- cated that 4 is a glucoside derivative of compound 2. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 displayed four doublets at 6.77 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at 7.44 (1H, dd, J=1.9; 8.0 Hz) attri- butable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at 7.17 (1H, s) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, s), two triplets due to methylene protons at 2.75 (2H, t, J=7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, t, J=7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at 1.86 (2H, dt, J=7.8 Hz). This 1H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of com- pound 2. Further analysis of the 1H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet at 4.11 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and several signals at 4.33±3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound 4. The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 2) suggested the presence of a nor-lignan with similar ske- leton to 2. The main dierence observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 4 was due to the presence of the signals at 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH2) which con®rmed a glucosyl moiety. The 1H±±1H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. 1H±13C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. 1H±13C-three-bond (HMBC) correla- tions from the H-100 protons resonances at 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at 107.64 and 112.12 identi®ed the later as C-4. The 3J HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-30 and C-40 quaternary carbons with H-20 and H-60 proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-tri- substituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound 4. Other signi®cant correlations for con®rmation of 4 are depicted in Fig. 1. The extract and compounds isolated from S. ferrugi- neus were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively. Compounds 1±2 exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus C. sphaer- ospermum could be predictive for the activity against C. albicans. In conclusion, the activities of compounds 1±5 may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infec- tions in several Brazilian regions. 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin±Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for 1H and 50 MHz for 13C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90 and 135, respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70±230 and 230±400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H2SO4 after heating. 3.2. Plant material Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart.

Bioassay The crude extract and puri®ed lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium S. aureus ATCC 12228, the fungus C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast C. albicans ICB 12. Stock solu- tions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure com- pounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appro- priate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on pre- coated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as posi- tive and negative controls, respectively. For the anti- fungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened cham- ber at 27C. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with C. albicans and S. aureus were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of C. albicans and S. aureus in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30C for 24 h. 3.4. Extraction Dried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of Styrax ferrugi- neus Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2±CH3OH (2:1, v/v) at room tempera- ture. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH±H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. After removal of the sol- vent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respec- tively. The CHCl3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel ¯ash (77.9 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gra- dient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5- (300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)benzofuran (1), and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(300 -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40 -dimethoxy- phenyl)benzofuran (2). Fr. 40±41 (39.4 mg) was fractio- nated by micron silica gel ¯ash CC (Merck) using CH2Cl2±CH3OH (95:5) as eluent to aord 11 Frs. Frs. 5±9 gave a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52±55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica ¯ash CC (11.6 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using Hex±EtoAc±CH3OH (6:2:2) as eluent to aord 20 Frs. Frs 6±12 furnished dihydrodehydiconiferyl alcohol (5) (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gradient yielded 22 Frs. Fr. 20 (13.8 mg) gave a mixture of 3+4, which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-18 column) using a mixture of CH3OH± H2O (4:6) as eluent to aord compounds 3 (4.0 mg) and 4 (5.8 mg). 3.4.1. 5-(300-Hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) White amorphous powder; IR max (KBr) 3432, 2926, 1606, 1476, 1232, 1148, 1037, 931 cmÿ 1; ES-MS [M+Na]+ m/z 349, ES-MS [M+K]+ m/z 365.

Hydrolysis of 4. A solution containing glucoside 4 (2.0 mg) in 3 M HCl (5 ml) was heated until re¯ux began, this being maintained for 4 h. The reaction mix- ture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 1% NaOH and extracted with CHCl3 (310 ml). The reaction mixture was puri®ed on CC silica gel using CH2Cl2±CH3OH (99:1) as eluent to obtain 2 (1.0 mg) which showed the same Rf [0.5 CH2Cl2±CH3OH (98:2)], IR and 1H of authentic 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-meth- oxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Identi®- cation of the glucose obtained as a product of the reaction was con®rmed after reaction of the aqueous fraction with an enzymatic kit based on glucose oxidase, this being speci®c for glucose and yielding a positive response (Trinder, 1969). 600 P.M.

Keywords: Piper hispidum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihy- dropyridone and piperidine moieties have been isolated from Piperaceae species (Parmar, 1997). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insec- ticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of Piper hispidum H.B.K. (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). In this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elu- cidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)-heptadienamide (1), 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one (2) and also of eight known antifungal amides N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3), piper- amine (4), N-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 -pyridin-2-one (5), piplartine (6), piperine (7), a,b- dihydropiperine (8), 5,6-dihydropiperlonguminine (9) and pellitorine (10). The amides isolated from stems of Piper hispidum (1, 3 and 4) and from seeds of Piper tubercu- latum (2, 5±10) were active against the fungus Clados- porium sphaerospermun as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). 2. Results and discussion A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of P. his- pidum was subjected to silica gel column chromato- graphy, followed by HPLC puri®cation to aord the compounds 1, 3 and 4. Compound 1, has a molecular formula C18H23NO3 as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of the 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cmÿ 1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.91 (2H, s), and four ole®nic protons which showed signals at 5.45 (1H, d, J3,4=12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, dd, J4,3 and 4,5=12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, dd, J5,4 and 5,6=12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, dt, J6,5 and 6,7=12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,-unsaturated carbonyl system.

The assignments of these ole®nic protons were con®rmed by analysis of the 1H±1H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylenic protons H-8 at 2.62 (2H, t, J8,7=7.0 Hz) and H-7 at 2.46 (2H, m) were con®rmed by the DQ- COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 ( 5.94, 1H) could be also observed. The presence of a isobutyl moiety was con®rmed by the signals at 3.13 (2H, dd, J100,200=7.0 Hz), 1.80 (1H, m) and 0.92 (6H, d, J300,200 and 400,200=7.0 Hz) attributed to H-100, H-200, H-300 and H-400, respectively. The coupling between H-100 and the NH hydrogen was con®rmed by 622 H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of 1 are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-®eld region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 166.5, ten ole®nic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; ArauÂ jo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of 1 was determined as (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8- (30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide. A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of P. tuberculatum was fractionated by column chromato- graphy on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to aord compounds 2 and 5±10. Compound 2, was shown to have a molecular formula C17H19NO5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of 13C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cmÿ 1 (asymmetric C±O±C stretching). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 revealed the presence of meth- oxyphenyl groups by the signals at 3.84 (6H, s), 3.85 (3H, s), one aromatic proton signal at 6.76 (2H, s) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four ole®nic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at 6.48 assigned to H-8 (J8,9=12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at 6.71 assigned to H-9 (J9,8=12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the Z con®guration. The attribution of this con®guration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the Z isomer when compared with the E isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at 6.89 (J4,3 and 4,5=9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at 3.97 (J6,5=7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-®eld region of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four ole®nic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at 165.7 and 168.1.

H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 623 of the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at 6.48 (H-8) and 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at 165.7 was assigned to C- 2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-®eld region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide 2 was de®ned as 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one. N- (12, 13, 14- Trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 - pyridin -2- one (5), a,b- dihydropiperine (8) and 5,6- dihydropiperlonguminine (9) have the molecular for- mula C17H21NO5, C17H21NO3 and C16H21NO3, respec- tively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), Piper guineense (Par- mar et al., 1997) and P. tuberculatum (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the ®rst time. N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)- propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3) was previously isolated from Piper peepuloides (Shah et al., 1986) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piperamine (4) was previously obtained from Piper nigrum (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piplartine (6) was pre- viously described from Piper aborescens (Duh et al., 1990) and P. tuberculatum (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (7) was previously described from P. aborescens and P. tuberculatum (ArauÂ jo-JuÂ nior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (10) had been reported from Cissampelos glaberrina (Rosario et al., 1996). The antifungal activity of amides 1±10 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds 1±10 are shown in Table 3 and were per- formed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of C. sphaerospermum growth at that level were considered inactive. The minimum quantity of compounds 1±4, 6, 8±10 necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for 7 and 5 the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively. The values for 7 and 5 were comparable to those observed for the reference compounds miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). P. hispidum and P. tuberculatum have accumulated amides with cis geometry in their side chain, which is a structural feature quite rare in nature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1986). 3.

Antifungal assay The microorganism used in the antifungal assay C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de BotaÃ nica, SaÄ o PauloÐSP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay Ð 10 ml of solutions corresponding to 100 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermun in glucose and salt solution (Rahali- son et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25C. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the mini- mal amount of 1±10 required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 mg) and miconazole (0.5 mg) were used as positive controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents The dried and powdered stems of P. hispidum (28.0 g) were extracted with CH2Cl2 (3150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 1 (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 3 (0.004 g). Frs containing 4 were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of P. tuberculatum (24.3 g) were extracted CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromato- graphic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:- EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 2 (0.024 g) and 6 (0.003 g). Fraction 20 (0.146 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 5 (0.005 g). Fraction 19 (0.083 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions] to yield 7 (0.012 g) and 8 (0.007 g). Frs. 8 and 13 yielded 10 (0.079 g) and 9 (0.018 g), respectively. 3.5.

Introduction As part of our continuous investigation into the chemi- cal composition of Brazilian Neoraputia (Engler) Emmer- ich species, we recently reported the isolation of eight polymethoxylated ¯avones and one ¯avanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich (Arruda et al., 1991, 1993), four polymethoxylated ¯avones, 20-hydroxy-3,4,40,5,60-pen- tamethoxychalcone (1) and 20-hydroxy-3,4,40,5-tetra- methoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (2) from N. magni®ca var. magni®ca (Engler) Emmerich (Passa- dor et al., 1997). The isolation of these interesting new chalcones combined with our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae stimulated an investigation of other organs of N. magni®ca var. magni®ca. Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan Trypano- soma cruzi, is estimated to aect some 16±18 million people,mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organization). Control of the insect vector (Triotoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimina- tion of transmission by insect bites, and, as a con- sequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the dis- ease. Besides low ecacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side eects (Souza et al., 1998). The bloodstream form of the parasite T. cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production (Souza et al., 1998). This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined (Souza et al., 1998). GAPDH catalyses the 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results and discussion The hexane extract of the ripe fruits of N. magni®ca var. magni®ca, aorded g-tocopherol and three chal- cones. One was characterised as 20-hydroxy-3,4,40,5-tet- ramethoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (2) by comparison with both published data and an authentic sample (Passador et al., 1997). Placement of the chro- mene ring between C-50 and O-60 in 2 was determined on the basis of the following data. The 1H NMR spec- trum (Table 1) showed features of a chromene ring ( 6.60 and 5.47 vinylic protons, and a singlet at 1.50, 6H, assigned to a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups) and signals for four methoxy groups. The assignment of one singlet to H-2 and H-6 ( 6.86, 2H) suggested that three methoxy groups are attached to the B-ring. From a biosynthetic point of view, the remain- ing methoxy group could be attached to C-40 or C-60 of the A-ring. The spectrum also revealed a singlet at 14.24 corresponding to one chelated hydroxyl, thus attached to C-20. Furthermore, a singlet at 6.07 (1H) clearly indicated the A-ring to be 20,40,50,60- or 20,30,40,60- tetrasubstituted. From the HMBC experiments (Table 2) the observed correlations between the hydroxyl pro- ton at 14.24 and the 13C signals at 105.9 (J3), 167.9 Table 1 1H NMR chemical shifts for chalcones 1±4 H 1 2 3 4 30 6.2 d (2.4) 6.07 s 6.06 s 6.07 s 50 5.97 d (2.4) 2 6.84 s 6.86 s 7.56 d (8.6) 7.16 d (2.0) 3 6.93 d (8.6) 5 6.93 d (8.6) 6.90 d (8.3) 6 6.84 s 6.86 s 7.56 d (8.6) 7.20 dd (2.0, 8.3) b 7.71 d (16) 7.72 d (16) 7.77 d (15.5) 7.76 d (15.5) a 7.80 d (16) 8.05 d (16) 8.02 d (15.5) 8.03 d (15.5) 100 6.60 d (12) 6.58 d (9.8) 6.60 d (9.9) 200 5.47 d (12) 5.45 d (9.8) 5.47 d (9.9) 400/500 1.50 s 1.55 s 1.56 s OMe 3.84 s 3.87 s 3.86 s 3.86 s OMe 3.90 s 3.90 s 3.86 s 3.93 s OMe 3.91 s 3.90 s 3.94 s OMe 3.92 s 3.91 s OMe 3.92 s OH 14.31 s 14.24 s 14.31 s 14.34 s 644 D.M. Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 (J2) and 92.5 (J3) led to their assignments as C-10, C-20 and C-30, respectively, thus indicating that the unsub- stituted carbon must be vicinal to C-20. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 3) showed a signal for only one meth- oxy group attached to the ortho-disubstituted carbon ( 63.1) which was assigned to the 4-OMe functionality. This implies that the methoxy group in the A-ring is located at C-40 ( 55.9), and therefore established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-50 and O- 60. Moreover, the existence of any correlation between the 1H signal at 6.07, assigned to H-30 (by HSQC and HMBC), and the 13C signal at 102.9 (C-50), con®rmed the position of the chromene ring between C-50 and O- 60. The mass spectrum and elemental analysis data for 2 are reported here for the ®rst time (see also Scheme 1 and Section 3). Chalcone (3) exhibited similar NMR spectra to that of 2 (Tables 1 and 3). In addition to signals described for the A-ring of 2, the 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a 1,4-disubstituted phenyl moiety ( 7.56 d, J=8.6 Hz, H-2 and H-6; 6.93 d, J=8.6 Hz, H-3 and H-5). The presence of a fragment ion at m/z 161 (Scheme 1) in the mass spectrum for 3, associated with cleavage between the A-ring and C-b0, clearly indicated the pre- sence of one methoxy group in the B-ring. The signal of H-2/H-6 ( 7.56) showed a one-bond correlation (by HSQC) with the 13C signal at 130.0, and a long-range correlation (by HMBC, Table 2) with the 13C signal at Table 3 13C NMR chemical shifts for chalcones 1±4 and ¯avones 5±8a C 1 2 3 4 C 5 6 7 8 1 131.2 130.8 128.4 128.0 2 160.5 160.7 160.8 160.2 2 105.7 105.3 130.0 109.4 3 108.9 107.8 107.5 108.7 3 153.5 153.4 114.5 153.4 4 177.5 177.1 177.1 176.6 4 141.0 139.5 161.1 149.0 5 161.0 152.6 152.6 161.3 5 153.5 153.4 114.5 111.1 6 96.2 140.4 140.4 96.8 6 105.7 105.3 130.0 123.3 7 164.1 157.7 157.7 164.4 10 105.8 105.9 106.4 106.3 8 92.9 96.2 96.2 93.7 20 168.5 167.9 167.5 167.4 9 159.9 154.4 154.4 160.1 30 93.9 92.5 92.7 92.7 10 109.3 112.9 112.9 109.7 40 166.3 161.3 161.4 161.2 10 126.8 126.0 125.6 126.0 50 91.5 102.9 103.1 102.9 20 103.5 100.4 106.1 106.6 60 162.5 156.0 155.7 155.6 30 153.6 149.5 148.4 148.9 b 142.4 142.3 142.3 142.6 40 140.9 138.1 150.3 150.6 a 127.0 126.5 125.2 125.2 50 153.6 143.8 108.7 108.9 b0 192.4 192.4 192.8 192.4 60 103.5 106.6 121.0 121.3 100 116.9 116.8 116.8 OMe 55.8 56.3 56.3 55.9 200 124.2 124.5 124.4 OMe 56.4 56.9 61.6 56.2 300 77.7 77.9 77.8 OMe 56.4 61.5 62.2 400/500 28.1 28.0 27.9 OMe 56.4 62.2 OMe 55.6 55.9 55.4 55.8 OMe 61.0 OMe 55.8 55.9 55.8 56.1 OCH2O 102.2 101.9 102.5 OMe 55.8 55.9 56.1 OMe 56.2 63.1 OMe 61.0 a Assignments based on HSQC/HMBC for 1±4 and 6. 13C±1H COSY and long range 13C±1H COSY for 5 and HSQC for 8.

Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 645 161.1 (J3), thus indicating the methoxy group to be located at C-4 and permitting the assignment of the signal at 161.1 to C-4. HSQC experiments also showed correlations of the signal of H-3/H-5 ( 6.93) with the 13C signal at 114.5. In addition, the signal of H-a ( 8.02) showed cross peaks with the 13C signal at 128.4, indicating this signal to C-1. For 2, placement of the chromene ring was apparent from the J3 couplings observed between the hydroxyl proton (20-OH) and the 13C signal for C-30, indicating that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-20. HMBC experiments with 3 did not detect any correla- tions of the hydroxyl signal with the A-ring carbons. However, the 13C NMR spectrum of 3 (Table 3) revealed resonances for C-10 to C-60 and C-100 to C-500 in close agreement with the resonances for the corre- sponding carbons in 2. A singlet at 6.06 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the 13C signal at 92.7, permitting the assignment of these signals to H-30 and C-30, respectively, when compared with 2. The 13C NMR spectrum of 3 did not show any signal for meth- oxy groups attached to the ortho-disubstituted carbon (ca 63); they were observed at 55.4 and 55.8. This implies that the methoxy in the A-ring was located at C- 40 and established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-50 and O-60. The signals at 55.4 and 55.8 were then assigned to 40-OMe and/or 4-OMe. Based on the above evidence, the correlations from H-30 to the 13C signals of C-50 ( 103.1) and C-10 ( 106.4) were consistent with the angular structure for 3. The new natural product is, therefore, 20-hydroxy-4,40-dime- thoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (3). Chalcone (4) also showed spectral characteristics of a 20-hydroxy-40-methoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chal- cone (Tables 1 and 3). HMBC experiments (Table 2) with 4 also did not detect a relationship between the 20- OH signal at 14.34 to the A-ring carbons. However, the chemical shifts of the A-ring and chromene carbons were comparable with those for 2 and 3 (Table 3). As discussed above, the signals of the methoxy groups at 55.8 and 56.1 (6H) supported the chromene ring to be between C-50 and O-60. This was also con®rmed by the HMBC experiments, which showed correlations of the H-30 signal ( 6.07) with the resonances of C-20 ( 167.4) and C-10 ( 106.3). The mass spectrum of 4 gave signi®cant fragments for m/z 191 and 233 (Scheme 1) requiring the presence of two methoxy groups in the B-ring. This was supported by the 1H NMR spectrum which showed signals for three methoxy groups ( 3.94, 3H, s; 3.93, 3H, s; 3.86, 3H, s) and for three protons giving rise to an AB spin system ( 7.16, d, J=2.0 Hz, H-2; 6.90, d, J=8.3 Hz, H-5; 7.20, dd, J=2.0 and 8.3 Hz, H-6). From the HMBC experiments (Table 2), the observed correlation Scheme 1.

Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 between the b-proton at 7.76 and the 13C signals at 109.4 (J3) and 123.3 (J3) led to their assignments as C-2 and C-6, respectively. The spectrum also showed a cor- relation of H-6 at 7.20 with the 13C signal at 149.0 (J3), con®rming a methoxy group at C-4 and showing that this signal can be attributed to C-4. The existence of a correlation between the 1H signal at 7.16, assigned to H-2, and the 13C signal at 153.4 determined the position of the other methoxy group at C-3 and per- mitted the assignment of this signal to C-3. The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 20- hydroxy-3,4,40-trimethoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano) chalcone (4). It has been noted that the H-b and C-b of a chalcone are more deshielded than the H-a and C-a resonances (Agrawal, 1989). Both are aected by changes in the B- ring substitution and C-a also by the presence or absence of a 20- or 60-oxysubstituent. HSQC experiments of 1±4 showed correlations of 1H signals at ca 8.0 and 7.7 to the 13C signals at ca 126 and 142, respectively, indi- cating apparent anomalies. The methine proton at ca 7.7 showed cross peaks with the C-2 and C-6 signals (Table 2), so permitting the assignment of the up®eld signal at ca 7.7 to H-b. The anisotropic eect of the 50,O-60-chromene substituent on the H-a caused a down®eld shift above the usual range for 20,60-oxysub- stituted chalcones, this resulting in the H-a proton being more deshielded than H-b. The dichloromethane extract of fruits on successive chromatographic separation aorded the ®ve ¯avonoids, 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avanone (Passador et al., 1997), 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avone (5) (Passador et al., 1997), 30,40-methylenedioxy-50,5,6,7-tetramethoxy¯avone (6) (Arruda et al., 1993), 30,40-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-tri- methoxy¯avone (7), and 30,40-methylenedioxy-5,7-di- methoxy¯avone (8). The latter appears to be new. Compound 6 has been isolated from Ageratum cony- zoides (Vyas and Mulchandani, 1986) and N. alba (Arruda et al., 1993); however, its 13C NMR data are reported here for the ®rst time (Table 4). The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 6, permitted the assign- ments of all carbons (Tables 2 and 3). A singlet at 6.55 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C signal at 107.8, and a long-range correlation with the 13C signals at 126.0 (J3), 160.7 (J2), 177.1 (J2) and 112.9 (J3) permitting their assignments as H-3, C-3, C-10, C-2, C-4 and C-10, respectively. Two doublets at 7.06 and 7.07 were coupled to each other and showed a long- range correlation with the C-2 and C-10 signals, thus indicating these two hydrogens were attached to C-20 and C-60. The 1H NMR spectrum revealed a signal for three methoxy groups at 3.98 (6H) and 3.99 (3H); however, in HSQC ( 62.2, 56.9, 56.3) and HMBC experiments these signals appeared as a broad singlet. The observed correlations between the methoxy protons at 3.98/or 3.99 and the 13C signal at 143.8 (J3), which showed cross peaks with the 1H signal at 7.07, led to their assignments as 50-OMe, C-50 and H-60. The signal at 7.06 was then assigned to H-20. HSQC experiments permitted the assignments of 13C signal at 100.4, 106.6 and 56.3/or 56.9 to C-20, C-60 and 50-OMe, respectively. HMBC experiments also con®rmed the B-ring to have a methylenedioxy group between C-30 and C-40 by the cross peaks with the 1H signal of OCH2O at 6.08 with the 13C signals at 149.5 and 138.1, which showed cor- relations with H-20 and the latter ( 138.1) with H-60. The signals at 149.5 and 138.1 were then assigned to C-30 and C-40, respectively. The 13C signal at 102.2 could be attributed to OCH2O by HSQC. The 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for two meth- oxy groups at 61.5 and 62.2. Thus implies that the methoxy groups in the A-ring are located at C-5, C-6 and C-7, since the 1H signal at 6.78 (1H) for the unsub- stituted methine indicated that this proton must not be vicinal to CO (C-4). Thus, the observed one-bond correlation between the signal of H-8 ( 6.78) and the 13C signal at 96.2 led to the assignment of C-8 to this resonance. The methoxy protons at 3.92 showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C signal at 61.5, and a long-range correlation with the 13C signal at 140.4 (J3), suggesting the assignment of the latter signal to C-6 or C-5. The presence of a correlation between the signal of H-8 and the 13C signal at 140.4 (J3) clearly indicated this signal to be at C-6. The signal for C-7 was estab- lished as 157.7 by the existence of a correlation Table 4 Eect of compound 5, mixture of 6+7 and 2+4 on TcGAPDH acti- vitya Compound Concentration (mg/ml) Absorbance Speci®c activity (U/mg) % Inhibitory activity 5 30 0.345 24.65 46 50 0.136 9.72 80 100 0.009 0.64 99 Control 30 0.641 45.80 50 0.670 47.87 100 0.560 40.01 6+7 25 0.343 20.24 54 35 0.249 14.69 68 100 0.000 00.00 100 Control 25 0.751 44.31 35 0.773 45.61 100 0.688 40.59 2+4 105 0.425 25.08 45 Control 105 0.773 45.61 a Control: 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.6 buer, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b- mercapto-ethanol, 30 mM Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mM NAD+, 0.3 mM gly- ceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 4±9 mg protein and 10% DMSO, in a total volume of 1000 ml.

Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 647 between the H-8 resonance and this 13C signal (J2), which also showed a cross peak with the methoxy pro- tons at 3.98/or 3.99 and the latter with the 13C signal at 56.3 or 56.9. In the same way, the signal for C-5 emerged from analysis of the correlation between the methoxy signal at 3.98/or 3.99 ( 62.2 by HSQC) and the 13C signal at 152.6, which did not show a correla- tion with the H-8 signal. The H-8 signal also showed a cross-peak with the 13C signal at 154.4 (J2), which was attributed to C-9, since it was the only carbon to be assigned in the A-ring. Flavone 8 exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 1H NMR spectrum for 30,40-substitution ( 7.54, dd, J=1.8 and 0.4 Hz, H-20; 6.98, dd, J=8.1 and 0.4 Hz, H-50; 7.51, dd, J=8.1 and 1.8, H-60). This spectrum also showed signals for a meta-coupled A-ring protons ( 6.55, d, J=2.3 Hz, H-6; 6.78, d, J=2.3 Hz, H-8), two methoxy groups ( 3.85, s, 6H) and one methylenedioxy group ( 6.07, s, 2H). The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) (Chen et al., 1997) fragments of this ¯avone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B-rings (Scheme 2). Thus, a combination of 1H NMR spectral data and the fragment ions at m/z 146 (70%) and 180 (5%) fully sup- port the presence of a 30,40-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and a 5,7-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. HSQC experiments permitted assignments of all proto- nated carbons (Table 3). However, the 13C signals at 96.8 and 93.7 were attributed to C-6 and C-8, and the 1H signals at 6.55 and 6.78 to H-6 and H-8, respectively, by com- parison with the resonances for the corresponding carbons and hydrogens in 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avone (5). The quaternary carbons of the A- and C-rings ( 160.2, C-2; 176.6, C-4; 161.3, C-5; 164.4, C-7; 160.1, C-9; 109.7, C-10) were also assigned by comparison with those of 5 ( 160.5, C-2; 177.5, C-4; 161.0, C-5; 164.1, C-7; 159.9, C- 9; 109.3, C-10), whose assignments were aided by 13C±1H COSY and long-range 13C±1H COSY spectra (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997). The signal for C-30 was established as 148.9 by its comparison with the reso- nance for the corresponding carbon in 6. The signal at 150.6 was then assigned to C-40. The structure of ¯avone 8 was thus established as 30,40-methylenedioxy-5,7- dimethoxy¯avone. Flavone 5 was previously obtained from N. alba (Arruda et al., 1993) and Murraya panicu- lata (Rutaceae) (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997). 30,40-Methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxy¯avone (7, age- cony¯avone A) has been found previously in Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae) (Vyas et al., 1986). However, its 13C NMR spectral data have not been reported previously in the literature. The chemical shifts of the A- and B-ring carbons were comparable with those for 6 and 8, respectively (Table 3). All phytochemical studies on Neoraputia genus have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation proce- dures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been pre- sent. However, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove Neoraputia to the Citroideae, which produces a con- siderable number of highly oxygenated ¯avones (Passa- dor et al., 1997; Silva, et al., 1988). Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of Neoraputia species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. Some compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from T. cruzi (Table 4). Chalcone 2 was sepa- rated from 4 and ¯avone 6 from 7 by R-HPLC; how- ever, they were obtained in very small amount. Thus, only the initial inhibitory activity of these mixtures were evaluated. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 45% when the mixture of 2 and 4 was added to the assay system at a concentration of 105 mg/ml, suggesting that these chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The mixture of 6 and 7 completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 100%) at 100 mg/ml. The activity of ¯avone 5 was comparable to that of the mixture of 6±7, reducing the enzymatic activity by 99% at 100 mg/ml. The 50% inhibitory concentration value (IC50) was 81 mM. Highly oxygenated ¯avones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal Scheme 2. Mass spectral fragmentation of 8. 648 D.M. Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 GAPDH. However, to develop an eective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make speci®c interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. For this purpose co-crystal- lization experiments with ¯avone 5 have been undertaken, both in laboratory and under microgravity conditions, in the NASA Space Shuttle during mission STS-91, in May 1998. Unfortunately, we did not have any success with ¯avone 5, and eective crystallization was observed only for a rutaceous coumarin. The related crystallographic studies are in progress and will be reported separately. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evi- dence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the speci®city in the catalytic-site- activity relationships among ¯avones and the enzyme GAPDH. Further crystallization experiments as well as solution studies by NMR spectral analysis are in progress. 3. Experimental 3.1.

Isolation of compounds Ground fruits (825 g) were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ®nally with MeOH. The conc. hexane extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using a hexane±CH2Cl2±MeOH gradient to give a mixture of fatty acids followed by 16 fractions. Fr 5 was rechromatographed on silica gel using hexane±CH2Cl2 gradient aording further frs. Fr 5-3 was rechromato- graphed as above, eluting with hexane±CH2Cl2±MeOH (15:5:1) yielding 1 (12 mg). The fraction containing 2 and 4 was then subjected to further ¯ash chromato- graphy as above, eluting with a hexane±Me2CO gra- dient, and then by R-HPLC (detection UV l 254 nm) to give 2 (2nd peak, 1.9 mg) and 4 (1st peak, 2.0 mg), after recycling 3. Fr containing 3 was applied to ¯ash chro- matography as above, eluting with a hexane±CH2Cl2 gra- dient, and then by prep. TLC (silica gel, hexane±CH2Cl2± MeOH (1:1:0.1) to yield pure 3 (6.1 mg). The concd CH2Cl2 extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a hexane±CH2Cl2±MeOH (1:1:0.2) aorded 16 frs. Fr 3 was subjected to ¯ash chromato- graphy on silica gel column, eluting with hexane± CH2Cl2±MeOH (1:1:0.1) to aord 4 new frs. Fr 3-2 was treated as above, eluting with a hexane±EtOAc gradient, to aord 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avanone (5.0 mg), after crystallization from MeOH. Fr 4 was recrystallized from MeOH and then puri®ed by prep. TLC (silica gel, benzene±CH2Cl2±Me2CO, 7:5:2) to give a mixt. of 6 and 7. This mixt. was submitted to R-HPLC (detection UV l 254 nm) to aord 6 (2nd peak, 2.0 mg) and 7 (1st peak, 2.5 mg), after recycling 3. Fr 6 was crystallized from MeOH yielding 5 (30 mg).

Preparation and puri®cation of recombinant T. cruzi GAPDH Tc GAPDH was overexpressed and puri®ed as reported by Souza et al. (1998). 3.5. T. cruzi GAPDH-activity Tc GAPDH activity was determined according to a modi®cation of a previously reported procedure (Barbosa and Nakano, 1987). Reduced NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 30 s intervals. The reaction medium was 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.6 buer, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b-mercapto-ethanol, 30 mM Na2 HAsO4, 2.5 mM NAD+, 0.3 mM glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate and 4±9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The speci®c activity (unit=U) of the enzyme was cal- culated as below: U=mg absorbance=t volume of cell =6:22 volume of enzyme enzyme where t=0.5 min; volume of cell=1.00 ml; eNADH= 6.22 (mMol/cm3)ÿ1 cmÿ1; volume of enzyme=0.005 ml; [ ] concentration of enzyme in mg/ml. 3.6. T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity The inhibitory activity was recorded using the reac- tion medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 ml. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30 s intervals. Com- pound 5 was tested at 30, 50 and 100 mg/ml in 10% DMSO using 5 ml of GAPDH-9 (prepared in January 1998) at 0.90 mg/ml. The mixture of 6 and 7 was tested at 25, 35 and 100 mg/ml in 10% DMSO using 5 ml of GAPDH-10 (prepared in February 1998) at 1.09 mg/ml. The mixture of 2 and 4 was tested at 105 mg/ml as for the mixture above. In each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO alone in the reaction medium and was used as a positive control. The speci®c activity of TcGAPDH was not signi®cantly aected by 10% DMSO alone. Data were means of three repetitions and values as a percent of control were used as follows: % inhibitory activity U=mg compound ÿ U=mg control=U=mg control 100: Acknowledgements The authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvol- vimento CientõÂ®co e TecnoloÂ gico (CNPq), FundacË aÄ o de Amparo aÁ Pesquisa do Estado de SaÄ o Paulo (FAPESP), CoordenacË aÄ o de AperfeicË oamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES), Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) and the World Health Organization (TDR grant 940854) for ®nancial support.

The antifungal activity of 1- O-b-d- and 8-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus was shown to be similar to that of the lignan sesamin. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) we reported the isolation and characterization of two C- glycosylated anthrones (picramniosides D, E), and two C-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B), as well as emodin and umbelliferone, from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis Tul., a tree found in Central America. Further investigations aorded, in minor quantities, two new C,O-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picramnioside F (1), and an oxathrone, mayoside C (2), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (3) and 8-O-b-d-gluco- pyranosyl emodin (4). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of com- pounds 1 and 2, and the antifungal activity of the iso- lated compounds. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract from the bark of P. teapensis aorded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds 1± 4, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shi- madzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones 3 and 4 were identi®ed on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992). Compound 1 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 671 ([M+1]+), 693 ([M+Na]+) and 709 ([M+K]+), with the base peak at m/z 509 ([M+1- C6H10O5]+). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

E-mail address: djbf@power.ufscar.br (J.B. Fernandes). All of the spectroscopic characteristics of 1 were coincident with those of anthrones which we have pre- viously reported (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at lmax 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cmÿ1), ester carbonyl (1735 cmÿ1) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cmÿ1) groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at 7.4±7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of meta-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at 3.40±3.95, indicating sugar moieties. The presence of 33 carbons was evident from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at 95.8 and 105.4. Signals in the region of 62±81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D±E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agree- ment with lyxose (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on SolõÂs et al. (1995) which identi®ed the sugar of picramniosides A±C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-O were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments con®rmed only one CH2 signal at 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit. Complete assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experi- ments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In parti- cular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) 3J coupling between the ester carbonyl ( 164.7) and H-10, H-200 and H-600, indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-10 of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) 3J coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-50 ( 81.4), con- ®rming the position of the aglycone at C-50 of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a 3J correlation of the anomeric 838 T. RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 837±841 proton of the glucose unit (H-1, 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the O-glucose unit at C-8. The magnitude of the coupling constant between H-50 and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an eq±eq conformation for these protons. The con®guration of the lyxose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (SolõÂs et al., 1995; HernaÂ ndez- Medel et al., 1998; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-10 and H-20 (J=0 Hz) suggesting an eq±eq conformation for these protons. Likewise, the J value of H-5000 (12 Hz) indicated an ax±ax conformation for H-5000 and H-4000 in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety. Further observations helped to establish the con®gura- tion at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of 1 (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picramnioside E (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the fol- lowing expected dierences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to O-glucosylation at C-8. Compound 2 was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of 2 gave pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 709 ([M+Na]+) and 725 ([M+K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]ÿ), which was consistent with the molecular for- mula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS±MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (m/z 563), lyxose (m/z 432), CH2OH (m/z 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corre- sponding to emodin (269). As observed previously for the mayosides (HernaÂ n- dez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed the same pattern described for 1, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of 2 had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). O-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound 2 at ring A. Assignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with pub- lished data (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not aord all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1000 with C-1 ( 162) helped to con®rm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1000. Circular dichroism con®rmed the absolute con®guration at C-10 of 1 and 2 as S and R, respectively.

RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 837±841 839 1 and 2 presented the same Cotton eects as picramnioside B and E (SolõÂs et al., 1995; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1999), namely a negative Cotton eect near 270 and 315 nm, and a positive Cotton eect near 350 nm. The compounds mayoside B, picramnioside E, 3, 4, emodin and umbelliferone were tested in the growth inhibition assay of Leucoagaricus gongilophorus, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. (1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds 3 and 4 presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in Sesamum indicum. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material. 3.

Plant material The bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San JoseÂ de la MontanÄ a, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica. 3.3. Isolation of constituents Dried and powdered bark of P. teapensis (615 g) was macerated with EtOH±H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was ®ltered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then n-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml minÿ1 UV detector at 254 nm), to aord compound 1 (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-O-b- (3) and 8-O-b-glucopy- ranosyl emodin (4). Further puri®cation of 3 (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and 4 (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described). Fraction 11 was submitted to HPLC separation under the same conditions (6.5 ml minÿ1, 7 cycles) to aord pure com- pound 2 (1.2 mg, 0.0004% w/w). 3.4.

Keywords: Petiveria alliacea; Phytolacaceae; Antifungal polysulphides 1. Introduction Petiveria alliacea L. (Phytolacaceae) is a shrub widely distributed in South and Central America. It grows in all regions of Brazil where it is known by many popular names. Among these, ‘‘erva-guine´ ’’, ‘‘guine´ ’’, ‘‘pipi’’ and ‘‘tipi’’; and the Tupi-Guarani ‘‘macuracaa´ ’’ are note- worthy (Hoehne, 1939; Pio Correa, 1969). In the State of Minas Gerais the roots of this plant are used to treat rheumatism (De Sousa et al., 1987) and in other Brazi- lian regions, both the roots and the leaves are popularly used as stimulants and abortefacients (Da Silva, 1935). Previous work on P. alliacea revealed the occurrence of coumarins, triterpenes and ﬂavonoids (Rocha and Da Silva, 1969; Delle Monache and Suarez, 1992), amino acids and trisulphide (Adegosan, 1974). In continuing our search for biologically active compounds from the Brazilian ﬂora (Carbonezi et al., 1999), a CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1 v/v) extract of the roots of this plant was selected for phytochemical investigation due to its signiﬁcant activity against some mutant yeast strains of Saccharomyces cer- evisiae (Gunatilaka et al., 1994) and inhibition of the growth of Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaer- ospermum (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). This study led to the isolation of ﬁve new polysulphides (2, 3, 5, 6 and 7), together with two known compounds (1, 4). Among the known compounds described in this study, only com- pound 4 had been previously isolated from this plant species (De Sousa et al., 1990). 2. Results and discussion The CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1) extract of roots of P. alliacea L. inhibited strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RS 188N, RS 52YK and RS 321) indicating strong activity of this extract towards the mutant strains of yeast. This extract was also shown to possess potent inhibitory activity against Cladosporium cladosporioides and Clado- sporium sphaerospermum fungi. Solvent–solvent par- titioning of the bioactive crude extract aﬀorded hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc fractions, in which the activities were concentrated. These fractions were individually sub- jected to silica gel column chromatography, using CH2Cl2 or CH2Cl2/MeOH as eluents, to obtain six major bioactive fractions. The puriﬁcation of these fractions was performed on silica gel preparative TLC, reversed-phase Sep Pak cartridge and HPLC aﬀording seven bioactive polysulphide compounds. 0031-9422/01/$ - see front matter # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

E-mail address: bolzaniv@iq.unesp.br (V. da S. Bolzani). The molecular formula of compound 1 was deter- mined as C6H14S2, by 1H, 13C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Three resonances at 2.66 t (J=7.25 Hz), 1.72 dq (J=7.5, 6.5) and 0.99 t (J=7.26 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum were characteristic of a propyl moiety (Table 1). The 13C NMR data also supported the propyl skeleton (Table 2). The proton resonance at 2.66, cor- responding to a methylene group, was attributed to a sulfur-bearing carbon atom, which was conﬁrmed by elemental analysis and interpretation of its mass spec- trum. According to these data the structure of 1 was assigned as dipropyl disulphide, which is reported as a natural derivative in Phytolacaceae for the ﬁrst time. Compounds 2–5 exhibited common features in their MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The presence of a sig- niﬁcant ion peak at m/z 91, which is characteristic of a benzyl fragment was observed in all mass spectra of these compounds. The benzyl portion appeared to bear one, two, three and four sulfur atoms, respectively, based on the elemental analyses. The 1H NMR spectra (Table 1) of 2, 3, 4 and 5 presented the same signal, around 7.30, compatible with a monosubstituted aromatic ring. The major diﬀerences observed in the 1H NMR spectra of each compound was due to the chemical shift of the methylene benzylic hydrogens linked to the sulfur, which in compound 2 appeared at 3.66; 3 at 4.05; 4 at 4.15 (De Souza et al., 1990) and 5 at 4.19, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) of these compounds, interpreted with the aid of DEPT spectra, indicated the presence of one quaternary C and ﬁve CH’s sp2 carbons attributable to an aromatic monosubstituted ring and one sp3 CH2 assigned to a benzylic carbon. The ele- mental analysis and HRMS data of compounds 2–5 ﬁrmly established the number (and amount) of sulfur atoms in these polysulphides and conﬁrmed their iden- tities as dibenzyl sulphide (2), dibenzyl disulphide (3), dibenzyl trisulphide (4) and dibenzyl tetrasulphide (5), respectively. Polysulphide 4 has previously been reported from this species (De Souza et al., 1990). Compound 6, isolated as an oil, gave IR absorption bands at 3335 (OH), 1580, and 1495 cm1 (Ar). The EI MS showed a molecular ion peak [M]+ at m/z 154 that together with 13C NMR and elemental analysis estab- lished a molecular formula of C8H10SO. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) of this compound resem- bled closely those of dibenzyl sulphide (2). Prominent dif- ferences in the 1H and 13C spectroscopic values between 2 and 6 were observed only in the aliphatic region; one extra methylene signal was observed at 5.03 s ( 78.50, CH2). These results allowed us to deduce that compound Fig. 1. Selected HMBC correlations for compounds 6 and 7.

Coelho Benevides et al. / Phytochemistry 57 (2001) 743–747 6 had an hydroxymethyl group linked to the sulfur in place of the second benzylic group as in compound 2. Interpretation of some HMBC data (Fig. 1) aided eluci- dation of this structure. Correlations observed between the methylene protons signal at 5.03 with the benzylic carbon at 44.27 and the methylene protons signal at 3.60 with the carbons at 78.50 and 127.42 established compound 6 as benzylhydroxymethyl monosulphide. Polysulphide 7 is closely comparable with dibenzyl tri- sulphide (4); comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) data with those of 4 showed that the only diﬀerences observed were due to chemical shift of the benzylic hydrogens, which in 7 appeared at 4.20 (C=43.19) and the presence of an additional singlet signal at 5.30, which was attributed to methylene pro- tons by the analysis inferred by COSY, HMQC and DEPT spectral data. Analysis of 13C NMR spectro- scopic data recorded a methylene benzylic carbon at 43.19 and a second one, extremely unshielded at 106.32, whose chemical shift could be explained by the stereo- eletronic eﬀects of several sulfur atoms linked to meth- ylene carbon. In fact, no correlations were observed in the spectra of the 1H–1H COSY and HMBC (Fig. 1) of the corresponding methylene protons with other protons or carbons, respectively in 7. The elemental analysis, together with HRMS analysis established its molecular formula as C15H16S6 and thus conﬁrmed 7 to be di(ben- zyltrithio) methane. Bioautography with the plant pathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was employed to guide fractionation and isolation of the polysulphides 1– 7, these being responsible for the fungicidal activity detected in the crude extract (Table 3). Similar or higher to the reference compound Nystatin, the polysulphides 1–4 showed potent inhibition, while compounds 5–7 showed marginal activity against fungal growth (10.0 >25 and 5.0 mg, respectively), in both phytopathogenic strains tested. Furthermore, their potential anticancer activities were also tested, using a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka et al., 1994). Compounds 1, 3 and 5 had moderate eﬀect on DNA, as deduced by the selective inhibition of the mutant strains RS 321 and RS 52YK, relative to the wild strain RS 188N (Table 3). 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation 1H NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer, using TMS as an int. standard. The 13C NMR (50 or 75 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 and DPX-300 spectro- meter. EI-MS were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/ 5988 A spectrometer and on a VG platform II spectro- meter. Elemental analysis was performed on a Perkin- Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer 2400. IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR 1750 Perkin Elmer and FT-IR 510 Nicolet. UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV/vis Hitachi U-3000. 3.2. Plant material The species Petiveria alliacea L. was collected in Sep- tember and October (1997) in the Instituto Butanta˜ Reserve, in the city of Sa˜ o Paulo. Whole shrubs were collected and separated in their distinct parts: leaves, stems and roots. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆ nica-SMA, under the number SP112.6.84. 3.3.

TLC bioautography assay: Cladosporium cladospor- ioides Fresen de Vries SPC 140 and Cladosporium sphaerospermum Penzig SPC 491 were maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆ nica-SMA. Ten microliters of the solutions of crude extracts, fractions and pure com- pounds were prepared, in diﬀerent concentrations: cor- responding to 20, 10, 1, 0.1 mg for pure compounds and 100, 50, 30 and 20 mg for the crude extracts or fractions, respectively. The samples were applied to TLC plates, these being eluted with the appropriate solvent system followed by complete removal of the solvent. The chro- matographic plates were sprayed with spores suspension of C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides in a nutri- tive medium and incubated for 48 h at 37C. After incubation, clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background chromatogram. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents Roots, stems, and leaves of P. alliacea L. were dried at room temperature, powdered and extracted three times with CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1, v/v), for two days, at room temperature. The resulting extracts were ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to yield 7.0, 8.0 and 15 g of root, stem and leaf extracts, respectively. Due to the higher bioactivity noted, half of the root extract was sus- pended in MeOH:H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. After liquid/liquid partition, the resulting residue was concentrated in vacuo and extracted with H2O. Bioactiv- ity-guided fractionation of the hexane, CHCl3, and EtOAc solubles, using silica gel column chromatography and hexane, CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2:EtOAc and CH2Cl2:MeOH (with increasing polarity) as eluants, aﬀorded several fractions, whose bioactivities were detected only in six of them. The ﬁrst hexane fraction was applied to a Si gel column eluting with a hexane:CH2Cl2 gradient to aﬀord compound 1 (22 mg). The fractions eluted with CH2Cl2:EtOAc were further subjected to silica gel col- umn chromatography using a MeOH:H2O gradient. The intermediary fractions of this column, puriﬁed by HPLC using a C-18 Econosil column, 5 mm, 2504 mm i.d., with an elution gradient of MeOH:H2O (70:30) 7 min; MeOH:H2O (90:10) 15 min. and MeOH (100%) 20 min with ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min yielded the compounds 2 (7.8 mg), 3 (4.5 mg), 4 (15.0 mg) and 5 (3.6 mg). The EtOAc soluble fraction, was subjected to Si gel column chromatography using CH2Cl2:EtOAc with increasing polarity. The fractions obtained with CH2Cl2: EtOAc (7:3) aﬀorded 6 (3.8 mg). Compound 7 (2.0 mg) was isolated from the hexane fraction, by further puriﬁca- tion over column chromatography on Si gel eluted with CH2Cl2:EtOAc (8:2). 3.4.1.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of Piper arboreum yielded two new amides, N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) together with the known compounds N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E), 9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4). Catalytic hydrogenation of 3 yielded the amide N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5). We also have isolated six amides (6–11) and two antifungal cinnamoyl derivatives (12, 13) from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum. Compounds 1–11 showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against Cladosporium sphaerospermum while compounds 3-4 and 6–13 also showed antifungal activity against C. cladosporioides. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Keywords: Piper arboreum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Chemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, lig- noids and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996; Parmar et al, 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadie- noyl]pyrrolidine, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl- 8-(30,40-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Ale´ cio et al., 1998) and 8(Z)-N- (12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one from Piper tuberculatum Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)- pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) and nine (3–11) known antifungal amides N-[10- (13,14-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3), its deri- vative N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)- 7(E),9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4); besides pellitorine (6), abdihydropiperine (7), piplartine (8), dihydro- piplartine (9), cis-piplartine (or 8(Z)-N-(12,13, 14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one) (10) and fagaramide (11). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxy- dihydrocinnamate (12) and methyl trans-6,7,8-trimethox- ycinnamate (13). The amides isolated from leaves of Piper arboreum (1–4) and the hydrogenated derivative of 3 (5) were active against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum 3, 4 and 6–13 0031-9422/02/$ - see front matter # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results and discussion N-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pen- tadienoil]-pyrrolidine (1) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electro- spray mass spectrum (ES–MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data.

Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.93 (2H, s), and four oleﬁnic protons which showed signals at 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7=14.3 and J8,9=10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8=10.9 and J9,10=11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9= 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the E and Z geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the E and Z conﬁgurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of trans-trans conﬁguration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assign- ment of the cis conﬁguration for the g, double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at 3.52 (2H, m) and 1.90 (2H, m) attrib- uted to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of 1 were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-ﬁeld region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 164.8, 10 sp2 car- bons, four sp3 carbons [C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Arau´ jo-Junior et al., 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). Arboreumine (2) was shown to have the molecular formula C25H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES–MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respec- tively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at 2.15 (2H, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H- 20a and H-2b, H-20b which are characteristic of methyl- ene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-90, at 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at 1.20 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-110; H-13, H-120; H-14, H-130 and H-11, H-100, respectively. The signal at 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as conﬁrmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-50; H-8, H-70 and H-9, H-80 showed signals at 5.81 (q, J6,1250,110= 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (dd, J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1,0 Hz) and 5.76 (dd, J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further conﬁrmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-70; H-9, H- 80 and H-10, H-90 was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at 5.76 assigned to H- 9, H-80 (J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-70 (J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-90 (J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 assigned to H-11, H- 100 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-20a (J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at 2.37 assigned to H- 2b, H-20b (J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spec- tral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum. The carbon signals at 49.5 and 40.9 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 1 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 1 1H [m, J (Hz), 200 MHz] 13C (50 MHz) 2 3.52 (2H, m) 45.8 3 1.90 (2H, m) 26.0 4 1.90 (2H, m) 24.2 5 3.52 (2H, m) 46.5 6 – 164.8 7 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3) 121.1 8 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7 and 8,9=14.3, 10.9) 144.4 9 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8 and 9,10=10.9, 11.4) 121.0 10 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9=11.4) 134.9 11 – 127.0 12 6.78 (1H, d, J12,16=1.7) 108.1 13 – 145.6 14 – 147.5 15 6.75 (1H, d, J15,16=8.1) 108.7 16 6.82 (1H, dd, J16,15 and 16,12=8.1, 1.7) 122.1 OCH2O 5.93 (2H, s) 100.7 R. Vasques da Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 59 (2002) 521–527 523 assigned to C-2, C-20 and C-3, C-30, respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the car- bon (C-3 and C-30), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at 198.3 and the 3H singlet at 0.95 (C- 14 and C-130) indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-20a and H-2b, H-20b ( 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 ( 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-120 and C-14, C-130 and H-14, H-130 and C-13, C-120 were also observed. The carbon signals at 163.9 (C-5, C-40), 126.1 (C-6, C-50) and 40.9 (C-3, C-30) showed a correla- tion with the 1H singlet at 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at 2.15 (H-2a, H-20a), corroborating the adjacent rela- tionship between the amide group and C-2, C-20. The carbon signals at 67.3 (C-10, C-90) and 135.6 (C-9, C- 80) showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-100 adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,- unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambigu- ously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 110 with the carbon signals 126.1 (C-6, C- 50) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70), whereas the quadruplet at 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-50 (J6,1250,110=1,0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70). Finally, HET- COR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide 2 was determined as depicted. The CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of P. tuberculatum were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C6H14 con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to aﬀord compounds 6–13. Pellitorine (6) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further puriﬁcation, and it was identiﬁed by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data pre- viously described by Rosario et al., 1996. a,bdihydro piperine (7) and dihydropiplartine (9) had their 1H NMR spectra published for the same compounds pre- viously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and Piper guineense (Parmar et al., 1997) and their 13C NMR spectral data recently pub- lished (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (8) was iso- lated from seeds and leaves, and the 1H and 13C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). Cis-piplartine (10) had its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (11) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl trans-6,7,8-tri- methoxycinnamate (13) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectro- scopic data were similar to that obtained in this work. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–13 was deter- mined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of com- pounds 1–13 (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered. The minimum amount of compounds 3–4; 2 and 5; and 1 required to inhibit growth of the fungus C. sphaero- spermum on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the stan- dards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against C. cladosporioides, the amide 4 being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds 6–10, 13 and 11, 12 the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus C. clados- porioides on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for 6–10 and 13 indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from P. arboreum are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the Table 2 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 2 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 2 1H [m, J (Hz), 500 MHz] 13C a (125 MHz) 1, 10 2.80 (1H, s) – 2a, 20a 2.15 (1H, d, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0) 49.5 (t) 2b, 20b 2.37 (1H, d, J 2b,2a20b,20a=17.0) 3, 30 – 40.9 (s) 4 – 198.3 (s) 5, 40 – 163.9 (s) 6, 50 5.81 (1H, q, J6,1250,110=1.0) 126.1 (d) 7, 60 – b 8, 70 5.70 (1H, dd, J8,970,80 and 8,1270,110=15.5, 1.0) 128.6 (d) 9, 80 5.76 (1H, dd, J9,880,70 and 9,1080,90=15.5, 5.0) 135.6 (d) 10, 90 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80 and 10,1190,100=5.0, 6.5) 67.3 (d) 11, 100 1.20 (3H, d, J 11,10100,90=6.5) 23.4 (q) 12, 110 1.83 (3H, s) 19.0 (q) 13, 120 1.00 (3H, s) 22.7 (q) 14, 130 0.95 (3H, s) 23.8 (q) a Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment. b This signal was not observed in the 13C NMR spectrum. 524 R.

It is important to note that the inhibi- tion of C. sphaerospermum by dihydropyridone amide 9 appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of C. cladosporioides was lower than the standards (Table 4). 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck 230–400 mesh) was used for all col- umn chromatography unless otherwise stated and sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spec- trometer. ES–MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), ﬂow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were per- formed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser. 3.2. Plant material Piper arboreum H. B. K. leaves were collected in Araraquara—SP, Brazil and identiﬁed by Dr. Guil- lermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Bio- cie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. Piper tuberculatum Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA—Manaus, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher speci- mens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biocie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. 3.3. Antifungal assays The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C. cladospor- ioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Bota.nica, Sa˜ o Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay—10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds 1–5 and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds 6–13, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in dark- ness in a moistened chamber at 25 C. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of 1–5 and 6–13 required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chlor- amphenicol were used as negative controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents A CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of P. arboreum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides 1–4. The dried and powdered leaves of P. arboreum (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The result- ing EtOH extract was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively.

Fraction 19 (1.7 g) was applied to a C18 HPLC column (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). After that the fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2: (CH3)2CO (92:02) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 1 (28.0 mg) and 3 (31.0 mg). Fraction 21 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 col- umn (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC eluted with CH2Cl2:(CH3)2CO:MeOH (92:0.5:0.5) and HOAc (1%) to give 2 (8.0 mg). Fraction 23 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 column (2.0 g) and eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2:C6H14: (CH3)2CO (6:3:1) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 3 (83.0 mg) and 4 (30.0 mg). The dried and powdered seeds and leaves of P. tuber- culatum (24.3 g) were extracted 2 with 600 ml of CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1), during 2 days (each extraction), at room temperature. The resulting extract of seeds was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 8 (33.0 mg) and 10 (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yiel- ded 9 (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds 6 (0.2 g) and 7 (18.0 mg), respec- tively, without any further puriﬁcation. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26–62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier. Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide 8 (0.9 g), without further puriﬁcation. Amide 11 (7.0 mg) was isolated from fraction 55 (0.2 g), which was further puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O(4:1)]. Fraction 28 (0.4 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), two elutions] yielding the cinnamoyl derivative 12 (66.0 mg) and fraction 67–68 (0.4 g) was puriﬁed by two prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1), two elutions and C6H14: EtOAc (7:3), one elution], respectively, to yield the cin- namoyl derivative 13 (13.0 mg). 3.5.

(Rubiaceae), a huge endemic tree from the Amazon, has been traditionally used for the treatment of numerous human ailments including mycoses, inﬂuenza, diverse infections, cancer and skin diseases throughout ‘‘legal Amazonia,’’ which includes Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia (Correa, 1974; Rizzini, 1978; Garcia, 1975). In Peruvian Ama- zon, a decoction of the bark is used against ‘‘sarna negra’’, a subcutaneous infection caused by an arachnid (Schultes and Raﬀauf, 1990). In Brazilian Amazon, this species is known to treat stomach diseases, skin inﬂam- mation and uterus tumors (Garcia, 1975). As part of our continuing eﬀorts to study Brazilian Rubiaceae, mainly those with medicinal uses (Carbonezi et al., 1998), C. spruceanum DC was collected near Manaus, Amazon State, and submitted to a detailed chemical study. Three new seco-iridoids were obtained from the ethanolic extract of C. spruceanum wood bark: 7- methoxydiderroside (1), 60-acetyl-b-D-glucopyr- anosyldiderroside (2) and 8-O-tigloyldiderroside (3), and the known compounds loganetin (Houghton and Ming, 1985), loganin (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Garcia and Chulia, 1986), kingiside (Inouye et al., 1974), secoxyloganin (Calis and Sticher, 1984) and diderroside (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). Several natural products and synthetic compounds, e.g. sesquiterpenelactones from Asteraceae species (Chiari et al., 1991), lignans from Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae) (Lopes et al., 1998) and quinoline derivatives (Nakayama et al., 2001) have been evaluated for antitrypanosomal activity against T. cruzi, the parasite of Chagas disease, which aﬀects ca. 18 million people in Latin America and ca. 100,000 people in the United States. Besides prophy- laxis, i.e. the elimination of vector insect, speciﬁc ther- apeutic agents are needed in order to replace gentian violet, currently in use, owing to the mutagenic and 0031-9422/03/$ - see front matter # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the isolation and structure elucidation of the new seco-iridoids 1–3 along with the known compounds are presented. Additionally, the biological evaluation of all isolates against the try- pomastigote forms (Y form) of T. cruzi was undertaken. The taxonomic signiﬁcance of these seco-iridoids in C. spruceanum, is also discussed. 2. Results and discussion The ethanolic extract of dried and powdered wood bark of C. spruceanum was successively fractionated over a silica gel column and ﬁnally puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC (see Experimental), aﬀording the new seco-iridoids 1–3. seco-Iridoid 1 was isolated as an amorphous powder that gave a [M+H]+ ion at m/z 479.4539 in the high-resolution TOF-ESMS compatible with the molecular formula C20H30O13. The UV max- imum at 230 nm and IR absorptions at 3450, 1695, 1635 and 1280 cm1 suggested that 1 had a conjugated dou- ble bond and an enol ether, which is characteristic of the chromophore –OCO–C=CH–O– of iridoids. This assumption was supported by the NMR signal observed at 7.44 (1H, s) characteristic of H-3 from iridoids. Besides this signal, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed three doublets at 5.66 (1H, J=4.5 Hz), 4.54 (1H, J=7.5 Hz) and 1.26 (3H, J=6.5 Hz), one double quadruplet at 4.97 (1H, J=4.0; 6.5 Hz) and several signals compatible with a glucosyl unit. In addition, the signals at 1.92 (3H, s), 3.54 (3H, s) and 3.58 (3H, s) analyzed with 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 2), revealed the presence of an acetyl and two methoxyl groups. The 13C NMR spectroscopic spectrum exhibited twenty signals (4CH3, 2CH2, 10CH, and 4C) whose chemical shift values and multiplicities obtained from the DEPT-135 experiment strongly support the seco- iridoid skeleton for 1, especially the signals of C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9 and C-10 at 28.6, 34.7, 172.0, 68.6 and 42.2 respectively. The structure of 1 was conﬁrmed by 2D-NMR spectral analysis including 1H–1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments. In the HMBC experiment, long-range correlations were observed between the following protons and carbons (H-1 and C- 3, 5, 8, 10; H-3 and C-5, 11; H-5 and C-3, 7, 1; H-8 and C-1, 5, 10, carbonyl of acetate) as shown in Fig. 1. The relative conﬁguration of the stereogenic centers C-1, C- 5, C- 8 and C-9 was established by analyzing coupling constant values, NOESY experiments and comparison with literature data (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). The above evidence indicated 1 as the new derivative 7- methoxydiderroside (1).

Zuleta et al. / Phytochemistry 64 (2003) 549–553 The 1H and 13C NMR spectral signals (Tables 1 and 2) for compound 2 were found to be similar to those observed for 1, except for the lack of one methoxyl group and one additional acetyl group. The change from one methoxyl to one acetyl group was also observed by HRTOF-ESMS, which showed a molecular ion peak at m/z [M+H]+ 507.4725. In fact, when the 13C NMR spectral data of compound 2 were compared with those of diderroside, the only diﬀerence observed was the presence of one addi- tional acetyl group inferred by the chemical shift values at 20.6 (correlating with the singlet at 2.00, in the HMQC spectrum), and 170.3. It was also observed that the sig- nals attributed to the hydroxymethylene carbon and hydrogens in the glucosyl unit are deshielded [ 63.4; 4.26 (dd, J=3.2, 12.0 Hz) and 4.06 (dd, J=6.5, 12.0 Hz)], when compared with the values observed in a typical glucose moiety present in iridoids (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Boros and Stermitz, 1990; Boros and Stermitz, 1991). From the HMBC spectrum of 2 (Fig. 1), the diagnostic long-range correlations were observed, including those from H-8 to the carbonyl at 169.3; from H-10 to C-8 and C-9; and from H-6 to the car- bonyl at 173.0. In addition, the correlation of H-60 to C-40 and C-50 as well as to the carbonyl at 170.3, established the position of the acetyl group at C-60. The cross peak observed for the methyl at 2.00 to the car- bonyl at 170.3, was deﬁnitive to indicate that this ace- tyl was linked to hydroxymethylene C-60 of the glucosyl moiety and establish the structure of 2 as being 60-ace- tyl-b-d-glucopyranosyldiderroside. Compound 3 was obtained as a brown amorphous solid. The molecular formula, C22H32O13 was estab- lished by HRTOF-ESMS (m/z 527.4797 [M+Na]+). This compound also presented a sulphuric vanillin col- oration identical to those of 1 and 2 suggesting that it was an iridoid. Its UV spectrum (lMeOH max 230, 297 nm), as well as its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data indicated that Fig. 1. Some selected HMBC correlations for seco-iridoids 1–3.

The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed one signal for hydrogen H-3 at 7.42 (1H, s), which suggested the presence of an iri- doid skeleton, a doublet at 4.59 (1H, J=8.0) and several signals ranging from 2.99 to 3.70 attributed to the anomeric, methine and methylene hydrogens of the glu- cosyl moiety. The signals at 5.09 (1H, dq, J=3.5, 6.5 Hz), and 1.30 (3H, d, J=6.5 Hz) were compatible with those from diderroside skeleton type for this compound, as in 1 and 2. However, additional NMR spectral sig- nals at 6.79, 1.76 and 1.74, and the signals at 137.4, 14.1 and 11.8, indicated that this compound exhibited signiﬁcant diﬀerences from the signals observed in diderrosides 1 and 2. The 1H–1H COSY spectrum from 3 showed a cross peak between the signal at 6.79 (1H, dq, J=1.5, 6.5) and the signal at 1.76 (3H, d, J=1.5). In the HMQC experiments the signals at 1.74 (3H, br s), 1.76 (3H, d, J=1.5) attributed to H-500 and H-400 respec- tively and 6.79 (1H, dq, J=1.5, 6.5), correlated with the carbons at 11.8 (C-500), 14.1 (C-400) and 137.4 (C-300), respectively. The combined analysis from these data and the presence of a sp2 carbon at 128.1 suggested the exis- tence of a tigloyl unit in this molecule, which was further determined to be linked at C-8 ( 68.6). The HMBC correlations between the signal for H-8 at 5.09 with car- bons C-100 ( 166.3), C-10 ( 18.8) and C-1 ( 94.1); H-3 at 7.42 with carbons C-11 ( 166.2), C-4 ( 109.1); methoxyl hydrogens with C-11; H-300 at 6.79 with C-400 ( 14.1), C- 200 ( 128.1) and C-100 ( 166.3) corroborated the proposed structure for 3 as 8-O-tigloyldiderroside. This is the ﬁrst report on the chemical composition of C. spruceanum, a species included in Cinchonoideae, which revealed the presence of iridoid and seco-iridoids, a che- mical proﬁle quite diﬀerent from those previously descri- bed (Bolzani et al., 1984). This sub-family is characterized by indole alkaloids, which are considered as their chemical markers (Young et al., 1996). A comparison of the chemi- cal composition of Calycophyllum with two species mor- phologically related such as Chimarrhis (accumulates indole alkaloids) and Bathysa (accumulates triterpenes and phenolics), revealed deep diﬀerences on the main isolated secondary metabolites. These species are often misplaced in their genera (Delprete, 1996), so further chemical studies on Calycophyllum and allies will be useful to establish the boundaries of each genera, and will con- tribute to the taxonomic classiﬁcation of Rubiaceae, which is considered a very complex taxon (Robbrecht, 1993). All compounds were assayed in vitro against the try- pomastigote forms (Y form) of T. cruzi. The new com- pounds 1, 2 and the known secoxyloganin and diderroside displayed activity with IC50 values of 59.0, 90.2, 74.2 and 84.9 mg/ml, respectively, when compared with the standard gentian violet (IC50 7.5 mg/ml). Although these compounds have showed weak activ- ities, to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report of the antitrypanosomal activity by seco-iridoids. 3. Experimental 3.1. General Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 C. UV spectra were recorded on Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectro- photometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on VARIAN DRX-500 spectro- meter, using TMS as internal standard. ES-MS was conducted on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRTOF-ESMS was performed using a Q-Tof (Micro- mass) (40 eV). CC was carried out on silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Sephadex LH 20 (Pharmacia), respectively. TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde- H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Prep HPLC was performed on Waters Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C-18 (250 mm 21.20 mm, Phenom- enex) columns. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated C. spruceanum plant material was col- lected in Manaus, Brazil, in July and August 1998. A voucher specimen was identiﬁed by Dr. J. A. da S. Cabral and deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazoˆ nia (INPA), Manaus (Voucher No 1998-182.249). 3.3. Bioassay screening In vitro assay using trypomastigote forms (Y strain) from T. cruzi was performed according to the protocol described in the literature (Bastos et al., 1999). 3.4. Extraction and isolation Pulverized dried wood bark from C. spruceanum (1.7 kg) was extensively extracted using MeOH at room temp. The combined extracts were concentrated in vacuo to give a dark solid (230 g), which was partitioned between n-BuOH and H2O aﬀording an n-BuOH (64 g) and an aqueous (107 g) soluble fraction. The n-BuOH fraction was suspended in aqueous MeOH 80% and suc- cessively partitioned with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction (20.8 g) was subjected to XAD-2 chro- matograph using H2O with increasing proportions of MeOH (20–100%). Fractions I and II, obtained from this procedure, were further submitted to CC using Sephadex LH 20 as stationary phase and MeOH as isocratic mobile phase, yielding 21 fractions (F1–F21). 552 L.M.C. Zuleta et al. / Phytochemistry 64 (2003) 549–553 F-5 was further puriﬁed by means of HPLC coupled to a prep reversed phase column using MeOH/H2O/HOAC (23:76.6:0.5) as mobile phase, UV detection set at 280 nm and a ﬂow rate of 10 mL.min1, gave pure loganin (11.6 mg), diderroside (5.3 mg) and the new derivative 3 (11.6 mg). F-11 was puriﬁed with a similar chromatographic procedure, only varying the mobile phase MeOH/H2O (27.5:72.5), giving diderroside (12.3 mg). Fraction F-18 was also subjected to HPLC puriﬁcation using MeOH/ H2O/HOAc (27:72.5:0.5) as mobile phase, ﬂow rate set at 8 mL.min1 to aﬀord secoxiloganin (5.7 mg), loganetin (2.0 mg), diderroside (2.1 mg) and the new compounds 1 (11 mg), 2 (13.6 mg) and 3 (1.2 mg). 3.4.1.

Keywords: Piper aduncum; Piperaceae; Chromenes; Prenylated benzoic acid; Dihydrochalcone; Nerolidol; DNA-damaging activity 1. Introduction Chemical studies carried out on Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of a variety of com- pounds including essential oils, pyrones, lignoids and unsaturated amides (Parmar et al., 1997; AleÂ cio, Bolzani, Young, Kato, & Furlan, 1998). The species Piper aduncum L. is used as remedy for stomach aches and as an insect repellent (Asprey & Thornton, 1954). Previous investigations on P. aduncum have described phenylpropanoids, such as myristicin and dillapiol, benzoic acid derivatives, chromenes and ¯avonoids (Burke & Nair, 1986; Orjala, Eldelmeier, Wright, Rali, & Sticher, 1993a; 1993b; Moreira, GuimaraÄ es, & Kaplan, 1998). During the course of chemical studies on P. aduncum we isolated seven compounds, including a new chromene 1 and a new benzoic acid derivative 5. In the search for potential anticancer agents employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka, Samaranayake, Kingston, Hofmann, & Johnson, 1992; Gunatilaka, Kingston, & Johnson, 1994), it was found that the chromenes 2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3'-methyl-2'-butenyl)-2H-1-chromene- 6-carboxylate (2), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene- 6-carboxylate (3), methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-chromene-6-carboxylate (4) and the benzoic acid de- rivative, 3-(3',7'-dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-4-methoxy- benzoic acid (5), were active. Although chromene and benzoic acid derivatives are frequently isolated from Piper species and many of them exhibit diverse biologi- cal activity such as antimicrobial, molluscicidal (Orjala et al., 1993b), germination inhibition, fungicidal (Nair & Burke, 1990) and insecticidal activities (Bernard et al., 1995), there is no previous report describing dama- ging eect on DNA. In this paper we report the struc- ture elucidation for two new isolated compounds 1 and 5 and the growth inhibitory eects of compounds 1±5 against strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Results and discussion A CH2Cl2-soluble part of MeOH extract of the leaves of P. aduncum was fractionated by CC on silica gel followed by HPLC to aord compounds 1±5, nero- lidol and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone. 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1) was shown to have a molecular formula C12H12O3 by analysis of its electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS), 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 2400±3400/1680 and 1600/1445 cmÿ1 characteristic of carboxylic acid and aromatic groups, respectively. Its 1H NMR spectrum exhibited close similarities to those of 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chro- mene-6-carboxylate 3 (Burke & Nair, 1986) by the pre- sence of two doublets at d 5.65 and 6.34 (9.9 Hz) and a singlet at d 1.46 (2 CH3) and, as in the case of 3, its spectrum showed three aromatic signals at d 7.86 (dd, J=2.0 and 8.4 Hz), 7.72 (d, J=2.0 Hz) and 6.79 (d, J=8.4 Hz), corroborating the presence of a trisubsti- tuted aromatic ring. As indicated by IR and by 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1), the methyl ester func- tion in 3 was replaced by a carboxylic acid function (dC 171.0) and the structure of compound 1 was deter- mined as depicted. 3-(3',7'-dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (5) has the molecular formula C18H22O4 deduced by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and 13C NMR data. In its IR spectrum, absorptions for an aromatic acid carbonyl group (1680 cmÿ1) and an aromatic ring (1600, 1490 cmÿ1) were present, while the UV spectrum displayed an absorption maximum at 254 nm (log E 3.8) corresponding to the aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 5 showed sig- nals corresponding to three coupled aromatic reson- ances at d 6.87 (d, 1H, J=8.4 Hz), 7.88 (d, 1H, J=2.2 Hz) and 7.96 (dd, 1H J=8.4, 2.2 Hz) for a 1,4,5-tri- substituted aromatic ring and dH 1.34 (1H, s); it also displayed a singlet at 3.90 (3H, s) for a carboxylic acid Table 1 1H and 13C NMR (200 and 50 MHz, respectively, CDCl3, J in Hertz) data for compounds 1 and 5 1 5 H Ca H Ca 1 ± ± ± 122.5 (s) 2 ± 77.2 (q) 7.88 d (2.2) 130.8b (d) 3 5.65 d (9.9) 131.0 (d) ± 129.7b (s) 4 6.34 d (9.9) 121.4 (d) ± 160.7 (s) 4a ± 120.7c (s) ± ± 5 7.72 d (2.0) 128.7 (d) 6.87 d (8.4) 109.2 (d) 6 ± 121.5c (s) 7.96 dd (8.4, 2.2) 129.3 (d) 7 7.86 dd (8.4, 2.0) 131.8 (d) ± ± 8 6.79 d (8.4) 116.3 (d) ± ± 8a ± 157.9 (s) ± ± 9 1.46 28.4 (q) ± 10 1.46 28.4 (q) ± 1' ± ± 3.34 d (7.3) 28.0 (t) 2' ± ± 5.31 t (7.3) 121.6 (d) 3' ± ± ± 136.1 (s) 4' ± ± 2.07 m 39.8 (t) 5' ± ± 2.07 m 26.4 (t) 6' ± ± 5.10 t (7.2) 124.0 (d) 7' ± ± ± 131.0 (s) 8' ± ± 1.67 s 25.4 (q) 9' ± ± 1.71 s 15.8 (q) 10' ± ± 1.60 s 17.4 (q) OCH3 ± ± 3.90 s 55.2 (q) COOH ± 171.0 (s) ± 168.4 (s) a Multiplicities for carbon signals were obtained by DEPT 1358 ex- periments. b Interchangeable assignments. c Interchangeable assignments.

The monoterpene side chain signals were determined from DQCOSY and HETCOR spectra. Thus, the methylene protons H-1' at d 3.34 (2H, d, J=7.3 Hz) were coupled to the ole®- nic proton H-2' at d 5.31 (1H, t, J=7.3 Hz), which in turn showed an allylic coupling to the methyl group H-9' at d 1.71 (3H, s). The methine proton H-6' at d 5.10 (1H, t, J=7.2 Hz) was further coupled to the methylene proton H-5' at d 2.07 (2H, m). The E geo- metry for the D2'3'-double bond was established on the basis of the 13C NMR data of the vinyl methyl group H-9' (De Haan & van de Ven, 1973). The position of the monoterpene moiety was deduced by NOESY spectrum analysis and by comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data with those published for methyl 3-(3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienyl)-4-methoxy- benzoate (Orjala et al., 1993b). The known compounds 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3-methyl-2- butenyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate (2), methyl 2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (3), methyl 8- hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (4) and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone were previously isolated from the same source (Burke & Nair, 1986; Diaz, Arias, & Nathan, 1987; Orjala et al., 1993a; Moreira et al., 1998), while nerolidol (Ramos, Da Silva, Luz, Zoghbi, & Maia, 1986) was isolated for the ®rst time from P. aduncum. Compounds 1±5 were evaluated against genetically engineered mutants of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have showed IC12 values of 120 and 100; 130 and 100; 105 and 120; 110 and 120; 130 and 120 mg/ml against the mutant yeast strains RS 321N and RS 322YK (rad 52Y), respectively. Even though the ac- tivity could be considered weak, they were selective towards mutant strains lacking DNA cleavage repair mechanism since they were inactive (IC12>1,000 mg/ ml) against the `wild type' strain RS 188N (rad +) (Gunatilaka et al., 1992; 1994). As there is no previous report on the activity of chromene compounds on DNA, the data obtained here are the basis for our further search for antitumoral or fungicidal com- pounds in the Piperaceae. 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck 230±400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, re- spectively, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as refer- ence. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES±MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were per- formed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reversed phase column (Waters Nova Pak, C18; 3.9 150 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (3:2), ¯ow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. 3.2. Plant material Piper aduncum L. (Piperaceae) leaves were collected at Reserva da Ripasa, IbateÂ , SP and identi®ed by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, PeruÂ ). The voucher specimen is deposited at Departamento de Ecologia, Instituto de BiocieÃ ncias-USP. 3.3. Bioassays The screening methods utilizing mutant strains of S. cerevisiae have been described elsewhere (Gunatilaka et al., 1992). IC12 values refer to the concentration in mg/ml required to produce an inhibition zone of 12 mm diameter around a 100 ml well during a 48 h incu- bation period at 378C. The positive control camptothe- cin was active at 5.0 ml/ml for RS 322YK and at 200 ml/ml for RS 188N; streptonigrin was active at 4.0 ml/ ml for RS 321N. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents The CH2Cl2-soluble part of MeOH extract of pow- dered leaves of P. aduncum (24.0 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane con- taining increasing volumes of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 46 fractions (A1±A46). Fraction A3 (961.5 mg) was applied to a silica gel column (2.5 g) 230±400 mesh, eluted with hexane containing increasing concen- trations of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 14 fractions (B1±B14). Fraction B2 aorded compound 2 (13.0 mg). Fraction A4 (218.0 mg) was chromatographed via silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 10 fractions (C1±C10). Fraction C5 (133.0 mg) yielded pure com- pound 3 (23.0 mg). Fraction A5 was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give ner- olidol (180 mg). Fraction A11 (675.6 mg) yielded the pure compound 4 (171 mg). Fraction A13 (980.0 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 90%) to give the compound 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'- methoxydihydrochalcone (408.0 mg). Fraction A14, a green gum (25.0 mg), was further puri®ed by reversed- phase HPLC, as described in the general experimental procedures, to give 5 (12.3 mg). The dried and pow- dered leaves (1.003 g) of P. aduncum were extracted D. Cristina Baldoqui et al. / Phytochemistry 51 (1999) 899±902 901 with EtOAc (®ve times, 150 ml each). The resulting extract (325.6 mg) was dissolved in CHCl3 and parti- tioned with an aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (six times, 50 ml each). The aqueous fraction was neutral- ized with HCl (6 N) and submitted to partition with EtOAc (three times, 100 ml each) to give a residue (248.0 mg). This fraction (248.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC eluted with CHCl3:MeOH (98:2) and HOAc (1%) to give 12.0 mg of compound 1. 2,2-Dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1): amorphous solid; UV (MeOH) lmax (log E ): 240 nm (1.9); IR nmax (KBr): 2400±3400, 3010, 2920, 2870, 1680, 1610, 1485, 1440, 1135 cmÿ1; ES±MS m/z (rel int): 205 [M+1] (100); 1H and 13C NMR, see Table 1. 3-(3',7'-Dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (5): amorphous solid; UV (MeOH) lmax (log E): 254 nm (3.8); IR nmax (KBr): 2400±3400, 3005, 1680, 1640, 1600, 1488, 1445, 1130 cmÿ1; ES±MS m/z (rel int): 303 [M+1] (100); 1H and 13C NMR, see Table 1.

A literature analysis pointed out its importance as a source of prenylated bioactive molecules. The screening performed on aromatic acceptors (benzoic acids, phenols and phenylpropanoids) including geranyl diphosphate as prenyl donor, showed the biotransfor- mation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid by the crude extract, and the p-hydroxybenzoic acid by both the microsomal fraction and the crude extract, after treating leaves with glucose. The analysis of the products allowed the identiﬁcation of C- and O-geranylated derivatives, and the protease (subtilisin and pepsin) inhibition performed on the O-geranylated compounds showed weak inhibition. Electrophoretic proﬁles indicated the presence of bands/spots among 56–58 kDa and pI 6–7, which are compatible with pren- yltransferases. These ﬁndings show that P. crassinervium could be considered as a source of extracts with geranyltransferase activity to perform biotransformations on aromatic substrates. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

They are different from biosynthesis, where complex products are assembled from simple substrates by whole cells, organs or organisms. Plant enzyme biocatalysts can be uti- lized to introduce new structural motifs on existing drugs expect- ing to improve their bioactivity, pharmacokinetic proﬁle and also for the production of new drugs (Giri et al., 2001). So far, natural products bearing one or more prenyl groups have been isolated predominantly from higher plants. These com- pounds, originated from several natural product classes, often hold antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, antiviral, and anti- cancer activities (Epifano et al., 2008). Since the prenylation of small aromatic molecules is a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of many natural products, the access to prenylation reaction catalysts might represent an advantageous short-cut to obtain prenylated aromatic compounds (Yazaki et al., 2001; Haagena et al., 2007). Aromatic geranyltransferases are a sub-class of prenyltransfe- rases that catalyzes C-geranylations on several aromatic sub- strates. Several examples of new aromatic prenyltransferases have been reported from bacteria as soluble monomeric biocata- lysts, with a relatively high promiscuity for aromatic substrates. In spite of the lack of a full elucidation of substrate- and regio- speciﬁcity, these enzymes were successfully employed to carry out either C- or O-prenylations of several compounds (Epifano et al., 2008). In plants, aromatic geranyltransferases are mem- brane-bound proteins, showing a strict substrate speciﬁcity for the endogenous prenyl donor groups (e.g. DMAPP, GPP, etc.), although they may accept a variety of aromatic compounds as acceptors of the prenyl moieties (Yazaki et al., 2001; Kuzuyama et al., 2005). There are few examples in which prenyltransferases have been isolated and characterized from plants (Mühlenweg et al., 1998). Therefore, biotransformations using plant enzymatic extracts enriched in prenyltransferase activity could be used as an alternative to obtain either known or new bioactive compounds. Piperaceae family is a basal angiosperm family, comprising more than 4000 species. Its species are chemically very rich and major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Parmar et al., 1997; Bene- vides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003; Felippe et al., 2008), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alécio et al., 1998; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005).

Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Bioresource Technology journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/biortech family, Piper is one of the most abundant genera, with approxi- mately 2000 species (Wanke et al., 2007). Piper crassinervium spe- cies accumulates antifungal, trypanocidal and antioxidant C- geranylated metabolites derived from both benzoic acid and p- hydroquinone (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008). In spite of the knowledge on the chemical constituents and the biological potential of Piperaceae species, no comprehensive study has been made in order to survey such bioactive metabolites with- in the members of the family. Here we present a compilation that points out to the impor- tance of Piper genus as a source of bioactive compounds and, par- ticularly, of P. crassinervium as an enzyme source to perform geranylations on aromatic substrates. We report the biotransfor- mation (i.e. the geranylation) of both the p-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids carried out by the enzymatic extracts from the leaves of P. crassinervium besides the full characterization of two products as geranyl ester derivatives in addition to the char- acterization of one major product formed by biotransformation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a C-geranylated derivative. Addi- tionally, the inhibitory activity on HIV-like proteases was determined for the products as well as the electrophoretic charac- terization of catalytically active protein fractions by using SDS PAGE and 2-DE. 2. Methods 2.1. Literature survey and analysis ‘Piperaceae’ and ‘activity’ were used as key words to perform a search in the available databases (e.g. Science Direct and ACS dat- abases). All the obtained information was uploaded in a table according to genus, species, type of compound and biological activ- ity reported (see the Electronic Annex in the online version of this article). Typical software Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation) was used to analyse and plot the obtained information. 2.2. Plant material Fresh leaves of P. crassinervium were collected from adults spec- imens cultivated from seeds under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara, SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo-Peru) and the voucher specimen (Kato-0084) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Incubation into b-D-glucose of young leaves from P. crassiner- vium. Leaves freshly excised from an adult plant were placed sep- arately in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and each administrated 100 ll from a 10% solution of b-D-glucose in water at 25 C for 72 h (Berg- amo et al., 2005). 2.3. Synthesis and puriﬁcation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) In a 100 ml round bottom ﬂask 1 mmol of geraniol was mixed with 6 mmol of trichloroacetonitrile. Bis-triethylammonium phos- phate (2.4 mmol in 20 ml of acetonitrile) was added drop-wise to the mixture over a period of 6 h, at room temperature under con- tinuous stirring (Cornforth and Popják, 1969). The mixture was fur- ther stirred for 12 h at room temperature and then, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 100 ml of ethyl ether, followed by extraction with 30 ml of NH4OH 0.1 M (3). The basic solution was then re-extracted with 30 ml of ethyl ether (3) and evapo- rated under reduced pressure. The GPP was puriﬁed by precipita- tion in acetonitrile at 20 C overnight, compared with a commercial sample using TLC on cellulose (isopropanol/25% aque- ous ammonia/water 50:25:25) and characterized by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): d 4.44 (H-1, d, J = 7.0 Hz), 5.41 (H-2, t, J = 7.0 Hz), 2.02–2.15 (H-4 and H-5, m), 5.17 (H-6, m), 1.59 (–CH3 8, s), 1.65 (–CH3 9, s), 1.66 (–CH3 10, s). 13C NMR (125 MHz, D2O): d 63.0 (C-1), 124.3 (C-2), 143.0 (C-3), 46.9 (C-4), 25.8 (C-5), 120.0 (C- 6), 133.9 (C-7), 25.0 (C-8), 17.2 (C-9) and 15.8 (C-10). 31P NMR (H3PO4, 202 MHz, D2O): d 9.75 (P-1), 10.40 (P-2). 2.4. Synthesis, puriﬁcation and characterization of the O-geranyl derivatives of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid To a stirred solution of the 3,4-dihydroxibenzoic acid (2 mmol) in dry DMF (10 ml), anhydrous potassium carbonate (6 mmol) was added and the solution stirred for 30 min at 40 C under nitrogen atmosphere (Pisco et al., 2006). Geranyl bromide (4 mmol) was added drop-wise and the resulting mixture was heated and stirred at the same temperature for 8 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then poured into cold water (50 ml) added with 0.1% of HOAc, and extracted with CHCl3 (100 ml) and EtOAc (100 ml). The EtOAc layer was washed, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was submitted to column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230–400 mesh), iso- cratic elution with Hex–EtOAc (60:40)] yielding ﬁve fractions. Fraction 2 was characterized as compound 3, fraction 4 as com- pound 4 and fraction 5 as compound 5. The puriﬁed products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Fig. 4, Table 1). 2.5. Synthesis, puriﬁcation and characterization of the O-geranyl derivatives of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid The p-hydroxybenzoic acid (1 mmol) dissolved in 5 ml of THF was added to a slurry of 5 g of Al2O3 neutral in ether (1 ml) (Glü- senkamp and Büchi, 1986). The solvent was evaporated and gera- nyl bromide (3 mmol) in ether–hexane (30:70) was added. After stirring during 4 days, Al2O3 was ﬁltered off and washed with 1% HOAc in EtOAc. The combined organic layer was evaporated and the products were puriﬁed using column chromatography [Silica- gel 60 (230–400 mesh), gradient elution with Hex 100%, Hex– EtOAc (90:10; 80:20; 50:50)], yielding 7 fractions. From fraction 3 it was characterized the geranyl ester derivative (6), whereas the geranyl ether derivative (7) was puriﬁed from fraction 4 by subsequent column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230–400 mesh), isocratic elution with Hex–EtOAc (80:20)]. The puriﬁed products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Table 2, Fig. 5). 2.6. Protein extraction Leaves of P. crassinervium were harvested from an adult speci- men and maintained in liquid N2. The frozen leaves (10 g) were triturated in a mortar with addition of 35% polyvinylpolypyrroli- done (PVPP), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM ethylenedi- aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 30 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 8). The homogenate was stirred slowly by 15 min in ice bath, ﬁltered on gauze and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant (crude enzymatic extract), which was then submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis. 2.7. Microsomal fraction The protocol was performed according to Mühlenweg et al. (1998) with minimal modiﬁcations. The supernatant (20 ml) ob- tained as described in Section 2.6 was subjected to ultracentrifuga- 4252 S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 tion at 39,000 rpm for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 1 M KCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol, and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspen- sion was subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. The supernatant was discarded, and the tube was carefully rinsed with 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5). The pellet was then resuspended in 10 ml of 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 6.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 2 M KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 4 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammo- nium]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPSO), and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspension was ultracentrifuged as described above, and the desired proteins were recovered as supernatant, which was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (9.0 cm long, 1.0 cm i.d.), previously equilibrated with the 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1.5 mM CHAPSO, 2 mM DTT and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The eluate was submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis. 2.8. Protein determination The protein determination was performed by the Bradford modiﬁed method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard (Stoscheck, 1990). 2.9. Detection of the geranyltransferase activity The reaction mixture (100 ll) containing 100 mM KPi (pH 8.0), 10 mM of precursors, 10 mM GPP, 10 mM MgCl2 (or MnCl2) and 65 ll of the proteic extract was incubated under stirring for 60 min at 35 C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 5 ll of 6 M HCl and extracted with 150 ll of EtOAc. After vortex and centrifugation, the organic layer was evaporated, the residue dissolved in MeOH (100 ll) and analysed by HPLC–UV, using a Phenomenex GEMINI column (5 lm C18 110 Å, 250 4.6 mm) at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic condition (25 min) con- sisted of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous HOAc (30%), with detection at 254 and 280 nm. Injection volume: 50 ll. For each reaction, two negative controls, which consisted of: (1) enzymatic extract + buffer and (2) precursor + divalent cation + GPP + buffer, were carried out simultaneously. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. 2.10. Sodium dodecylsulphate–polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS– PAGE) The SDS PAGE was performed according to the supplier infor- mation (GE Healthcare). The 12% polyacrylamide gels were stained with AgNO3. The relative molecular mass (Mr) of denatured proteins was estimated using the LabImage 1D software cali- brated with low molecular weight standards (phosphorylase b, sericalbumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase and trypsin inhibi- tor, with 97.4, 66.2, 45.0, 31.0, 21.5 and 14.4 kDa, respectively). 2.11. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) The 2-DE with immobilized pH gradients (IPG-Dalt) was carried out according to the supplier information (GE Healthcare). The IPG strips (13 cm) were rehydrated for 14–18 h with sample pro- teins previously treated with the Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare) Table 1 1H NMR data (500 MHz, J = Hz, CDCl3), 13C NMR data (125 MHz, CDCl3) and gHMBC correlations observed for compounds 3–5.

First dimension iso- electric focusing (IEF) was carried out in an Ettan IPGphor II Man- ifold applying a manufacturer’s standard protocol. The second dimension was performed on a vertical (14 16 cm) 12% poly- acrylamide SDS gel, in a SE 600 Ruby System, 45 mA/gel and 600 V. Each gel was stained with silver according to the Silver Staining Protocol (Amersham Biosciences). 2.12. Inhibition of the protease activity 2.12.1. Reagents Pepsin was from porcine gastric mucous. Recombinant Type VIII Subtilisin Carlsberg, Arg-Glu-(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile- Val-Gln-Lys-(DABCYL)-Arg ﬂuorogenic substrate (EDANS-DABCYL) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) spectrophotometric grade, were from Sigma–Aldrich, São Paulo, Brazil. 2.12.2. Protease activity assay The assays were performed in triplicate. Compounds were dis- solved in DMSO and diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) for subtilisin and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.4) for pepsin, respec- tively. Warfarin and dicoumarol were used as positive controls (Thaisrivongs et al., 1994; Pochet et al., 2000). Samples and stan- dard inhibitors (1 lg/ml) were pre-incubated with subtilisin (37 nM) or pepsin (1.7 nM) for 1 h, and then transferred to a black opaque microplate to be tested. The substrate EDANS-DABCYL (2 lM) was prepared in the speciﬁc buffer for each protease. In the control assay only protease and substrate were used. Proteases were prepared in the day of the experiment and the tests were per- formed for each one separately. Readings were made using 360 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission) ﬁlters during 7 min, with 1 min intervals, at 37 C (Hirata et al., 2005). The ﬂuorescence intensity was used to calculate the % of inhibition as follows: %I ¼ 100 ½ðDFs=DFpÞ 100 where, DFs and DFp are the difference between the ﬁrst and last readings for the sample test and the control, respectively. Fluorescence bioassay data were collected with a multidetec- tion microplate reader Synergy™HT and analysed using the KC4 software (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) and Microsoft Windows XP. 3. Results and discussion Prenylation is a chemical or enzymatic addition of a hydropho- bic side chain to an accepting molecule (another terpenoid mole- cule, an aromatic compound, a protein, etc.). In particular, the prenylation of aromatic secondary metabolites plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of a wide range of molecules exerting valuable pharmacological effects. Several examples can be found in phylo- genetically different classes of living organisms, from bacteria across mammals to plants (Epifano et al., 2008). Phytochemical investigations carried out on Piper species have led to the isolation of many bioactive natural products. The analy- sis of the distribution of these bioactive compounds (by genus, type of compound and bioactivity) in the Piperaceae family was performed looking at, particularly, the importance of prenylated natural products within that universe. The search was performed using ‘Piperaceae’ and ‘activity’, as key words, in the available web databases. This search resulted in 656 entries (see the Elec- tronic Annex in the online version of this article), which were ana- lysed and discussed here. The analysis was performed considering the botanical classiﬁcation as provided in the publications. Regarding the distribution of bioactive compounds reported within genera, a predominance of Piper genus over Peperomia genus was observed, representing 83%. In spite of the large number of species belonging to Peperomia genus (about 1700 species ver- sus 2000 from Piper) (Wanke et al., 2007), it only contributes with 15% of the total reports published. Such differences can be ac- counted for the fact that Piper species have been more exhaustively Table 2 1H NMR data (500 MHz, J = Hz, CDCl3) for compounds 6 and 7. 13C NMR data (125 MHz, CDCl3) and gHMBC correlations for compound 6.

(for details see the Electronic Annex). 4254 S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 studied partially due to their wide occurrence and biomass avail- ability (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex). Among Piper genus, 44 species were subjected to phytochemical or bioactivity investigations, being P. cubeba the most intensively studied with near 8%, followed by P. longum and P. aduncum with 7%, P. methysticum and P. tuberculatum with 6%, P. sanctum, P. ni- grum and P. crassinervium with 5% (Fig. 1). Only nine studies with Peperomia species were found, with P. duclouxii (28%), P. dindygul- ensis (18%) and P. galioides (13%), being the three mentioned most frequently. Considering the type of compounds, they were grouped based on their structural characteristics, as follows: ALK (alkaloids and other substances bearing nitrogen), LG (lignans, neolignans and re- lated compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPPR (preny- lated benzopyrans), HQPR (prenylated hydroquinones), BPR (prenylated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (ﬂavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopyr- anes), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (steroids), CHX (cyclohexanic derivatives), KLN (kavalactones, pyr- ones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives), (Fig. 2A). Their distribution shows the prevalence of nitrogenated substances (ALK), lignoids (LG) and ﬂavonoids (FLV) in Piper spe- cies. Nevertheless some differences could be observed in Pepero- mia, where LG (lignoids) and BPPR (prenylated benzopyrans) were the most abundant (Fig. 2A). Regarding biological activities, the grouping was performed considering the biological target in order to simplify as follows: snc (involving activities related to central nervous system, such as sedative and relaxant), tryp (antiprotozoal activity against Try- panosoma, Plasmodium, Leishmania), cyt (cytotoxicity and related activities), atb (antimicrobial, such as antibacterial and antifungal), can (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more speciﬁcally targeted), insec (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti- mosquito or ant), aox (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), enz (inhibiroty activity against several enzymes), aai (anti-inﬂamma- tory activity), acoag (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), iger (allelophatic activity), photo (photo-protecting activity), cic (cicatrizing activity) and avir (antiviral activity). The obtained distribution shows that Piper genus is mostly related to antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities, followed by anti-inﬂam- matory and enzymatic inhibitory activities, while Peperomia ap- pears to be mostly related to cytotoxic and antiprotozoal activities. Only Pothomorphe genus showed some relationship with antiviral activity (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2. (A) Distribution by type of bioactive compounds reported by genera in Piperaceae family. ALK (substances bearing nitrogen at the molecule), LG (lignans, neolignans and related compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPPR (prenylated benzopyrans), HQPR (prenylated hydroquinones), BPR (prenylated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (ﬂavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopyrans), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (steroids), CHX (cyclohexanic derivatives), KLN (kavalactones, pyrones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives). (B) Distribution observed by biological activity groups for each genus reported: snc (related to central nervious system, such as sedative and relaxant), tryp (antiprotozoal activity against Trypanosoma, Plasmodium, Leishmania), cyt (cytotoxicity and related), atb (antimicrobial, such as antibacterial and antifungal), can (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more speciﬁcally targeted), insec (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti-mosquito or ant), aox (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), enz (inhibiroty activity against several enzymes), aai (anti- inﬂammatory activity), acoag (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), iger (allelophatic activity), photo (photo-protecting activity), cic (cicatrizing activity) and avir (antiviral activity) (for details see the Electronic Annex). S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 4255 About prenylated natural products, i.e., all the compounds bear- ing one or more prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moie- ties as substituents in their basic structures, open or cycled (BP, BPR, BPPR and HQPR), they could be found in Peperomia, Pothomor- phe and in Piper species (Fig. 2). In addition, they are mostly related to antimicrobial (atb), insecticidal (insec) and antioxidant activity (aox), being the prenylated benzoic acid derivatives (BPR) from Pi- per species, the group with the most biological activities reported (Fig. 3). The analysis for the occurrence of major secondary compounds pointed out that Piper species could be considered as an important source of prenylated compounds and thus a source for further studies of prenyltransferase activity. The two species P. crassinervi- um and P. aduncum accounted for 11% of the total number of spe- cies in which bioactive substances have been reported for this genus and can be considered good candidates for further investiga- tion on bioactive prenylated metabolites (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex). Considering the literature survey performed here as well as our previous experience on both bioactivity and biosynthetic studies of prenylated compounds from some Piper species, P. crassinervium was selected for further studies (Lopes et al., 2008). This species accumulates two C-geranylated metabolites derived from benzoic acid [4-hydroxy-3-E-(30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20,60-octadienyl)ben- zoic acid (1)] and from 1,4–benzenediol [(1,4-dihydroxy-2-E- (30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20,60-octadienyl)benzene (2)], which showed antifungal, antioxidant and trypanocidal activities (Fig. 1) (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008). A screening for the prenylation activity with the crude enzy- matic extract from fresh leaves of P. crassinervium plus geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as the prenyl donor, a divalent cation (MgCl2 or MnCl2) and several aromatic substrates (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phenol, p- hydroquinone, caffeic acid, o- and p-coumaric acids) was initially performed. Neither the p-hydroxybenzoic acid nor the p-hydroqui- none (the two theoretically natural precursors of compounds 1 and 2) was biotransformed, whilst the reaction with the 3,4-dihydroxy- benzoic acid led to the formation of products, as observed in the chromatographic proﬁle, suggesting a biotransformation reaction when compared with that of the negative control. The reaction was consistently reproducible and the product was analysed by HPLC–UV–MS showing an intense peak at tR: 13.1 min with kmax at 280 nm besides some minor compounds between tR: 7–9 min (Fig. 4). The fact that the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid could be bio- transformed is interesting because no prenylated natural products bearing a catechol moiety have been isolated from P. crassinervium previously. The characterization of the biotransformation products was performed by the analysis of their UV–Vis and MS or tandem MS–MS (ESI negative mode) spectra, as well as by comparison with synthetic compounds prepared for this purpose: the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid geranyl ester (compound 3), the 4-O-geranyl- 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound 4) and the 3-O-geranyl-4- hydroxybenzoic acid (compound 5) (Table 1). Regarding the minor products detected (chromatographic peaks detected at 254 nm with tR between 7 and 9 min), their mass (MS) spectra were investigated and compared to those of the synthetic compounds 3–5. This analysis and the comparison of the chro- matographic proﬁles, UV (Amax 258 and 295 nm) and MS spectra ([MH] = 289, [MC10H17] = 153 and [MC10H17CO2] = 109) with those of the negative controls (see Section 2.9) allowed the determination of the product eluted at tR: 8.6 min as the geranyl ester of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3) (Fig. 4). The compound eluted at tR: 13.1 min displayed a [MH] = 303, which under subsequent fragmentation by MS–MS, gave rise to the fragment ion m/z = 259, indicating the loss of a CO2 molecule (Fig. 4). Considering that the addition of one geranyl moiety to this aromatic core produces a molecule with MW = 290, an additional oxidation at the geranylic chain was suggested on the basis of the MW = 304 observed, compatible with additional 14 unities to the MW = 290. This suggestion was based on the observation of the oxidation pattern of the isolated metabolites 1 and 2, which have a carbonyl carbon at their geranyl moieties (Fig. 1). The posi- tion of the geranyl moiety could be proposed as a C- (at the aro- matic ring) instead of an O-substitution (at a phenol group), due to the lack of the fragment at m/z = 153 in the MS–MS spectrum (Fig. 4). The position of the oxidation at the geranyl moiety was as- sumed to be at C-50, due to the observation of the fragment ions at m/z = 203 and 159, which could result from a McLafferty-type rear- rangement (Fig. 4) (Grossert et al., 2006). Since plant prenyltransferases are mostly membrane-associated enzymes, an additional protocol on the crude extract was per- formed to obtain a microsomal fraction (Mühlenweg et al., 1998). The process was monitored by electrophoresis SDS PAGE and 2- DE, and the microsomal fraction was evaluated for its geranyl- transferase activity having p-hydroquinone, p-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids as aromatic acceptors. No prod- ucts were detected when p-hydroquinone and 3,4-dihydroxyben- zoic acid were used as substrates. Nevertheless, the analysis indicated that the p-hydroxybenzoic acid was biotransformed yielding a new product as a weak chromatographic peak (tR: 13.6 min), absent in the negative controls. The chromatographic proﬁle of the obtained product was compared with those of the endogenous (1) and synthetic (6 and 7, Table 2) compounds, sug- gesting that the product of this biotransformation could be an O- geranylated derivative (Fig. 5). Previous studies carried out by our research group with leaves of P. crassinervium have demonstrated that compounds 1 and 2 were biosynthesized de novo after incubation for three days with glucose (unpublished results). Consequently, a protocol of feeding glucose by pre-incubation of fresh leaves from P. crassinervium with a 10% aqueous solution was applied to enhance the expres- sion of the geranyltransferase activity. Subsequent to the enzymatic reaction, the synthesis of the ex- pected product was enhanced, being possible to identify it as the geranylic ester of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid 6 both in the crude extract and in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 5). This result is Fig. 3. Distribution of prenylated bioactive metabolites by genera within Pipera- ceae family.

(2007), we propose that it is the ester derivative instead of the ether, as reported. The expected chemical shift value for the CH2-10 at d observed in the 1H NMR, should be similar for the two derivatives 6 and 7 and, therefore this data should not be enough to distinguish which derivative was formed. Thus, further NMR experiments including analysis of the 13C NMR values and the gHMBC correlations were carried out. The observed differences in the substrate speciﬁcity, suggest the presence of, at least, two geranyltransferases in P. crassinervi- um. One of them was soluble and showed afﬁnity to the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid, while the second was concentrated in the microsomal fraction, recognizing the p-hydroxybenzoic acid as substrate and was inducible by glucose. The SDS PAGE and 2-DE analysis indicated the concentration of spots between pI 6–7 and 56–58 kDa in the microsomal fraction, which is in agreement with previous reports for geranyltransferases from plants (Fig. 6). The two enzymatically formed products were characterized as O-geranylated derivatives and were previously reported as syn- thetic compounds (Kubo et al., 2003). The production of esters in- stead of ethers or C-prenylated derivatives, as naturally occurs in plants, suggests that different conditions and environments could affect the prenylation outcome in crude and partly puriﬁed enzy- matic extracts. Besides, a C-geranylated derivative of the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid bearing a carbonyl group at C-50 could be proposed by the analysis of its MS–MS fragmentation data.

López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 observations are in agreement with previous reports based on bac- terial recombinant aromatic prenyltransferases (Haagena et al., 2007). In spite of the large number of data on phytochemistry and bio- activity on Piper species, no studies have been addressed to deter- mine their antiviral potential and the only exception involved the monotypic Pothomorphe umbellata (Fig. 3). The inhibition of viral proteases has indeed been demonstrated to be a good target to search new drugs for the treatment of several illnesses including AIDS. In this context, the investigation on some common proteases such as subtilisin and pepsin is considered as a useful screening for the discovery of potential inhibitors of retroviral proteases (Hirata et al., 2005). Compounds 3 and 6 were tested as inhibitors of sub- tilisin and pepsin using the ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology. Both compounds showed weak activity, being the ester 6 slightly more active than 3 showing 15% of inhibition at 1 lg/ml on pepsin and 14% on subtilisin (Table 3). Warfarin and dicoumarol were tested as positive controls. The HIV-like protease inhibitory potential reported for 3 and 6 is the ﬁrst approach to the determination of antiviral activity of this kind of compounds, and complements the range of biological activities previously reported, such as antifungal and antibacterial (Kubo et al., 2003; Nihei et al., 2004). 4. Conclusions Prenylation of aromatic compounds represents an important feature when the formation of bioactive compounds in plants is concerned. There are several examples in which different simple prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl, geranylgeranyl or polyterpenic unities are added to aromatic substrates rendering them with important biological properties. The literature survey indicated that among Piperaceae family, P. crassinervium species appeared as an impor- tant source of geranyltransferase activity looking at biotransforma- tions reactions. Between the two substrates evaluated, the p- hydroxybenzoic acid was O-geranylated, whilst the 3,4-dihydroxy- benzoic acid was both C- and O-geranylated. The O-geranylated products presented a weak protease inhibitory activity. The elec- trophoretic analysis performed on the microsomal fraction showed a typical prenyltransferase electrophoretic proﬁle (Mr 56–58 kDa, pI 6–7). This work contributes to the comprehensive study of biotrans- formation reactions with geranyl moieties using plant enzymatic extracts as an alternative strategy to the biocatalysis with puriﬁed enzymes.

Eleven acridone alkaloids were isolated from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. (Rutaceae), with eight of them being identiﬁed as potent and reversible inhibitors of cathepsin V (IC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 3.9 lM). Detailed mechanistic characterization of the effects of these compounds on the cathepsin V-cat- alyzed reaction showed clear competitive inhibition with respect to substrate, with dissociation con- stants (Ki) in the low micromolar range (2, Ki = 1.2 lM; 6, Ki = 1.0 lM; 7, Ki = 0.2 lM; and 11, Ki = 1.7 lM). Molecular modeling studies provided important insight into the structural basis for binding afﬁnity and enzyme inhibition. Experimental and computational approaches, including biological evalu- ation, mode of action assessment and modeling studies were successfully employed in the discovery of a small series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as competitive inhibitors of catV.

Introduction Cathepsins, also known as lysosomal cysteine peptidases, are members of the papain-like peptidase family, which are implicated in many pathological conditions. These enzymes have been inten- sively studied as valuable targets for drug discovery and develop- ment.1,2 Although the major role of cathepsins is related to the terminal protein degradation in lysosomes, it has been shown that these enzymes are also involved in other relevant biochemical pathways, acting at selective and controlled processes with speciﬁc functions associated to their restricted tissue localization.3 In addi- tion, evidence has indicated that cysteine cathepsins have speciﬁc intra- and extracellular functions, being involved in a number of diseases including cancer, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, autoim- mune disorders, and viral infections.4 Cathepsin V (CatV, EC 3.4.22.43) was identiﬁed as a lysosomal cysteine protease speciﬁcally expressed in thymus, testis and cor- neal epithelium.5–7 The in vivo role of cathepsin V has been associ- ated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation pathway in humans8 and, in pathological conditions, the enzyme has been considered as a potential diagnostic marker for colon tumors.6 The enzyme is also expressed in colorectal and breast carcinomas but not in normal colon or mammary tissue. It is believed that cathepsin V plays a role in cancer progression, thus becoming a valuable drug target for oncology.9 Moreover, cathep- sin V has been identiﬁed as having potent elastolytic activity expressed in activated macrophages and, together with the lysosomal cathepsins L, K, and S, has been implicated in atheroscle- rosis.10,11 Signiﬁcant progress has been made to elucidate the rela- tionship between cysteine cathepsins and several pathological states. For instance, cathepsins K and S have been validated as drug targets for the treatment of osteoporosis and immune disorders, respectively.4 Natural products have provided considerable value to the phar- maceutical industry over the past century. Natural products repre- sent a rich source of structural diversity and biological activities, providing many drugs and lead compounds for the treatment of a variety of human diseases successfully developed for the treat of human diseases in many therapeutic areas.12 Several natural products have been investigated for their inhib- itory effects on the catalytic activity of cathepsins.4,13–15 Acridone alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring nitrogen heterocyclic compounds that have shown a large spectrum of biological activi- ties, including antiparasitic,16–18 antiviral,19 and cytotoxic.18,20–22 In the present work we described the biological evaluation and type of inhibition studies for a series of acridone alkaloids as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. Molecular modeling and preliminary structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies were also performed to investigate the molecular basis underlying the binding afﬁnity and inhibitory potency of this series of naturally occurring compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst example 0968-0896/$ - see front matter 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bmc.2010.12.056 ⇑Corresponding author.

Expression and puriﬁcation of cathepsin V Recombinant human cathepsin V was produced using the Pichia pastoris expression system as previously described.7 The molar concentration of the enzyme was determined by active site titra- tion with E-64 following the conditions previously described.23 2.3. Kinetic measurements All commercially available chemicals and reagents were pur- chased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma and used without fur- ther puriﬁcation. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and diluted to the appropriate concentration prior to the assays. The inhibitors were screened against cathepsin V at an initial concentration of 25 lM. The in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments were carried out in tripli- cate (in 96-well black plates) as previously described.24 The ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 200 lL, kept under stirring. Each well contained 191 lL of a 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM dithioerythritol (DTE), 2 lL of 1 mM Z-Phe-Arg-MCA dissolved in DMSO, 5 lL of sample, and 32 nM of cathepsin V. The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE at 27 C, and then the reaction mixture was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The reactions were started by the addition of the ﬂuorogenic substrate 4-methyl- coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) and measurements were conduct using the Molecular Devices Spectra MAX GEMINI XS (excitation 355 nm, and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irre- versible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). The IC50 values were independently determined by making rate measurements for at least ﬁve inhibitor concentrations. The type of inhibition and Ki values were determined under the same experimental conditions for three different inhibitor concentra- tions at ﬁve varying substrate concentrations (6.4, 9.6, 13, 19, and 38 lM). All kinetic parameters were determined from the collected data by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. The values represent means ± SD of at least three individual experiments. 2.4. Molecular modeling The X-ray crystallographic data for catV in complex with APC-3316 (an irreversible vinyl sulfone inhibitor) used in docking simulations were retrieved from PDB (PDB ID, 1FH0). For the calcu- lations, hydrogen atoms were added in standard geometry, using the Biopolymer module as implemented in the SYBYL 8.0 package (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux workstations. The only exception was the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys25), which was deprotonated during docking simulations. The histidine, glutamine, and asparagine residues in the active binding site were manually checked for possible ﬂipped orientation, protonation, and tautomeric states with the Pymol 0.99 (DeLano Scientiﬁc, San Carlos, CA) side-chain wizard script. The active site was deﬁned incorporating all amino acid residues within a radius sphere of 6.0 Å centered on the bound ligand. Molecular modeling studies were carried out using the default parameters of FlexX (BioSolveIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany).25 The FlexX scoring func- tion was employed to select the representative pose for each com- pound of this series. Subsequently, the top-ranked conformations for each compound were submitted to the web-based interface DrugScoreONLINE to rescore the proposed binding mode.26,27 Finally, the individual ranks obtained from the consensus scoring were considered to establish a new rank order list where the top-ranked inhibitor were selected for visual inspection. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Biochemical evaluation and preliminary SAR studies As part of our ongoing research program aimed at discovering natural products as new potent inhibitors of cathepsins K, V, L, and S, we have screened a collection of 270 compounds, from which 111 were natural products isolated from Brazilian plants. The major classes evaluated in this study included cumarins, triter- penes, cinnamic acids, amides, lignans, ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, and limonoids. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation: % inhibition ¼ 100 ð1 Vi=V0Þ where Vi and V0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determi- nate in presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively. Among the compounds tested, the most promising results against the cathepsins were obtained for the alkaloid and ﬂavonoid derivatives, including a series of acridone alkaloids (1–11), which showed potent inhibitory activity against cathepsin V. The chemi- cal structures and corresponding IC50 values (concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V) for the set of compounds (1–11) are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, com- pound 7 is the most potent inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 1.2 lM. This is a valuable result since acridone alkaloids as catV inhibitors have not been described in the literature. In addition to compound 7, compounds 1–3, 6, 10, and 11 also showed sub- stantial inhibition with IC50 values in the range of 2.2–5.2 lM. Compounds 4 and 5 showed only moderate inhibition, with IC50 values of 25 and 10 lM, respectively. The isomeric tetracyclic sys- tem (compounds 8 and 9) also showed low inhibitory potency, with IC50 values of 48 and 44 lM, respectively. The most potent inhibitors of the series (2, 4–7, 10, and 11) were then selected for further kinetic studies for determination of the type of inhibition and dissociation constants (Ki). 3.2. Mechanism of inhibition In order to explore the mechanism of inhibition in more detail, we have determined Ki values (Table 1) and the type of inhibition with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA employing com- pounds 2, 4–7, 10, and 11. The results indicate that the inhibition of catV was found to be competitive with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (Fig. 1). The Lineweaver–Burk double-reciprocal plots show intercepts of all lines (obtained at three different inhibitor concentrations) converging at the y-axis (1/Vmax), whereas the slope (KM/Vmax) and x-axis intercepts (1/KM) vary with inhibitor concentration. Consequently, the Vmax values remain constant, whereas the apparent values of KM (Kapp M , deﬁned as KM(1 + [I]/Ki)) increase with increasing inhibitor concentrations. This behavior is consistent with a mutually exclusive binding mode between inhibitor and substrate, therefore, these inhibitors (2, 4–7, 10, and 11) compete with Z-Phe-Arg-MCA for the free enzyme ac- tive site. Another factor that must be considered in inhibitor drug design is the comparisons on the rational basis of the enzyme dis- sociation constant (Ki), since IC50 values can vary with substrate concentration for competitive inhibitors. The same data of Figure 1 was employed to determine the Ki values of the competitive inhibitors using Dixon plots, which consist in plotting the recipro- cal of the initial velocity (1/V0) versus a series of inhibitor concentrations at constant substrate concentrations, where the R. P. Severino et al. / Bioorg. Med. Chem. 19 (2011) 1477–1481 1479 lines converge above the x-axis, indicating the inhibition constant Ki. The Ki values for inhibitors 2, 4–7, 10, and 11 are listed in Table 1. Accordingly, the results conﬁrm the acridone alkaloid derivatives as a new class of competitive inhibitors of catV, with afﬁnity values in the low micromolar range. 3.3. Molecular modeling studies The integration of experimental and computational approaches has become a vital component of structure- and ligand-based ap- proaches.28–31 Despite the strong evidence that the acridone alka- loids bind to the active site of the enzyme, the kinetic data does not provide insights into the binding proﬁle of the inhibitors (in the substrate pocket of catV). Therefore, molecular modeling studies were carried out to complement the kinetic ﬁndings and to inves- tigate the mode of interaction of these inhibitors.30,31 To achieve this, the compounds of this series were docked into the active site of catV. Although a quantitative agreement between the model and experimental SAR data was not expected, the model provided rel- evant insights into the inhibitory activity of the acridone alkaloid derivatives. The best predicted orientation of the representative inhibitor of this series, compound 7 (Ki = 200 nM), within the catV binding pocket is depicted in Figure 2. It can be seen that the inhib- itor binds to the central region of the catV substrate binding site, close to the catalytic residues Cys25 and His159. The inhibitor interacts to the enzyme through a set of four hydrogen bonds: (i) the 1-hydroxyl substituent is positioned at the S1 pocket as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly23; (ii) the oxygen atom of the 2-methoxy substituent accepts a hydrogen bond from the NH2 side-chain of Gln19, which is part of the oxyanion hole in catV;10 (iii) the 5-hydroxyl substituent binds to the S2 pocket acting as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Leu157; and (iv) the 9-carbonyl group binds to the S3 pocket by accepting a hydrogen bond from the NH main-chain of Gly66. In addition to the polar contacts, non-polar interactions contribute to the orientation of 7 in the catV binding site. The 1-hydroxyl and 2,3,4-trimethoxy substituted rings form van der Waals contacts with the side-chains of Phe67 and Cys25, respectively. These ﬁndings are in agreement with our SAR data, which indicated that the presence of polar substitu- ents at R1 (2-position) and less bulky groups at R4 (8-position) are favorable for enhanced inhibitory activity. Moreover, this confor- mation also suggests a structural feature that might be involved in the preferential binding of the 2-methoxy derivatives at R1 (7) compared with the corresponding isoprenoid (1–3) or unsubstitut- ed derivatives (4–6; 8–10). According to the model, the Gln19 res- idue would represent a hydrogen-bonding site to interact with the inhibitor in order to incorporate selected molecules inside the binding cavity of the enzyme, thereby contributing to the im- proved afﬁnity of the inhibitor 7. This observation is supported by the ﬁnding that the S10 would play a major role in the design of inhibitors having improved potency and afﬁnity.10 4. Conclusion In this work, we described a new series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as potent inhibitors of the enzyme catV. The kinetic and type of inhibition studies revealed that the compounds of this class are reversible competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme with afﬁnity in the low micromolar range. The SAR and molecular modeling investigations indicated important molecular and struc- tural features underlying the inhibitory activity of this series.

Introduction The Rutaceae family is constituted of about 150 genera with more than 1500 terrestrial species, being considered source of alkaloids, coumarins, ﬂavonoids and limonoids [1]. Hortia is a Neotropical genus of Rutaceae that comprises 12 species, dis- tributed in South America from Panama to the state of São Paulo, Brazil, most of them occurring in the Amazonian region. Xylella fastidiosa a Gram-negative bacterium is transmitted by xylem-feeding leafhoppers (Homoptera, Cicadellidae), and colo- nizes the xylem of plants causing diseases on several economically important crops such as citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) in sweet orange, Pierce’s disease (PD) of grapevine and coffee leaf scorch (CLS) [2]. The generally accepted cause of the symptoms induced by X. fastidiosa is the occurrence of vascular occlusion inside the ves- sel leading to water stress. It was previously demonstrated that the bacterium is able to grow as a bioﬁlm, which could be an important factor for pathogenicity [2]. As part of our efforts to ﬁnd potential lead compounds as bactericidal against this economically impor- tant phytopathogenic bacterium, coumarins, ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivative, anacardic acid, triterpenes and limonoids isolated from Rutaceae, Meliaceae and Anacardiaceae plants were assayed against X. fastidiosa [2]. Triterpene deriva- tives were the most active, guyanin (1), odoratone, gedunin, and ∗Corresponding author. E-mail address: dmfs@power.ufscar.br (M.F.d.G.F. da Silva). azadiractin A showed MIC of 2.9, 2.3, 2.7, and >2.2 × 103 M, respectively. Rutaecarpin (2) and 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid also showed appreciable activity against X. fastidiosa, the MICs were 4.2 and 4.8 × 103 M, respec- tively [2]. Compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) were isolated from H. oreadica taproots [3,4]. The need for novel and more selective agents to treat proto- zoal diseases remains. The classic examples of these diseases are Chagas, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and malaria. African try- panosomiasis or sleeping sickness is caused by T. brucei rhodesiense (East to South Africa) and T. brucei gambiense (West and Central Africa). They affect about half a million people in sub-Saharan Africa and an estimated 60 million people are at risk of contracting dis- ease, which is fatal if untreated [5]. The chemotherapy of these diseases is inadequate due to problems of drugs resistance, vari- able efﬁcacy between strain or species of the causative organisms, toxicity, difﬁcult of administration or requirement of long course of administration [6]. Human malaria is responsible for consid- erable morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is caused by four species P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum. Of these four species P. falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of the 300–500 million episodes of malaria worldwide and accounts for 0.7–2.7 million annual deaths. In many endemic countries, malaria is responsible for economic stagnation, lowering the annual eco- nomic growth in some regions by up to 1.5% [7]. These factors increase the urgency of the search for novel agents to treat protozoal diseases. Highly oxygenated ﬂavones and dibenzoylmethanes have shown to be active in tested for in vitro activity against P. falciparum 0021-9673/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These promising results have stimu- lated us to test some 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid derivatives for activity against these parasites. Preliminary assay was performed on methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), which showed activity against both P. falciparum and T. brucei rhodesienses. However, compound 3 has been isolated from Hortia oreadica taproots in small amount, and then the MICs were not determined. Compounds 1–3 (Fig. 1) were isolated from H. oreadica taproots [3,4]. Furthermore, if it is assumed that it is possible to modify the chemical structure of compounds in order to improve activ- ity and selectivity on the above assays, phytochemical studies of other organs of H. oreadica deserve more attention. Thus, we have now examined the leaves of H. oreadica since they have never been investigated before. The leaves afforded the known limonoid guyanin (1), the alkaloids rutaecarpin (2) and dictamnine (6), the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4), together with the new E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4- carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) (Fig. 1). Generally, the conventional methods including silica gel, polyamide and reversed-phase liquid chromatography are often used to isolate pure products from H. oreadica, but they are tedious, time consuming and usually require multiple chromato- graphic steps [9–11]. Counter-current chromatography (CCC), a liquid–liquid partition chromatography method, has a track record of being a powerful tool in the preliminary stages of crude extract fractionation [12–15]. With the ability to attain high res- olution, modern CCC and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) instrumentation, such as HSCCC and fast-centrifugal parti- tion chromatography (FCPC), have signiﬁcant potential to develop new approaches in natural product drug discovery, speciﬁcally towards reducing the expensive and time-consuming steps to iso- late active constituents. Due to the lack of a solid stationary phase, CCC has no irreversible adsorption and, therefore, provides loss-less fractionation [16]. Since samples are simply partitioned between different solvents phases, there is 100% theoretical sample recov- ery. In crude plant extract fractionation this is particularly valuable because it minimizes the chances of losing the activity during frac- tionation. This beneﬁt of CCC allows researchers to address the issues of synergy between compounds to explain biological activ- ity in plants, without the need to address potential irreversible adsorption of active constituents to the solid stationary phase dur- ing fractionation [14,17]. Therefore, HSCCC was used for separation and puriﬁcation of compounds 1–6 from dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oreadica. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus The HSCCC instrument employed in the present study was man- ufactured by P.C. Inc., Potomac, MD 20854, USA. It contained a quadruple multilayer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The ˇ value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (ˇ = r/R, where r is the dis- tance from the coil to the holder, and R, the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis and the central shaft). The sample injection loop volume was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus was regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The ﬂow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, NY, USA) constant-ﬂow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector (Eyela, DC-1200); Liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spec- trometry (LC–APCI-MS/MS) data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography equipped with a PDA2996 photodi- ode array detection (DAD) system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaﬂow electro- spray probe; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): on a Bruker DRX 400 and 100 MHz with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal stan- dard; infrared (IR): Bomen-FT-IR; ultraviolet (UV): Varian 500 Scan UV–Vis (visible)-NIR (near infrared); gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS): low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument. For low-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (APCI-MS), a Micromass Quattro LC instrument was used, equipped with a “Z- spray” ion source. 2.2. Reagents All organic solvents used for HSCCC were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and for LC–APCI- MS/MS were HPLC grade purchased from J.T. Baker (Ecatepec, Mexico). Water puriﬁed (18 M<OMEGA>) by areverseosmosisMilli- V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 4277 Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for all solutions and dilutions. 2.3. Plant material The leaves of H. oreadica were collected in January 2001 in Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. The identiﬁcation was carried out by Dr. José Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, São Paulo University and vouchers are deposited in the Herbarium of the same department. 2.4. Preparation of crude sample The leaves (3.2 kg) of H. oreadica were dried carefully by forced air at 40 ◦C and reduced to powder. The powdered dried leaves were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH at room temperature three times. After the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (93.0 g), dichloromethane (161.0 g) and methanol (42.0 g). 2.5. Selection of two-phase solvent system Small amounts of dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. ore- adica were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the compounds allowed to partition between the two phases [18,19]. The distribution of the components between both phases of each the 5 solvents systems were analyzed by thin-layer chromatogra- phy (TLC) using 20 cm × 20 cm silica gel plates with a thickness of 0.20 mm (silica gel 60 F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), on which the crude extract was horizontally spotted. The solvent system used for the development of the TLC plates was hexane–ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v). The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with a solution of vanillin reagent (5 g of vanillin in 9 mL of methanol, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 and 3 drops of acetic acid) followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of compounds into each phase. The partition coefﬁcients were determined by GC–MS only for the best solvent system as follows: 0.5 mg of dichloromethane extract was added to a test tube, to which 5 mL of each phase of the two-phase solvent system was added. The test tube was shaken as above, and then the upper and lower phases were analyzed by GC–MS. The parti- tion coefﬁcients of three compounds in sample were determined according to the peak areas. 2.6. Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution The two-phase solvent system composed of hexane–ethanol– acetonitrile–water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separatory funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The upper phase and the lower phase were separated and degassed by sonication for 20 min shortly before use. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving the dichlorom- ethane extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v). 2.7. GC–MS analysis The partition coefﬁcient and HSCCC fractions were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph ﬁtted with a fused silica DB-5 (30 m × 0.32 mm I.D., 0.25 m ﬁlm thickness) capillary column with helium as the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The temperature was programmed initially at 100 ◦C for 1 min, and then increased with a rate of 10 ◦C min−1 to 250 ◦C, the latter main- tained for 30 min. The injection (1 L) was split and its temperature was 280 ◦C. The interface temperature was 250 ◦C. The chromato- graph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass-selective detector at 70 eV. 2.8. HSCCC separation The upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elution mode. First, the coiled column was entirely ﬁlled with the station- ary phase (lower phase). Then the apparatus was rotated forward at 800 rpm, while the mobile phase (upper phase) was pumped into the column in a tail to head direction at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min−1. The retention of stationary phase (SF) was 85% (SF = 0.85). After the mobile phase front emerged and the hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution con- taining 2.5 g of the dichloromethane extract was injected through the injection module at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min−1. A total of 34 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an automated fraction collector. However, with 24 fractions all compounds obtained have already eluted. 2.9. TLC analysis of fractions obtained by HSCCC All HSCCC fractions collected were monitored by TLC (20 cm × 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254) with hexane–ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v) as the developing solvent. Based on the TLC plates monitoring, all HSCCC fractions were combined into 8 analytically distinct fractions. Fractions 1–2 afforded 5,8- dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4, 0.240 g), fraction 3 furnished E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4- carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5, 0.045 g) and fraction 5 yielded methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6- propanoate (3), (0.148 g). Fraction 4 was ﬂash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with n-hexane–Me2CO (8:2) affording guyanin (1, 0.04 g). Fraction 6 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2–MeOH, 6:4) to give rutaecarpin (2, 0.11 g). Fractions 7–8 were puriﬁed as fraction 6 to yield dictamnine (6, 0.088 g). 2.10. LC–APCI-MS/MS LC–APCI-MS/MS data were acquired using a 3.0 mm × 30 mm, 3.5 m XTerra-MS C-18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively, each one supplemented with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid, TFA): 20% line B at the beginning then goes to 30% B and 30% C in 9 min; the column was then washed with 20% line B and 80% line C for 4 min and re-conditioned with 20% line B for 3 min; a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210–500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post UV-detector splitter was used to send only 0.3 mL min−1 to the ion source; nitrogen was used for nebulization (200 L h−1) and desolvation (785 L h−1); the corona discharge was set at 3.27 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 27 and 4 V respectively; argon (Ar) was used for the fragmentation experiments and the parent ions were accelerated using a collision energy ramp of 1–25 eV. For SRM experiments, the cone voltage was maintained using tune parameters previ- ously optimized for all compounds at 27 V, and two transitions were selected for each compound (Fig. 2): for 1, m/z 499 →397 (monitoring) and m/z 499 →343 (quantiﬁcation), using a collision energy (CE) of 20 eV; for compound 2, m/z 288 →244 (quantiﬁca- tion) and m/z 288 →169 (monitoring) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 3 m/z 307 →203 (monitoring) and m/z 307 →233 (quantiﬁcation) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 4 m/z 293 →201 (monitoring) and m/z 293 →233 (quantiﬁcation) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 5 m/z 4278 V.G.P.

The dwell time was 0.08 s, and the interscan delay was 0.1 s. The col- lision gas pressure (argon) was set at 1.35e−3 mbar for all experiments. 2.10.1. Software All MS data were acquired and processed using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, UK). 2.10.2. Calibration standard and analytical curves Stock solutions (1000 g mL−1) of compounds 1–6 were pre- pared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, HPLC grade, Ecatepec, Mexico). Working solutions were prepared at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 g mL−1 by diluting stock solutions. Calibration standards curves were obtained in triplicates. For each point of the analyt- ical curves, the worst value in comparison with the average was discarded. Calibration curves were obtained plotting concentration (g mL−1) in axis x per area below SRM peaks (arbitrary units) in axis y (average of three runs). 2.10.3. Sample preparation The dichloromethane extract (30 mg) was re-suspended in 3.0 mL of HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) in cen- trifuge tubes by vortex agitation (Phoenix AP56, Araraquara, SP Brazil) for 30 s at the maximum possible speed. The obtained solu- tion was ﬁltered (PTFE Millipore, São Paulo, Brazil, d. 25.0 mm and p. 0.20 m), and then diluted appropriately and used for quantiﬁ- cation of compounds 1–6 by LC–APCI-MS/MS. 2.11. Biological assays Stock solutions of the compounds, plus control drugs, were prepared at a concentration of 20 g mL−1 in dimethyl sulfox- ide (DMSO; Sigma, UK), and diluted to appropriate concentration prior to assays. IC50 values were calculated with MSXLFIT (IDBS, UK). 2.11.1. P. falciparum Chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 was maintained in human A+ erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, UK) sup- plemented with Albumax II at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. P. falciparum intraerythrocytic cultures were set up as above, with 1% ring stage parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit, in triplicate in 100 L of medium in 96 well, ﬂat-bottomed Microtest III tissue plates. Drugs were added in threefold dilution series and cultures incubated for a total of 48 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. After 24 h, {3H} hypoxanthine (0.2 mCi) was added to each well. At the end of the assay, plates were rapidly freezethawed, harvested using a Tomtec Mach III cell harvested (Tomtec, CT) onto a 96-well format ﬁltermat and Meltilex solid scintillant (both Wallac, Finland) added prior to reading in a Microbeta 1450 scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland) at 1 min per well. 2.11.2. T. brucei rhodesiense T. brucei rhodesiense STIB900 blood stream form trypomastigotes were maintained in HMI-18 medium, with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HarlanSeraLab, UK) at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2–air mixture. Prior to drugging, trypomastigotes were washed and re-suspended in fresh medium at a concentration 2 × 105 mL−1, and 100 L of this suspension was added to the drug dilutions. The top concentration for the test compounds was 30 g mL−1. Pentamidine was included as the standard drug. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4–5 h on Gemini ﬂuorescent plate reader (Soﬁmax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a ﬁlter cut-off at 550 nm. 2.11.3. Cytotoxicity assays 96-well plates were seeded with KB cells at a concentration of 2 × 104 mL−1 (100 L per well). Drugs at 300, 30, 3 and 0.3 g mL−1 were added in fresh overlay after 24 h, in triplicate at each con- centration. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4–5 h on Gemini ﬂuorescent plate reader (Soﬁmax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a ﬁlter cut-off at 550 nm.

Results and discussion 3.1. LC–APCI-MS/MS In an attempt to establish a suitable method for quantiﬁcation of compounds in dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oread- ica, this was analyzed by HPLC–APCI-MS/MS using the SRM mode. The content of compounds in the crude extracts is important to determine their recovery in HSCCC analyses. The mobile phase was determined after testing different compositions of solvents. A good chromatographic resolution was achieved using a 9 min gradient, beginning with 20% acetonitrile then going to 30% acetonitrile and 30% methanol. This mobile phase provided both excellent separa- tion between all six compounds and good ionization levels under the APCI ion source. The SRM transitions were chosen on the basis of the stability of product ions obtained under collision-induced dis- sociation (CID)-MS/MS. The second-generation product ion spectra of compounds 1–6 showed intense protonated molecules ([M + H+]) at m/z 499, 288, 307, 293, 313 (m/z 313 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the protonated molecular ion m/z 359), and 200 respec- tively. The product ions chosen to form the transitions in SRM Table 1 Concentration of compounds 1–6 quantiﬁed simultaneously by LC–APCI-MS/MS in dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oreadicaa.

Regression analysis of the least-square line for data acquired from the external stan- dard calibration curves showed good linearity at a 0.01–1.0 g mL−1 concentration range of six compounds, with a correlation coef- ﬁcient above 0.997 for all curves. The content of guyanin (1), rutaecarpin (2), methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1- benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1- benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4), E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy- 4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5), and dictamnine (6) in the crude extract were 2.42%, 4.80%, 5.78%, 9.82%, 1.80%, 4.15%, respectively, and showed RSD ranging from 0.03 to 2.11%, as deter- mined by HPLC–APCI-MS/MS (Table 1). 3.2. CCC solvent system The essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvents. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. However, this is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent. For efﬁcient separation, it is important that the partition coefﬁcient (K) of the target compounds should lie in the range 0.5 < K < 2.0, and the separation factor between any two components (˛ = k2/k1, k2 > k1) should be greater than 1.5. A smaller K value results in a loss of peak resolution, while a larger value produces excessive band broaden- ing. To ensure a satisfactory retention of the stationary phase, the settling time of the solvent system should be shorter than 30 s. In order to avoid wastage of solvent, it is recommended that the two-phase system under consideration produces similar volumes of each phase [20]. It is also essential to consult solvent systems used in countercurrent chromatography that can be found in the specialised literature, e.g. [18,21–23]. Various techniques can be used for analysis of the best solvent system. Thin-layer chromatography is a very rapid way of guiding method development. A small amount of the sample is thoroughly mixed in a vial with equal volumes of the upper and lower phases of the chosen solvent system. The same volume of each phase is applied to a TLC plate which is then allowed to migrate in the 4280 V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 Fig. 4. Mass spectra of compounds 3 (A), 4 (B) and 5 (C), (GC–MS, 70 eV). organic phase of the two-phase solvent system. An optimal sys- tem gives an equal distribution between the two phases and Rf values of the sample components between 0.2 and 0.5. If the sam- ple is found almost exclusively in one phase, the solvent system is obviously of no use. It should be noted that the Rf value gives only an approximate indication of the appropriateness of a par- ticular solvent because TLC involves both partition and adsorption mechanisms, whereas CCC is based on purely liquid–liquid partition phenomena [20]. The following polar two-phase solvent systems were tested: chloroform–methanol–water (5:4:3, v/v), dichloromethane–meth- anol–water (4:5:3, v/v), hexane–ethanol–acetonitrile–water (10:8: 1:1, v/v), hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (3:7:5:5, v/v), hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (1:1:1:1, v/v), hexane– ethyl acetate–methanol–water (5:5:4:5, v/v), hexane–ethanol– methanol–water(10:7:10:8,v/v),hexane–ethanol–methanol–water (10:10:9:11, v/v), and hexane–chloroform–methanol–water (3:6:3:2, v/v). Out of the 9 candidate biphasic solvent systems, 4 were rejected, as the settling times were either too long, emulsions were formed when extract was added, or suitable partitioning did not occur. The remaining 5 solvent systems gave reasonable sepa- ration on TLC, however, only hexane–ethanol–acetonitrile–water (10:8:1:1, v/v) showed similar distribution among the two phases with the Rf values approximately 0.3 between the components, and therefore it was used for the CCC separation. The partition coefﬁcients determined by GC–MS with this solvent system for compounds 3–5 obtained in one-step separation were 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1, respectively. 5,8-Dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran- 6-propanoic acid (4) was obtained in a pure form at tubes 1–11, E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) at tubes 12–14, and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3) at tubes 20–22. The GC–MS of these compounds was shown in Fig. 4. The recovery of com- pounds 3–5 of 2.5 g of crude extract in a one-step separation were 102.5%, 101.2%, 99.0% (Table 1), respectively, which were determined by comparison with HPLC–APCI-MS/MS data. Guyanin (1) was obtained after column chromatography on silica gel, rutae- carpin (2) and dictamnine (6) on Sephadex LH-20, however, their recoveries were also excellent 66.2%, 93.1% and 84.9% (Table 1), respectively. 3.3. The structural Identiﬁcation of the compounds The structures of isolated compounds were identiﬁed on the basis of spectral data, particularly 1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, and APCI-MS/MS, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spec- trum with those from the literature. Compounds 1 and 2 have previously been isolated from Hortia regia [24], 3 and 4 from H. colombiana [25] and dictamnine (6) from H. longifolia [26] (Fig. 1). The new compound E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbo methoxyphenyl) cinnamic acid was identiﬁed as 5 (Fig. 1) on the basis of the following data: Amorphous white solid.

The ion at m/z 312 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the molecular ion. It is the ﬁrst report of this compound in litera- ture. 3.4. Effect of isolated compounds on P. falciparum, T. brucei rhodesienses and KB cells Compound 3 was assayed again and showed IC50 of 23.6 M against P. falciparum and IC50 of 15.6 M against T. brucei rhodesienses. An assay with KB cells has been also devel- oped in order to compare in vitro toxicity of dihydrocinnamic V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 4281 acid with the selective action on the parasites, and 3 was not toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 M). The 2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acids represent a novel class of compounds tested for the ﬁrst time as antimalarial and try- panocidal agents. Unfortunately, the other compounds showed no appreciable activity against P. falciparum and T. brucei rhode- sienses (IC50 > 100 M). Activity appears to be associated with a methyl ester function, since E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy- 4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid 5 and 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid 4 were inactive against both protozoan. Thus, in order to ﬁnd potential lead com- pounds, derivatives 4 and 5 will be converted in methyl ester and assayed again. 4. Conclusion Compounds 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6- propanoic acid (4), E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbomet hoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3) were obtained in one-step HSCCC separation. The one-step separation was more rapid (1 h and 20 min) and less solvents consuming, while conven- tional methods of CC for separation of guyanin (1), rutaecarpin (2) and dictamnine (6) from HSCCC fraction 4, 6 and 7–8 (respectively) were rather time consuming. Fraction 4 was ﬂash chromatographed on silica gel and compound 1 was obtained with more work- ing time (12 h). Fractions 6 and 7–8 were applied to Sephadex LH-20 ant took less working time (4 h). The present LC–APCI- MS/MS method was successfully applied to the quantiﬁcation of all six compounds from the crude extracts, and permit- ted to determine the recovery of compounds 1–6 in HSCCC analyses, which were excellent. The present study proved that HSCCC is a powerful technique for the isolation in one-step of compounds 3–5 from plant crude extracts for bioactivity stud- ies. The biological result indicated that the compound tested was active at concentrations in the micromolar range, while the con- trols chloroquine (IC50 3.0 nM, P. falciparum) and pentamidine (IC50 35 nM, T. brucei) were active in the nanomolar range under the same test conditions. However, if it is assumed that the IC50 required for continued investigation is <30 M, the IC50 of compound 3 is meaningful. Chemical transformation of the limonoid guyanin (1, 40 mg) and alkaloid rutaecarpin (2, 110 mg) is in progress and perhaps could improve their antibacterial activity against X. fastidiosa.

Introduction Coumarins constitute an important class of natural compounds with widespread distribution and exhibit a wide range of activity. Every year a large number of coumarins, having varied substitution patterns, are isolated from nature [1]. Xanthyletin (1, Fig. 1) is a coumarin isolated from Citrus species. Several biological activities, such as anti-tumor and anti-bacterial activities and inhibition of the symbiotic fungus cultivated by leaf-cutting ants [2–4] have been associated with this compound. Leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores in the tropics, can be found from the Southern USA to Northern Argentina [5]. Leaf- cutting ants are known to be a serious pest for agriculture due to the high amounts of vegetal matter from crops used by them in order to cultivate a symbiotic fungus on which they rely for food and enzymes [6,7]. The mutualism between the fungus and the ants is a point to be explored when alternative methods of con- trol are being thought of. Several compounds have been used for the control of these ants as organophosphorus, pyrethroids and sulﬂuramid insecticides [3]. Consequently, an extensive search for alternate methods to control these insects has been made in an attempt to substitute traditional agrochemicals by high speciﬁcity and, therefore, causing less damage to the environment. ∗Corresponding author.

The preparative isolation and puriﬁcation of xanthyletin from plant materials by conventional methods such as column chro- matography has been reported previously [4]. But the method is tedious and requires multiple chromatography steps. The counter- current chromatography technique has been widely used today in the isolation of natural products, and it is a form of liquid–liquid par- tition without the use of adsorbents, using two or more immiscible liquids, which are the mobile phase and the other the stationary phase. It eliminates irreversible absorptive loss of samples onto the solid support matrix used in conventional chromatography. The technique allows complete recovery of the sample, and is suitable for separations in the gram range [8]. This study reports the isolation of xanthyletin using high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) for the ﬁrst time. The optimum conditions were obtained for xanthyletin isolation with the purity at over 99%. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus The HSCCC system employed in the present study was a P.C. Inc. (Potomac, MD, USA) instrument equipped with a quadruple multi- layer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The ˇ value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (ˇ = r/R, where r is the distance from the coil to the holder, and R, the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis 0021-9673/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Structures of coumarins isolated from crude extract of the Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limonia roots: xanthyletin (1), suberosin (2), seselin (3) and xan- thoxyletin (4). and the central shaft). The loop volume of the sample injection was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus can be regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The ﬂow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, New York, USA) constant-ﬂow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector DC-1200 (Eyela, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Gas chromatography and mass spectra (GC–MS) were per- formed in a Shimadzu GC-17A (Tokyo, Japan) instrument coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 (EIMS) system. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were performed using two Shimadzu pumps (LC-10AD and LC-10 Advp) and an SPD-M10Avp UV detector set at 205 nm. HPLC-grade sol- vents were obtained from Mallinckrodt, and H2O was puriﬁed in a Milli-Q system. LC-UV-electrospray ionization (ESI) MS/MS data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatog- raphy equipped with a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) PDA2996 photodiode array detection (DAD) system; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaﬂow electrospray probe. For NMR, Bruker (Rheinstetten, Germany) DRX 400 and ARX 200 instruments were used; for UV a Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) 500 Scan UV–vis–near infrared (NIR) system and for IR a Bomen-FT/IR (Quebec, Canada) instrument. 2.2. Reagents and plant materials All the solvents used for preparation of crude sample and HSCCC separation were of analytical grade (Quimis) and the water used was distilled water. The root of Citrus sinensis grafted on Citrus limonia were collected in Estac¸ ão Experimental de Cit- ricultura do Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, Cordeirópolis, Brazil. 2.3. Preparation of crude extract The roots (467 g) of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia were dried carefully by forced air at 40 ◦C and reduced to powder. The pow- dered dried root was extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH at room temperature for 3 times. After the evapora- tion of the solvents under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (5.7 g), dichloromethane (7.6 g) and methanol (17.6 g). 2.4. Selection of two-phase solvent system Small amounts of crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the com- pounds allowed to partition between the two phases [9,10]. In order to determine partition coefﬁcient value K′ of approximately 1, the distribution of the components between both phases of 11 solvents system tested was determined by silica gel thin-layer chromatog- raphy (TLC) (20 cm × 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254nm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as the eluting solvent. The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with solution acid of vanillin followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of the xanthyletin. 2.5. Choice of the mobile phase In the choice of the mobile phase, small amounts of crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia were applied on silica gel TLC and it was developed with the water-saturated organic layer (i.e., upper organic phase) as the eluting solvent. 2.6. Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution The two-phase solvent system composed of hex- ane/ethanol/acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separator funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The two phases were separated and degassed by sonication prior to use. The sample solution was prepared by dissolving the crude extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v) of the solvent system used for HSCCC separation. 2.7. HSCCC separation The upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elu- tion mode. In each separation, the multilayer-coiled column was ﬁrst ﬁlled entirely with the stationary phase. The mobile phase was then pumped into the tail end of the inlet column at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL/min, while the apparatus was rotated at 850 rpm. After the mobile phase front emerged and hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution containing 1.2 g of the crude extract was injected. 2.8. HPLC analysis and identiﬁcation of HSCCC peak fractions The crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia and each peak fraction from HSCCC separation were analyzed by HPLC. Anal- ysis of coumarins in the crude sample and each peak fraction from HSCCC was performed on a C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm I.D., 5 m); ﬂow rate 0.8 mL/min; detection wavelength, 220 and 270 nm. The mobile phase composed of MeOH:H2O (6:4) was eluted at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min and the efﬂuent was monitored at 220 and 270 nm. The retention time was compared with that of standard of each coumarin. LC-UV-ESI-MS/MS data were obtained using a 250 mm × 4.60 mm, 5 m Luna Phenyl-Hexyl column (Phe- nomenex, CA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively): 40% line B at the beginning then goes to 50% B and 20% C in 10 min and stay so for 17 min; the column was then washed with 100% line C for 2 min and re-conditioned with 35 line B for 8 min; a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210–500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post column splitter was used to C.d.M.

Analyses GC–MS GC–MS was performed in a 30 m × 0.2 mm DB-5 capillary col- umn. The mass spectrometer was set to scan 40–650 m/z with an ionizing voltage at 70 eV. Samples were injected (1 L) with a split- ting ratio of 1:20 and the injector temperature was set to 250 ◦C. A continuous ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min of chromatographic grade helium was used. The column oven was initially at 120 ◦C and was held for 1 min after injection, followed by temperature ramping at 10 ◦C/min up to 250 ◦C, hold for 10 min. The total run time was approximately 24 min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Optimization of HSCCC conditions, choice of CCC solvent systems and mobile phase The essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvent. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. Hence, it is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent [9,11–15]. Several techniques can be used to obtain the best solvent system and TLC is a very rapid way of guiding method development. The polar two-phase solvent systems tested for HSCCC obtain- ing xanthyletin are presented in Table 1. Among those the hexane/ethanol/acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) gave the best partition coefﬁcient value, as well as it presented no emulsion for- mation and the time for phase separation was short (Table 1) for crude extract and pure xanthyletin and therefore was used for the HSCCC separation. The choice of the mobile phase has been done by TLC. The rapid TLC method to choice of two-phase aqueous sol- vent systems is the most applicable to the separations of a given extract [12]. If the RF values of the compounds to be separated are higher than about 0.5 (less polar solutes (RF < 0.5) the more polar layer should be used as the mobile phase. However, the organic phase was used as mobile phase because RF values of the com- pounds to be separated are higher than about 0.5 and it facilitates the evaporation of solvent from the collected fractions. Several additional CCC optimization parameters were examined, i.e., number of columns, ﬂow rates, volume of fractions collected, sample volume and mass injected and rotation speed. The num- ber of columns had inﬂuenced on the separation and purity of the outcome sample. When the separation was conducted for four coumarins employing 2 and 3 columns, poor separation occurred. On the other hand, when 4 columns were used, good separation results and acceptable separation time could be obtained. Besides the recovered sample had higher purity for each coumarin studied. The best ﬂow tested was 3 mL/min and 800 rpm. 3.2. Isolation of xanthyletin, suberosin, seselin and xanthoxyletin A total of 100 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an auto- mated fraction collector. The collected fractions were monitored by TLC. The fractions 36-41, 47-53, 55-63, 71-94 contained, suberosin 2, 30.8 mg, 93% purity), seselin (3, 17 mg, 86.9% purity), xan- thoxyletin (4, 36,4 mg, 89.5% purity), and xanthyletin (1, 128.5 mg, 90% purity) respectively. The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. The difference between suberosin and the other coumarins is the existence of a dimethylallyl group in the molecule. This group confers lower polarity to the suberosin when compared with the other coumarins under study. As such, this compound is the ﬁrst to be eluted in HSCCC analysis. The dimethylallyl group bonded to coumarin skeleton is able to cyclize with the phenol group, like the other coumarins, rendering them more planarity and with high interaction with aqueous phase. The structural difference between the seselin, xanthoxyletin and the xanthyletin is the presence of a methoxy group in the 5 position in xanthoxyletin of the angu- lar or linear pyrane ring in seselin and xanthyletin, respectively. The lipophilicity of seselin and xanthoxyletin when compared with xanthyletin can be justiﬁed by the presence of the methoxy group and angular ring. These differences in lipophilicity are responsible for the observed compounds’ elution. 3.3. HPLC and GC–MS analyses and identiﬁcation of the coumarins in HSCCC fractions Following preparative isolation and puriﬁcation by HSCCC, the collected fractions were analyzed by TLC, GC–MS and HPLC–MS to determine the relative purities of each fraction. Fig. 2 presents HPLC chromatograms of crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia and of xanthyletin, seselin and xanthoxyletin. Fig. 3A and B presents the mass and UV spectra of these compounds. Xan- thyletin was obtained with over 99% of purity after crystallization and 15.45 min retention time. The GC chromatography conﬁrms this purity. Seselin and xanthoxyletin were obtained in 70% and 57%, respectively and their retention times were 15.9 and 16.6 min, respectively (Fig. 2). Suberosin was analyzed ﬁrst by GC–MS and presented the purity of 93% (Fig. 4), but in the HPLC analysis (Fig. 5) it undergoes oxidation to a coumarin with 260 dalton. Further stud- ies have to be done to determine the structure, mechanism and reason for this transformation to occur. 4310 C.d.M. Cazal et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4307–4312 Fig. 2.

Identiﬁcation of the coumarins The identiﬁcation and structural elucidation of the xanthyletin, seselin, suberosin and xanthoxyletin were performed with UV spec- tra, IV spectra, GC–MS and HPLC–MS (Figs. 2–4), 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopic methods and by comparison with literature data [16–20].

Conclusion The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that HSCCC is a powerful technique for the isolation of xanthyletin, an inhibitor of leaf-cutting ant (Atta sexdens rubropilosa) symbiotic fungus (Leucoagaricus gongylophorus), as well as suberosin and xan- thoxyletin from root crude extract of graft of C. sinensis on C. limonia. High-speed counter-current chromatography, a support-free liq- uid partition chromatographic technique, eliminates irreversible adsorption of the sample onto the solid support, with economy of time and solvent. These results open the perspective for separation processes scaled-up seeking the application of xanthyletin in the control leaf-cutting ant.

The gingerols puriﬁcation was carried out in HPLC system using a Luna-C18 and the best mobile phase evaluated was MeOH/H2O (75:25, v/v). This new methodology for the gingerols isolation was very effective, since considerable amounts (in the range of milligrams) with a good purity degree (∼98%) were achieved in 30 min of chromatographic run. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol puriﬁed by this methodology inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 ± 134.6 M, 135.6 ± 22.6 M and 12.1 ± 0.3 M, respectively. These substances also inhibited human ﬁbroblasts (HF) cell proliferation, however in concentrations starting from 500 M. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an optimization of gingerols isolation and their speciﬁc anti-proliferative activities against tumor cells, suggesting their use as important models for drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Several population-based studies indicate that people in Asian countries have a much lower risk of different cancer types such as colon, gastrointestinal, prostate and breast, when compared to their Western counterparts. It is widely claimed that constituents of their diet such as ginger, garlic, soy, curcumin, onion, tomatoes, cru- ciferous vegetables, chillies, and green tea contribute to that lower incidence [1]. Therefore, there is increasing interest in naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive agents. Ginger (Zingiber ofﬁcinale Roscoe) is widely used worldwide as a food, spice and herb [2]. Together with [6]-gingerol, [8]- and [10]- gingerol are the major pungent constituents in the ginger oleoresin ∗Corresponding author.

Gin- gerols comprise a series of homologue substances differentiated by the length of their alkyl chains with [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol having 10, 12 and 14 carbons in their unbranched alkyl chains, respectively [3]. Regarding [6]-gingerol a variety of pharmacological charac- teristics was already described, including analgesic, antipyretic, cardiotonic, hypothermia inducing and cancer preventing effects [4–6]. However, the effects on tumor cell proliferation for [8]- and [10]-gingerol are still scarce. Breast cancer is the third most frequent cancer in the world and one of the most common malignant diseases in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the second highest cause of death in women after cervical cancer [7]. To treat breast and many other cancer types, chemotherapy is one of the most extensively studied methods. However, its efﬁcacy and safety remain a primary con- cern as well as its toxicity and other side effects [8,9]. Another reason for concern regarding this method is the development of chemotherapy resistance, which is a major obstacle to the effec- tive treatment of many tumor types, including breast cancer [8]. Tumor cells are found to adopt multiple mechanisms to resist drugs, such as decreased uptake, and/or enhanced efﬂux and altered drug 1570-0232/$ – see front matter © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Alteration in drug targets, activation of detoxiﬁcation systems, enhanced DNA repair ability, and inhibition of apoptosis are also cancer cell strategies to resist against chemotherapy drugs [10]. Many anticancer therapies can temporarily stop tumor growth; it means that, in most cases, the effect is not permanent. In this way, there is a signiﬁcant need for new agents with low susceptibility to common drug resistance mechanisms in order to improve response rates and potentially prolong patient’s survival. Approximately 30% of the women diagnosed with early-stage disease progress to metastatic breast cancer. To these women, therapeutic options are still limited. Current recommendations for ﬁrst-line chemotherapy include anthracycline-based and taxanes treatments (paclitaxel and docetaxel) [8]. Taxanes – which are taxol derivatives that were ﬁrst described as microtubule stabilizing agents [11] and then had their antineoplasic effects conﬁrmed [12,13] – are the ﬁrst example of natural product derivatives used in antitumor therapy. Therefore, the search for new natural products that may be used as an addi- tional alternative to the chemotherapy in an attempt to develop more effective drugs with fewer side effects is of great interest [14]. Based on this assumption it is important to develop an effective method for the isolation of these compounds. The aim of this work was to search a faster, efﬁcient and pro- ductive procedure for isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol by reverse phase HPLC operating under overloading conditions and to test their anti-proliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumor line and normal human ﬁbroblasts (HF), a non tumor cell line. The results presented in this study showed a more speciﬁc anti-proliferative activity for [8]- and [10]-gingerol against breast cancer compared to HF and suggest their use as important models for anti-cancer therapy in an attempt to develop new drugs with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol were isolated from the ethanol extract of the ginger rhizome (purchased locally) by liquid chro- matography. The structures were elucidated by 1H NMR using a Bruker DRX200 instrument (Bruker, USA), operating at 200 MHz for 1H spectra, with TMS as internal standard, GC–MS on a Shimadzu QP 5000 and comparison with literature data. The purity was deter- mined by elemental analysis on an EA 1108, CHNS-O (Fisons). HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from JTBaker Company (Netherland). Water was deionised. All other analytical grade reagents were from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation The fresh ginger rhizome was thin sliced, dried at 40 ◦C and ground to powder. The powder was extracted with ethanol for 72 h, three times. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 ◦C. The extraction of ginger (0.4 kg dry weight) yielded 21.2 g of crude extract (5.3%). The extract was stored at −4 ◦C for the later fractionation. In order to isolate [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, dry ginger rhizome crude ethanol extract was chromatographed on SiO2 (70–230 mesh) column with bed height 20 cm (20 cm × 8 cm i.d.), using initially n-hexane (1 L), to eliminate the lipids. After, n- hexane/ethyl acetate 50:50 (v/v, 2.5 L) was used as eluent resulting in 5 fractions (A1-5), where the fractions A1, A2, A3 and A4 (68.9%, 14.6 g), rich in [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerols, were joined resulting in the fraction A1–4. Part of this fraction (5.5 g) was re-chromatographed on SiO2 column (28 cm × 5 cm i.d.) using n-hexane/ethyl acetate 60:40 (v/v, 2.4 L). Forty eight fractions (50 mL each) were collected and combined after monitoring by TLC resulting in six sub-fractions with the following volumes: 250 mL (B1), 400 mL (B2), 150 mL (B3), 800 mL (B4), 200 mL (B5) and 600 mL (B6). The gingerols were the main constituent on the fraction B4 (800 mL, 2.8 g, yellow oil). Analytical and semi-preparative HPLC were carried out using a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP system with an SPD-10AVP UV–vis detec- tor with a ﬂow cell analytical or ﬂow cell preparative, according with the HPLC mode (analytical or semi-preparative), and a Shi- madzu LC-6AD pump. The isolation optimization was carried out on a Luna-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m, homemade, UFSCar, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) and the column was maintained at 25 ◦C, the detection wavelength was set at 282 nm and the ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phases consisted of isocratic binary mixtures (v/v) of MeOH/H2O (80:20; 75:25; 70:30) and ACN/H2O (67:33). Forty microlitres of methanol containing 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of B4 sample were injected. In the col- umn scale-up reverse phase semi-preparative, a Luna-C18 column (300 mm × 10 mm i.d., 10 m, homemade, UFSCar, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) was used. This column was maintained at 25 ◦C, the detec- tion wavelength was set at 254 nm (lower absorbance wavelength for the gingerols) and the ﬂow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The best mobile phase was MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v) and the scale-up factor was calculated using Eq. (1) below, where S, R, L, P, A are scale-up factor, column radius, column length, semi-preparative and ana- lytical columns, respectively. The maximum amount of fraction B4 injected in the semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg diluted to ﬁnal volume of 400 L. S = R2 PxLP R2 AxLA (1) 2.3. Cell line and culture MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor and HF cell lines, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), were maintained at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Cultilab – Campinas; SP, Brazil) containing 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum), penicillin (100 UI/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and l-glutamine (2 mM). Cell cultures and experiments were conducted in a humid- iﬁed environment with 5% CO2 at 37 ◦C. 2.4. Proliferation assays Cell lines were prepared at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/200 L, in appropriate medium with 10% of FBS, and plated on sterile 96-well plates for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14–18 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, known as starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation, the culture medium was removed from the wells and a new one, supplemented with 10% of FBS, containing different concentrations of the tested compounds was added to the wells. The cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h under the same conditions as described above. Cell proliferation assay was performed in comparison to the wells where the vehicle compound (2.5% DMSO) was added instead of the tested compounds. After incubation, the culture medium of each well was removed and a solution containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added (100 L/well). The plates were then kept at 37 ◦C for 4 h and the formed crystals were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. The absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 595 nm. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control for inhibition of cell proliferation [15]. J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 159 Fig. 1. Chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]-gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 80:20; MeOH/H2O 75:25, ACN/H2O 67:23 and MeOH/H2O 70:30, UV detection at 282 nm and ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 40 L. 2.5. Statistical analysis Each experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and a standard error mean was calculated. Shapiro–Wilk’s W test was used to verify data normality. As normal distribution was present, the results were compared statistically with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Since the ANOVA tests showed signiﬁcant differences (acceptable P level < 0.05), Bonferroni’s signiﬁcant dif- ference post hoc analyses were performed to determine differences between simple and grouped main-effect means, respectively. The data were analyzed by using Statistica software (version 8.0; Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, USA) and IC50 calculations were made using Hill’s equation in the Origin software (version 8.5; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). 3. Results 3.1. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation Four different conditions were carried out on analytical C18 column HPLC to achieve the best separation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol. The best separation condition was achieved using MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v), where a good separation of three gingerols in a single run of 30 min was obtained (Fig. 1). The injection volume (400 L) was larger than the usual size of an injection volume and also it was not the one that was calcu- lated by the scale up formula. This occurred because of the sample viscosity, which would be very high if 170.1 mg were diluted in 230 L (calculated volume) that would impair the chromatographic separation. For column overloading with the sample, increasing amounts of fraction B4 (0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg diluted to ﬁnal volume 40 L) were injected in a C18 analytical column. Using the detector at 282 nm electronic saturation was observed when 5 mg of sample was injected, although the peaks were still visible for isolation of gingerols until 15 mg. With the injection of 30 mg of sample, the electronic saturation hindered the visualization of peaks closer to peak 1 (Fig. 2). To solve this prob- lem, on the semi-preparative mode, the detector was set at 254 nm and in this condition it was possible to identify the three gingerols present in the fraction. Fig. 2. Overload chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]- gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale. The fraction was injected in a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 75:25, UV detection at 282 nm and ﬂow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The injected masses were 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. The injection volume was 40 L. Using Eq. (1) for the determination of scale-up factor, the value 5.67 was obtained, consequently the maximum amount of B4 frac- tion that could be injected in a semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg (Fig. 3). However, to make the adjustment of the ﬂow rate easier we decided to use 6.0 mL/min instead of 5.67 mL/min, and by working in this condition the results obtained were satisfactory. The mass of each gingerol obtained from 170.1 mg of fraction B4 was: 94 mg ([6]-gingerol), 22 mg ([8]-gingerol) and 17 mg ([10]- gingerol). The purity of gingerols was calculated based on the elemental analysis of each gingerol. The puriﬁcation yields based on the fresh ginger weight were 1027, 241 and 187 ppm for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. The purity obtained was 94.4, 99 and 97.3% for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. Fig. 3.

The fraction was injected in a C18 (300 mm × 10 mm i.d., 10 m) column maintained at 25 ◦C with MeOH/H2O 75:25, UV detection at 254 nm and ﬂow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The injected masses were 85.1 mg, 170.1 mg. The injection volume was 400 L. 160 J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 Fig. 4. Effects of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 and Human Fibroblasts cell proliferation. MDA-MB-231 tumor cells or Human Fibroblasts were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/200 L in a 96-well plate containing DMEM medium with 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum) for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14–18 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, named starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation the monolayers were incubated with different concentrations of [6]-, [8]- or [10]-gingerol in DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% of FBS. The cells were incubated for 24 (A) or 48 (B) hours. Viable cells were estimated by the MTT assay.

Effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol on normal and tumor cell proliferation The effects of isolated compounds, [6]-, [8]-, and [10]-gingerol, were compared to their effects on HF, a normal (non tumor) cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). In these assays, the controls were made by incubating the cells in a normal medium, supplemented with 10% of FBS (+FBS), in a medium without FBS (−FBS), adding DMSO (ﬁnal concentration of 2.5%) to the medium supplemented with 10% of FBS (DMSO) and ﬁnally, in doxorubicin (1.5 M), a compound used in breast cancer chemotherapy, as a positive control for cell proliferation inhibition [15]. The results showed that [8]-gingerol affects MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation after 24 h of incubation, with 500 and 1000 M inhibiting approximately 75% and 50% of tumor cell prolifera- tion, respectively (Fig. 4A and B). After 48 h of incubation with [8]-gingerol 100 M there was approximately 60% of MDA-MB- 231 cell proliferation inhibition (Fig. 4B). At the same incubation period with [8]-gingerol 500 and 1000 M, MDA-MB-231 inhibi- tion remained in a rate of 75% compared to control cells (+FBS). [8]-Gingerol 1, 10 and 50 M had no effects on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation (Fig. 4A and B). Fig. 5. Differential effects of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 M on MDA-MB- 231 and Human Fibroblasts cell proliferation after 48 h of incubation. Results are mean ± SD of three independent assays in triplicate (a = MDA-MB-231 vs. HF P < 0.01; b = MDA-MB-231 vs. HF P < 0.001). J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 161 For [10]-gingerol, a concentration of 100 M was signiﬁcantly effective in inhibiting MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at 24 h of incubation in a rate of 75%, compared to cells seeded on normal medium (+FBS). The same pattern was observed after 48 h of [10]- gingerol incubation; there was a cell proliferation inhibition of about 90% (Fig. 4B). HF were used in order to compare the effects of both [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in a non tumor cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). No signiﬁcant differences in MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation using 1, 10, 50 and 100 M for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in 24 or 48 h of incubation were veriﬁed. However, 500 and 1000 M concentra- tions were effective in this inhibition, but in an approximate rate of only 50% (Fig. 4A and B). The differential effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 M after 48 h of incubation with HF and MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line are demonstrated in Fig. 5. These compounds were more effective in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (MDA-MB-231) when compared to normal cell proliferation (HF). The IC50 values for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation were calculated. The results showed that these compounds inhibited the prolifera- tion of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 ± 134.6 M; 135.6 ± 22.6 M and 12.1 ± 0.3 M, respectively. These substances also inhibit HF cell proliferation, nevertheless, we were not able to calculate the IC50 values for this cell line, since the initial concen- tration that had an effect was 500 M for [6]-, [8] and [10]-gingerol. 4. Discussion Studies of isolation and puriﬁcation of gingerols are scarce in the literature. Considering the interesting biological activities and the potential of these compounds to the medical area it is imperative to develop new methodologies to achieve an optimization of gin- gerol separation and puriﬁcation. The isolation of gingerols ([6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol) described in this work was achieved satis- factorily, once it was possible to obtain relatively high mass and a good degree of gingerols purity. To our knowledge, only one work about isolation of gingerols using HPLC system was published [18]. In this work, the authors isolated the major gingerols from the crude dichloromethane extract of ginger rhizome by normal phase HPLC. A low purity degree (calculated by the percentage of peak area) for both, [8]-gingerol (86%) and [10]-gingerol (84%) was achieved, while for the [6]-gingerol the purity was 99%. The purity degree obtained for each gingerol does not represent the real one, because HPLC system using UV detection does not guarantee the absence of other components in the sample. In a recent work, the isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol was carried out using counter-current chromatography (CCC). In this study gingerols were obtained with high purity degree (99%), however the time of chromatographic run was very length (240 min) [19]. In another work regarding iso- lation of gingerols from crude extract of ginger rhizome using CCC the time of chromatographic run was again very extensive, and the purity was about 98% [20]. Electronic saturation is a factor that considerable limits the increasing of injected mass in the semi-preparative scale. In our work, this factor had limited injections of samples with higher masses, even at a wavelength of low absorption of gingerols (254 nm) (Fig. 3). However, the gingerols were isolated in sig- niﬁcant quantities and with a good purity degree. To avoid the electronic saturation we could use either a less sensitive ﬂow cell or make the adjustment of the wavelength well off the lambda max. We have not tried a less sensitive cell, however all the experiment conditions were tested in the lower absorption wavelength for the gingerols, and we still obtained electronic saturation. It may be possible to use other detectors even though we have only used UV. The effects of [6]-gingerol on tumor cell proliferation are already well documented [5,21–23], however, the effects of [8]- and [10]- gingerol on tumor cells are still scarce. In fact, among all the ginger constituents, much more attention has been given to [6]-gingerol in order to explore its pharmacological properties and action mech- anisms. In this sense, besides [6]-gingerol effects, those of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on in vitro tumor cell proliferation using MDA-MB- 231 and HF cell lines were also investigated. The overall results suggest that the higher the alkyl chain, the greater the effectiveness of gingerol in inhibiting tumor cell pro- liferation, probably due to the manner in which these substances enter the cells through their plasma membrane. In general, with increasing alkyl chain lengths, there is an increase in lipophilic character (log P) of compounds, and this can be quantiﬁed by the partition coefﬁcient (P) in an n-octanol/water system. It is also known that the higher the log P value, to a certain extent, the higher will be the permeation in biological membranes [24,25]. This can be extended to compounds such as gingerols, which represent a homologous series of substances. Similar effects of gingerols and other ginger-derived substances were already described in the literature. Tjendraputra et al. [26] demonstrated that the inhibition of COX-2 by ginger constituents and synthetic analogs was structure-dependent. The lipophilicity and the functional group substitution on the alkyl side chain, as well as the aromatic moiety were the main aspects inﬂuencing COX-2 inhibition. Similar correlations between the side-chain length of gingerols and their activities of apoptosis induction and neuronal cells protection from -amyloid insult have already been demon- strated [27,28]. The cytotoxic effect of [8]- and [10]-gingerol has been investi- gated by a few authors [27,29]. Kim and coworkers [29] have tested the effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol in a variety of human tumor cells lines including A-549 (lung cancer), SK-OV-3 (ovarian cancer), SK- MEL-2 (skin cancer) and HCT15 (colon cancer). They found an IC50 ranging from approximately 4.52 g/mL (13 M) to 12.57 g/mL (40 M), with [10]-gingerol being more effective than [8]-gingerol in decreasing the viability of these tumor cell lines [29]. Wei and coworkers [27] found an IC50 of 87.9 ± 3.5 M and 56.5 ± 6.0 M for [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively, in the inhibition of HL-60 proliferation, a human leukemia tumor cell line. These data are in accordance with the ﬁndings in this work on MDA-MB-231 cells, revealing the same activity dependence on the chain length size pattern. Kuo and collaborators [30] working with SW480 cells, a lin- eage of colorectal cancer, observed that [10]-gingerol caused a signiﬁcant concentration-dependent and sustained [Ca2+]i rise, suggesting that this elevation can alter cellular functions, leading to cell death. They found a cytotoxic effect of [10]-gingerol 50, 75 and 100 M [30]. It is important to notice that the methodology in the present study was different, even though, similar effects were found in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line. Our ﬁndings demonstrate a speciﬁcity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on the inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation when com- pared to non tumor human ﬁbroblast cell line. The ﬁndings of other authors corroborate with our results. Kazi et al. [31] described the effects of antibiotics derived from -lactam, lactam 1 and 12 on normal and tumor cells. They show that lactam 1 selectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat T, but not in the non transformed, immortalized human natural killer cells. Further- more, the authors demonstrated that lactam 12 induces apoptosis selectively in Jurkat T and simian virus 40-transformed, but not in non transformed NK and parental normal ﬁbroblast cells. The authors propose that these N-thiolated -lactams act by inducing DNA damage that leads to apoptosis preferentially in cancer and transformed over normal/non transformed cells. Another exam- ple includes pancratistatin, a natural compound isolated from the 162 J.A.d. Silva et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 903 (2012) 157– 162 spider lily, which is an efﬁcient inducer of apoptosis in human lymphoma (Jurkat) cells, with minimal effect on normal nucleated blood cells. The authors discuss that this selective effect could be due to the expression of the Fas receptors, which are found to be greater in blood lymphoma cells than normal blood cells. Further- more, in fast-dividing cancer cells, the plasma membrane tends to run short of lipids, perhaps changing the ﬂuidity of the membrane [32]. Ovadje et al. [33] demonstrate that dandelion root extract is capable of inducing apoptosis at low concentrations speciﬁcally in cancer cells with no toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, Mathen et al. [34] working with extracts from Calotropis gigantea, the giant milkweed, traditionally used for the treatment of cancer and in Ayurvedic medicine and Poecilocerus pic- tus, an orthopteran insect, which feeds on C. gigantea, demonstrated that both the insect and the plant extracts induce concentration- dependent apoptosis and differentiate between human cancer cells and normal cells and exhibit species speciﬁcity. The chemopreventive mechanisms of gingerols are not well understood however, are thought to involve proapoptotic [27,35–37], antioxidant [38], anti-inﬂammatory [6,39–41], and anti-angiogenic [42] activities. Further investigation will be done in order to determine the mechanisms by which [8]- and [10]- gingerol act inhibiting with more speciﬁcity the MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, this work presents a new methodology for the isolation of gingerols, which proved to be effective, once consid- erable amounts with a good purity degree in a relatively short time of chromatographic run were achieved from these important bioactive compounds, mainly [8]-gingerol (99%) and [10]-gingerol (97.3%). This is the ﬁrst report on the separation of these com- pounds with such a purity degree using HPLC semi-preparative scale. Optimizations in the separation process regarding column overloading can still be made so that the electron saturation be not reached, which can be achieved by using other less sensitive detec- tors. The gingerols isolated through this methodology, demonstrate an anti-proliferative activity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol speciﬁcally on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells when compared to HF normal cells. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst report regarding a speciﬁc cell effect of ginger derivatives. The results also suggest the use of [8]- and [10]-gingerol as important models for anti-cancer therapy and drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.

Introduction Although Coussarea is considered to be only a small genus within the taxon Rubiaceae, it is well represented in the main Brazilian biomes including the Amazoˆnia and the Cerrado. Coussarea hydrangeifolia, commonly know as ‘‘falsa-quina’’, is characteristic of the vegetation of the Cerrado and of the semi-deciduous forests of Brazil, where it is considered to be a pioneer species (Cor- rea, 1974). In the course of our studies concerning the bioactive principles of Brazilian plants, with special emphasis on the vegetation of the State of Sa˜o Paulo (Pauletti et al., 2003; Hamerski et al., 2003), we found that the aqueous extract of the leaves of C. hydrangeifolia showed antioxidant activity, as determined by a prelimin- ary test with b-carotene, and strong free radical scaveng- ing activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH). Fractionation of this extract provided ﬁve phe- nylpropanoid glycosides including two new compounds, 1 and 2, which had their structures determined by spec- troscopic methods. 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated from the aqueous extract of C. hydrangeifolia as an amorphous powder with an ½a30 D of 44.3. A quasimolecular ion peak [M H] for 1 was observed at m/z 415.1610 in the high-resolu- tion electrospray ionisation mass spectrum (HRESIMS; negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula of C19H28O10. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorp- tion bands at 3430 and 1042 cm1 suggesting the pres- ence of hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed signals that could be attributed to a monosubstituted benzene ring [d 7.54 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-2,6), 7.30 (m, H-3,5), 7.23 (m, H-4)], a b-D-glucosyl moiety [d 4.90 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-10), 4.06 (dd, J = 7.5, 8.0 Hz, H-20), 4.19 (t like, J = 8.0 Hz, H-30), 4.12 (m, H-4), 4.20 (ddd, J = 9.5, 7.5, 2.5 Hz, H-50), 4.18 (dd, J = 11.0, 7.5 Hz, H 60 a), 4.64 (dd, J = 11.0, 2.5 Hz, H 60 b), and a rhamnosyl group [d 5.55 (d, J = 1.0 Hz, H-100), 4.62 (m, H-200), 4.55 (dd, J = 3.5, 9.0 Hz, H-300), 4.26 (t like, J = 9.0 Hz, H-400), 4.97 (m, H-5), 1.62 (d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-600). Additionally, the signals at d 4.85 (d, J = 11.5 Hz) and 5.15 (d, J = 11.5 Hz) could be as- cribed to benzylic oxymethylene hydrogens, thus cha- racterising the aromatic portion of 1 as a benzylic system. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed sig- nals at d 137.8, 128.2 (2·), 127.9 (2·), 127.2 and 70.9, which were consistent with the presence of a monosub- stituted benzylic ring. Two anomeric methine carbons at d 103.7 and 102.6, several hydroxymethines, one hydroxymethylene carbon at d 68.4 and one methyl group at d 18.7 resembled those of glucose and rham- nose, respectively, and clearly suggested that 1 possessed glucopyranosyl and rhamnopyranosyl units. Data from COSY and TOCSY experiments revealed the hydrogen sets belonging to the glucosyl and rhamnosyl moieties. The complete assignment of hydrogen and carbon sig- nals and the positions of the bonds of the sugar moieties in 1 were determined by an HMBC experiment which showed long-range correlations between H-60 and C-40 and the anomeric C-100, between H-100 and the methylene C-60, and between H-7 of the benzylic system and C-10 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data of hydrangeifolin I (1), hydrangeifolin II (2) and 1,6-di-O-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranose (3) in pyridine-d5 Position 1 2 3 d 1H d 13C d 1H d 13H d 1H d 13C 1 – 137.8 (s) – 126.6 (s) – 127.6 (s) 2 7.54 d (7.5) 128.2 (d) 7.53 d (2.0) 115.8 (d) 7.05 m 111.7 (d) 3 7.30 m 127.9 (d) – 147.0 (s) – 148.8 (s) 4 7.23 m 127.2 (d) – 148.7 (s) – 149.5 (s) 5 7.30 m 127.9 (d) 7.16 d (8.0) 116.7 (d) 6.80 m 116.2 (d) 6 7.54 d (7.5) 128.2 (d) 7.10 dd (2.0; 8.0) 122.2 (d) 6.99 m 124.1 (d) 7 4.85 d (11.5) 70.9 (t) 7.97 d (15.5) 145.5 (d) 6.64 d (16.0) 114.8 (d) 5.15 d (11.5) 8 6.56 d (15.5) 114.4 (d) 7.93 d (16.0) 147.4 (d) 9 – 165.3 (s) – 169.6 (s) 10 4.90 d (7.5) 103.7 (d) 6.20 d (8.0) 96.1 (d) 4.48 d (7.4) 104.3 (d) 20 4.06 dd (7.5) 75.1 (d) 4.27 t (9.0) 78.8 (d) 4.04 t (9.0) 74.4 (d) 30 4.19 t (8.0) 77.2 (d) 4.34 m 78.5 (d) 3.95 t (9.0) 76.9 (d) 40 4.12 m 71.9 (d) 4.36 m 71.1 (d) 3.93 t (9.0) 71.0 (d) 50 4.20 ddd (9.5, 7.5, 2.5) 78.5 (d) 4.08 m 79.5 (d) 4.10 m 77.5 (d) 60 4.18 dd (11.0, 7.5) 68.4 (t) 4.40 d (12.0) 62.3 (t) 4.29 m 66.5 (t) 4.64 d (11.0, 2.5) 4.60 d (12.0) 4.39 m 100 5.55 d (1.0) 102.6 (d) 5.90 d (3.5) 94.2 (d) – 127.5 (s) 200 4.62 m 72.3 (d) 4.20 dd (3.5; 9.0) 74.6 (d) 7.05 m 111.7 (d) 300 4.55 dd (3.5; 9.0) 72.8 (d) 4.08 m 72.7 (d) – 148.8 (s) 400 4.26 t (9.0) 74.1 (d) 4.75 t (9.0) 75.5 (d) – 149.4 (s) 500 4.97 m 69.8 (d) 4.54 dd (2.5; 11.5) 63.1 (t) 6.80 m 116.2 (d) 4.42 dd (5.5; 11.5) 600 1.62 d (6.0) 18.7 (d) 6.99 m 124.1 (d) 700 6.52 d (15.5) 114.7 (d) 800 7.87 d (15.5) 147.1 (d) 900 – 169.7 (s) 1000 5.35 d (7.5) 99.6 (d) 2000 4.29 t (8.5) 74.3 (d) 3000 4.14 t (8.5) 76.9 (d) 4000 4.25 t (8.5) 72.2 (d) 5000 4.03 ddd (2.5; 5.5; 9.0) 78.6 (d) 6000 4.39 d (11.5) 63.3 (t) 4.58 d (11.5) 1928 L. Hamerski et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 1927–1932 of the glucosyl moiety and C-2/C-6 of the aromatic system. Consequently, the structure of 1 was established to be 10-O-benzyl-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(100 ! 60)-b-D- glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin I. Compound 2 exhibited a quasimolecular ion peak [M H] at m/z 635.1828 in the HRESIMS (negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula C26H36O18. MS/MS analysis of the quasimolecular ion revealed a signiﬁcant fragment ion at m/z 502.1321 assigned to [M H deoxyhexose]. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) clearly showed the presence of three sugar moieties together with nine additional signals that could be attributed to the aglycone moiety. Data from the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the pres- ence of an (E)-caﬀeoyl system [1H, d 7.97 (d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-7), 6.56 (1H, d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-8), 7.53 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2), 7.16 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5), 7.10 (1H, dd, J = 2.0, 8.0 Hz, H-6)] together with three anomeric protons, two of which [5.35 (d, J = 7.5 Hz) and 6.20 (d, J = 8.0 Hz)] were as- signed to the two b-glucose units, and one [d 5.90 (d, J = 3.5 Hz)], to an a-xylose moiety. From the 13C NMR spectrum it could be established that the aro- matic unit was an ester of (E)-caﬀeic acid [d 165.3 (C-9), 145.5 (C-7), 114.4 (C-8), 126.6 (C-1), 115.8 (C- 2), 147.0 (C-3), 148.7 (C-4), 116.7 (C-5), 122.2 (C-6)]. Complete assignment of the protons in each sugar sys- tem was achieved by considering the 1D and 2D TOCSY, 1D and 2D NOESY, and the 1H–1H COSY spectra, while the carbons were assigned from HMQC and HMBC data. A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at d 5.35 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) revealed a set of coupled oxymethine protons (d 4.29, 4.14, 4.25 and 4.03) and a methylene proton (d 4.39). These data, when ana- lysed with the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum, led to the identiﬁcation of a b-D- glucosyl moiety. Its position at C-3 of the caﬀeic acid moiety was established unambiguously by HMBC cor- relations observed between the anomeric proton H-1000 at d 5.35 and C-3 (d 147.0), and from the proton at d 7.10 (H-6) to C-2 (d 115.8) and C-4 (d 148.7). A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at d 6.20 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz) showed a set of coupled oxymethine pro- tons (d 4.27, 4.34, 4.36 and 4.08) and oxymethylene protons (d 4.40 and 4.60). Analysis of the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum led to the identiﬁcation of an additional b-D-glucosyl moiety. From the HMBC correlation observed between the signals at d 6.20 (H-10) and d 165.3 [the carbonyl of the (E)-caﬀeoyl group], the site of esteriﬁcation with the (E)-caﬀeoyl acid unit was determined to be at C- 10 of the glucopyranosyl. The downﬁeld shift of C-20 (d 78.8) together with the upﬁeld shift of C-10 (d 96.1) of the b-glucopyranosyl unit also suggested that the a-xylopyranosyl unit was attached to C-20 of the glucopyranosyl moiety. The cross peak in the HMBC experiment between d 4.27 (t, J = 9.0 Hz, H-20) and d 75.5 (C-400), and the correlation in the NOESY experiment between the signals at d 4.27 (t, J = 9.0, H-20) and at d 4.75 (t, J = 9.0, H-400), conﬁrmed the (400 ! 20) linkage of the disaccharide moiety. Acid hydrolysis of 2 aﬀorded glucose and xylose, which were identiﬁed by TLC by comparison with authentic samples. Consequently, the structure of 2 was estab- lished as a-L-xylopyranosyl-(400 ! 20)-(3-O-b-D-gluco- pyranosyl)-10-O E-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin II (see Fig. 1). Compound 3 was identiﬁed as 1,6-di-O-caﬀeoyl-b-D- glucopyranose from physical and spectroscopic data (Akhmedov and Litvinenko, 1968). Although this com- pound was ﬁrst isolated from Scrophularia grossheimi (a traditional medicinal plant used in Russia for the treat- ment of jaundice, hepatitis and rheumatism), to the best of our knowledge its 13C NMR spectroscopic data re- main unreported. The assignment of the 13C NMR sig- nals of 3, based mainly on 1D and 2D NMR experiments, is provided in Table 1. Compounds 4 and 5 were identiﬁed as 1-O-(E)-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranose and 1-O-(E)-feruloyl-b-D-glucopyranose, respectively (Birkofer et al., 1961, 1969). Preliminary TLC autographic test using b-carotene as revealing agent (Silva et al., 2001) evidenced several anti- oxidant compounds in the aqueous extract from leaves of C. hydrangeifolia.

As shown on Table 2, compounds 3 and 4 exhibited strong antioxidant activities, comparable with that of caﬀeic acid, probably due to the presence of the 3,4-dihy- droxy (catechol) moiety in their structures. Compounds 2 and 5, which bear only one free hydroxy group, showed weak free radical scavenging activities towards DPPH and compound 1 was inactive. 3. Experimental 3.1. General IR and UV spectra were obtained using Perkin–El- mer model 1600 series FTIR and Lambda 14P UV/ VIS spectrometers, respectively. ES-MS were measured on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRESIMS on a VG Autospec (40 eV) spectrometer. 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (125 MHz) and 2D NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Inova model 500 spec- trometer. The NMR data were measured in pyridine- d5 or DMSO-d6 and chemical shifts are expressed in d (ppm) values with reference to TMS. Preparative HPLC was conducted using a Phenomenex Luna ODS column (250 · 21.20 mm i.d.; 10 lm) coupled to a Varian Prep- Star S0-1 pump with ﬂow rate of the mobile phase set at 10 mL/min; and a Varian ProStar 320 UV/VIS detec- tor set at 254 nm.

Plant material Leaves of C. hydrangeifolia were collected in Mogi- Guac¸u (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil) in December 1997 and identiﬁed and authenticated by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil). A vou- cher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sa˜o Paulo (number SP 167423). 3.3. Antioxidant assay The b-carotene test was performed on TLC plates according to a previously described method (Pratt and Miller, 1984;Silva et al., 2001). The stable radical DPPH was used for the determination of free radical scaveng- ing activity: a methanolic solution (200 lM, 2 mL) of DPPH was added to methanol (1 mL) containing an appropriate amount of each test compound in order to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 or 5 lM. Caﬀeic and p-coumaric acids were used as stan- dard positive controls, whilst a solution of DPPH (200 lM, 2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as blank. All samples were evaluated as triplicates (n = 3). Each reaction mixture was shaken thoroughly and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The amount of the reduced form of the radical (DPPH-H) generated in situ was determined from the measured de- crease in current (I) in the electrochemical cell of the ElCD (Son and Lewis, 2002). The area measured on each chromatogram was normalised and compared with that obtained for the blank. The radical scavenging activity of each sample was expressed in terms of IC50 (the concentration in lM of test compound required to produce a 50% decrease in I caused by the formation of DPPH-H) (Pauletti et al., 2003). 3.4. Extraction and isolation Dried and powdered leaves (2.70 kg) of C. hydrangei- folia were extracted with EtOH (3.0 L) for 24 h at room temperature, followed by solvent evaporation under re- duced pressure to yield the crude extract (65.80 g). This extract was suspended in water (3.0 L) and partitioned with n-BuOH (3.0 L): the aqueous solution was evapo- rated to dryness and the resulting residue (2.0 g) sub- jected to gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.0 · 120 cm) eluted with MeOH. Fractions (10 mL each) were collected and analysed by TLC (CHCl3/ MeOH 6:4). On the basis of their TLC proﬁles, fractions 6–10 were combined (380.8 mg) and further subjected to over Sephadex LH-20 CC with MeOH as eluent. Frac- tions 8–12 from this second column fractionation were combined (54.3 mg) on the basis of their TLC proﬁles and puriﬁed by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2 O (1:9) to yield 1 (12.0 mg; tR 12.54 min). Fractions 13–14 from the ﬁrst Sephadex column were combined (500 mg) and subjected to CC over C-18 eluted with a MeOH/H2O step gradient (in ratios 1:19, 3:17 and 3:2, successively) to yield fractions A, B and C. Fraction A (132.7 mg) was further puriﬁed by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (7:93) to yield 2 (35.8 mg: tR 10.25 min). Fraction B (67.5 mg) was subjected to HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (1:9) to yield, 3 (6.1 mg; tR 22.38 min) and 4 (16.9 mg; tR 14.64 min). Fraction C (145.9 mg) was puriﬁed under the same conditions and aﬀorded 5 (8.4 mg, tR 18.91 min). 3.4.1.

It is involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among the proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, cathepsin V is a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In the present work, natural ﬂavonoids were screened against cathepsin V, and two ﬂavones were identiﬁed as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. On the basis of this result, a combinatorial library of chalcones and ﬂavones was prepared, in solution phase employing a scavenger reagent, and fully evaluated. Introduction Coronary arterial disease is one of the major causes of human death. In this context, atherosclerosis, which is characterized by a thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall, is the leading cause of cardiac illness. Cathepsin V is a papain-like cysteine protease, involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among proteolytic enzymes.1,2 It is predominantly expressed in the thymus, testicles, and epithelial corneal. Although cathepsin V can be considered a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, few inhibitors are described in the literature.2,3 The benzopyranone-ring system, found in ﬂavonoids, is a molecular scaffold of considerable interest, and some reports describe this class of compounds as inhibitors of cathepsin acitvity. Kenyon and co-workers reported the activity of chalcone derivatives toward the enzyme cathepsin B.4,5 Patil et al. isolated a new dimeric dihydrochalcone and a preny- lated ﬂavone from Artocarpus altilis (Moraceae) which are potent inhibitors of cathepsin K, with IC50 values of 98 and 840 nM, respectively.6 Pan et al.7 and Zeng et al.8 described biﬂavones isolated from Taxodium mucronatum (Taxodiacea) and Cycas guizhouensis (Cycadaceae) with activity against cathepsin B and K. Bauvois et al. examined the effects of synthetic ﬂavones on a number of metalloproteinases, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase as well as serine proteases such as cathepsin G.9 Medicinal chemistry efforts have focused on diversifying the benzopyranone scaffold and utilizing combinatorial chemistry approaches to construct small benzopyranone libraries.10 In the literature are described several ﬂavonoid libraries synthesized in solution phase, such as, for example, chalcones11–13 and ﬂavones.14,15 Solid-phase organic synthesis (SPOS) has long been an integral component of the synthetic repertoire employed by combinatorial chemists.16 In SPOS, solid support-bound substrates are elaborated synthetically by using an excess of reagents to drive reactions to completion. Desired products can then be isolated easily by simple ﬁltration and removed from the support material. Previous reviews have discussed the importance of combinatorial libraries of ﬂavonoids prepared by solid phase synthesis.17–19 Nicolaou et al. reported a solid-phase synthesis of a 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran motif employing a cycloloading strategy that relies on the use of a polystyrene-based selenenyl bromide resin.20 Harikrishnan and Showalter prepared a small library of isoﬂavone analogues employing a solid-supported diisopro- pylsilyloxy traceless linker.21 Cheng et al. prepared a small library of chalcones via parallel solid phase synthesis.22 A different strategy was employed by Yao et al. for the preparation of a ﬂavone library.23 A functionalized ﬂavone was prepared in solution phase by classical Claisen conden- sation, mixed acid nitration, and oxidative cyclization reac- tion with iodine-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Then, the ﬂavone was employed as scaffold for the synthesis of a combinatorial library in solid phase. Arai et al. developed an efﬁcient one-pot synthesis by Michael aldol reaction of chromone and ﬂavonoid derivatives bearing heterocyclic units.24 The 2,3-heterocyclic-substituted chromones were obtained in one step. Moreover, the use of substituted benzaldehydes and subsequent addition of heterocyclic aldehydes gave 3-pyridyl-substituted ﬂavones. They have also examined these one-pot reactions in the solid phase by attaching the acetophenone derivative to (4-methoxyphenyl)- diisopropylsilylpropyl polystyrene beads. * Towhomcorrespondenceshouldbeaddressed.E-mail:agcorrea@ufscar.br.

Chem. 2010, 12, 687–695 687 10.1021/cc100076k 2010 American Chemical Society Published on Web 06/25/2010 SPOS has many advantages but also many limiting drawbacks: it can be difﬁcult to adapt conventional solution phase chemistry to a solid-phase format, some solid-phase reactions are signiﬁcantly slower than they are when run in solution, and the progress of solid-phase reactions can be difﬁcult to monitor.11 An alternative is the use of polymer- supported reagents, catalysts, and cleanup agents (scavengers) which facilitate reactions of substrates in solution. For example, a solid-supported reagent can be used to drive to completion a coupling reaction between two reactive sub- strates, one of which is present in excess. A support-bound scavenger can then be used to remove the excess reagent, yielding pure product. Or a support-bound capture reagent can be used to remove the coupling product directly, which is then cleaved from the support.25 Bhat et al. employed a piperazinyl Merriﬁeld resin in the synthesis of a library of ﬂavones.26 Huang et al. described a solid-phase synthesis of ﬂavones employing a Lewis acid-mediated polystyrene- supported selenium induced intramolecular cyclization of chalcones.27 After the oxidative cleavage of selenium resin, the ﬂavones were obtained in good overall yields and high purity. In the present work, we describe the use of tosyl hydrazide scavenger resin in the preparation of a combinatorial library of chalcone and ﬂavone derivatives, identiﬁed as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. Results and Discussion In an ongoing program toward the development of speciﬁc, potent inhibitors of cathepsin V enzyme, several natural products were screened. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation: where Vi and V0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determined in the presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively. Among some other active compounds, a series of ﬂa- vonoids showed interesting activity at initial concentration of 25 µM. The most potent compounds were ﬂavones 1 and 2 (Figure 1), isolated from Vitex polygama (Verbenaceae)28 and Lonchocarpus subglaucescens (Leguminoseae),29 re- spectively, with IC50 ) 2.5 and 13.5 µM. The IC50 values correspond to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V, and were determined from collected data by non-linear regression analysis. On the basis of these results, a small library of ﬂavonoids waspreparedinsolutionphaseemployingtheClaisen-Schmidt condensation,30 followed by oxidative cyclization catalyzed by I2 (Scheme 1).31 The library components were obtained in moderate to good yields and were characterized by 1H NMR and MS. The compounds then were submitted to biochemical evaluation against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 1). In this small series we have already identiﬁed ﬂavone (6d) with a higher inhibition activity than the natural products 1 Figure 1. Natural ﬂavonoids evaluated against cathepsin V. Scheme 1.

To evaluate a larger number of ﬂavonoids and establish some structure-activity relationships, a ﬂavone library was prepared through parallel synthesis using the polystyrene-tosyl hydrazide (PS-Ts-NHNH2) (7) as a car- bonyl scavenging resin.32 Before carrying out the synthesis of the library some tests were realized to optimize the reaction conditions using the resin. The best results were obtained using 0.075 mmol of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxyace- tophenone, 0.1 mmol of resin 7, and 0.1 mmol of 2,4- dimethoxybenzaldehyde, at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and the presence of the aldehydes was not observed. Following the reaction conditions previously tested, a library of chalcones and ﬂavones was prepared (Scheme 2) using 4 acetophenones (3) (Figure 2) and 6 aldehydes (4) as building blocks (Figure 3). The diversity of the library was planned based on the structure of natural products 1 and 2, which are highly oxygenated, and also on the commercial availability of reagents. The reactions were carried out in 24 reaction vessels of a Bu¨chi Syncore synthesizer. Initially, for the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, to a solution containing the acetophenone 3 and the aldehyde 4 in methanol was added an aqueous solution of 50% KOH. After 3 h at 75 °C, an aqueous solution of 10% HCl was added to neutralize the mixture. Excess of aldehyde was removed from the reaction mixture by the use of resin scavenger 7 in dimethylformamide (DMF). Oxidative cyclization was carried out in DMSO at 150 °C for 1 h using iodine as catalyst. Thirteen chalcones 5 were puriﬁed by preparative TLC and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 2). As observed before, the chalcones showed no activity. The ﬂavones were puriﬁed by SPE or preparative TLC. Analyses Table 1.

Combinatorial Library of Chalcones and Flavones Journal of Combinatorial Chemistry, 2010 Vol. 12, No. 5 689 by HPLC in three different wavelengths (254, 280, and 320 nm) showed that 21 ﬂavones 6 were prepared in low to moderate yield (13-68%) and good to high purity (80-95%). All compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and the spectroscopic data were compared with those reported in the literature.33–57 The library components were submitted to biochemical evaluation (Table 3). The ﬁrst aspect of the validation of these results was the analysis of false positives. Depending on the assay design and detection method used for the screening assay, various artifacts can occur that lead to wrong results. Before performing the screening, all compounds were analyzed on a ﬂuorimeter using the test conditions without the addition of the enzyme. Flavones 6a, 6c, 6{1,2}, 6{2,4}, and 6{4,4} showed intrinsic ﬂuorescence; thus, it was not possible to verify their potency as inhibitors. Compounds that inhibited more than 50% were selected for determination of IC50 values. When diluted, ﬂavones 6{1,1}, 6{1,3}, and 6{2,1} showed ﬂuorescence above the control, suggesting that at lower concentrations these compounds may cause a confor- mational change of the protein, and it was not possible to observe the ﬂuorescence quenching, thus interfering with the response of the test. Most of the ﬂavones showed signiﬁcant inhibition with IC50 values varying in the range of 0.8-25.1 µM. Primary studies on the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the ﬂavonoids suggest the importance of the ring C. Interestingly the chalcones exhibited lower inhibition in a unique con- centration demonstrating that cyclization to form the C ring is relevant to interaction between enzyme site and inhibitor. We also observed that among the most potent compounds, ﬂavones 6d, 6{3,1}, and 6{3,2} (IC50 ) 1.2, 0.8, and 1.6 µM, respectively) possess one halogen (bromine or ﬂuorine) as substituent in the A ring and methoxy groups in the C ring. In conclusion, despite the lack of a detailed experimental enzyme-inhibitor complex, from the natural products screen- ing, we have been able to identify synthetic ﬂavones with increased potency. These results indicate the potential of this class as promising inhibitors of cathepsin V. To further investigate these results and thus generate useful data for the computer aided molecular design, modeling studies are being performed through docking protocol. 3. Experimental Section All commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Reagents and solvents were puriﬁed when necessary according to the usual procedures described in the literature. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-200 (200 and 50 MHz respectively). The IR spectra refer to ﬁlms and were measured on a Bomem M102 spectrometer. Mass Spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on a 0.25 µm ﬁlm of silica gel containing ﬂuorescent indicator UV254 supported on an aluminum sheet (Sigma-Aldrich). Flash column chromatography was per- formed using silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 230-400 mesh, E. Merck). Gas chromatography was performed in a Shimadzu GC-17A with H2 as carrier and using a DB-5 column. Solid- phase extraction (SPE) was carried out using silica cartridges (Phenomenex Strata Silica SL-1, 500 mg, 6 mL). HPLC analyses were performed in Shimadzu equipment with a LC- 20AT pump, SIL-10A injector, SPD-20A detector, and in a Phenomenex column Luna C18(2) 5 µm (150 × 4.6 mm).

Synthesis of the Combinatorial Library of Flavones 6. In 24 reaction vessels of a Bu¨chi Syncore synthesizer was placed a solution of acetophenone 3{1-4} (0.075 mmol) and aldehyde 4{1-6} (0.10 mmol) (Figure 2) in methanol (2.0 mL). Then it was added an aqueous solution of KOH 50% (150 µL). The mixture was stirred at 75 °C for 3 h, and then an aqueous solution of HCl 10% (750 µL) was added. The solvent was evaporated, then ethyl acetate (3 mL) was added and the organic layer was transferred to another vessel. This procedure was repeated three times and then concentrated under vacuum. Then DMF (1 mL) was added followed by PS-Ts-NHNH2 (7) (50 mg, 0.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, then it was washed with methylene chloride (3 mL), and the organic layer was transferred to another vessel. This procedure was repeated three times; then the solvent was evaporated furnishing chalcones 5. One third was separated for further character- ization and bioassays. To the previously prepared chalcones 5 was added a 1 mg/mL solution of iodine in DMSO (1 mL). The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 150 °C, and then an aqueous solution of 0.1 M sodium thiosulfate (0.1 mL) was added. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum, and the crude product was puriﬁed by SPE using silica gel (500 mg) and methylene chloride: ethyl acetate (8:2) or preparative TLC using hexane: ethyl acetate (8:2) as eluent. The ﬂavones 6 were analyzed by HPLC (see Table 3), characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme. 4′-Benzyloxy-2′-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone (5{1,1}).37 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.86 (s, 3H); 5.11 (s, 2H); 6.47-6.62 (m, 2H); 6.94 (d, J ) 8.6 Hz, 2H); 7.30-7.53 (m, 6H); 7.61 (d, J ) 8.6 Hz, 2H); 7.82 (d, J ) 2.8 Hz, 1H); 7.88 (d, J ) 8.7 Hz, 1H); 13.52 (s, 1H). 4′-Benzyloxi-2′-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethoxychalcone (5{1,3}).38 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.90 (s, 3H); 3.92 (s, 3H); 3.97 (s, 3H); 5,11 (s, 2H); 6.50-6.62 (m, 2H); 6.73 (d, J ) 8.9 Hz, 1H); 7.31-7.52 (m, 6H); 7.63 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 7.78-7.90 (m, 1H); 8.05 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 13.56 (s, 1H). 4′-Benzyloxy-2′-hydroxy-4-triﬂuoromethoxychal- cone (5{1,4}). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 5.12 (s, 2H); 6.52-6.64 (s, 2H); 7.25-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.35-7.47 (m, 5H); 7.54 (J ) 15.5 Hz, 1H); 7.63-7.75 (m, 2H); 7.84 (d, J ) 9.5 Hz, 1H); 7.86 (J ) 15.5 Hz, 1H); 13.32 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-4,4′,6′-trimethoxychalcone (5{2,1}):39 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.84 (s, 3H); 3.85 (s, 3H); 3.92 (s, 3H); 5.97 (d, J ) 2.4, 1H); 6.11 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.87-7.02 (m, 2H); 7.51-7.63 (m, 2H); 7.80 (s, 2H); 14.40 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-2,4,4′,6′-tetramethoxychalcone (5{2,2}).40 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.83 (s, 3H); 3.86 (s, 3H); 3.90 (s, 3H); 3.91 (s, 3H); 5.96 (dd, J ) 2.4, 0.2 Hz, 1H); 6.10 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.47 (dd, J ) 2.4, 0.3 Hz, 1H); 6.53 (ddd, J ) 8.5, 2.3, 0.3 Hz, 1H); 7.55 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, 1H); 7.90 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 8.11 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 14.54 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-2,3,4,4′,6′-pentamethoxychalcone (5{2,3}).41 1H NMR(200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.84 (s, 3H); 3.89 (s, 3H); 3.91 (s, 3H); 3.95 (s, 3H); 5.96 (d, J ) 2.4, 1H); 6.11 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.72 (d, J ) 8.8 Hz, 1H); 7.35 (d, J ) 8.8 Hz, 1H); 7.90 (d, J ) 15.8 Hz, 1H); 8.02 (d, J ) 15.8 Hz, 1H); 14.44 (s, 1H). 4-Phenyl-2′-hydroxy-4′,6′-dimethoxychalcone (5{2,6}). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.85 (s, 3H); 3.94 (s, 3H); 5.98 (d, J ) 2.3 Hz, 1H); 6.12 (d, J ) 2.3 Hz, 1H); 7.35-7.55 (m, 3H); 7.57-7.75 (m, 6H); 15.65 (d, J ) 15.7 Hz, 1H); 7.96 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 14.32 (s, 1H). 5′-Fluoro-2′-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone (5{3,1}).42 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.88 (s, 3H); 6.91-7.06 (m, 3H); 7.17-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.42 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 7.52-7.2 (m, 3H); 7.93 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 12.65 (s, 1H). 5′-Fluoro-2′-hydroxy-2,4-dimethoxychalcone (5{3,2}). mp 106-107 °C. 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.87 (s, 3H); 3.93 (s, 3H); 6.48 (d, J ) 2.2 Hz, 1H); 6.55 (dd, J ) 8.5, 2.2 Hz, 1H); 6.97 (dd, J ) 9.0, 4.8 Hz, 1H); 7.14-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.52-7.67 (m, 3H); 8.18 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 12.81 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 55.5; 55.6; 692 Journal of Combinatorial Chemistry, 2010 Vol. 12, No. 5 Alvim, Jr. et al. 98.5; 105.7; 114.5 (d, J ) 23.1 Hz); 116.7; 117.5; 119.6 (d, J ) 7.0 Hz); 119.9 (d, J ) 6.2 Hz); 123.2 (d, J ) 23.5 Hz); 131.8; 142.2; 154.8 (d, J ) 237.5 Hz); 159.6 (d, J ) 1.6 Hz); 160.9; 163.7; 193 (d, J ) 2.8 Hz).

Inhibitory Activity Assay. Recombinant human cathepsin V was expressed and puriﬁed as described previously.57 The molar concentration of this enzyme was determined by active site titration with E-64. Kinetic measurements were carried out in a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX GEMINI XS. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO, and the inhibitors were screened against the cathe- psin V at initial concentration of 25 µM. The protease inhibitor activity was carried out in triplicate in 96-well black plate with the method previously described by Barret et al.58 The reaction mixture contained 192 µL of a sodium acetate buffer (100 mM, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTE, pH 5.5), 2 µL of 1 mM Z-Phe-Arg-MCA, 5 µL of sample, and 1 µL of cathepsin V (32 nM). The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE at 27 °C, after the solution was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The substrate was added to start the reaction, and the ﬂuorescence of 4-methyl-7- coumaryl-amide (release MCA) was measured at Ex 355 nm and Em 460 nm. Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the E-64 (positive control), an irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase. Values of IC50 were determined by making rate measurements for at least seven inhibitor concentrations. Kinetics parameters were determined from collected data employing the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. References and Notes (1) Yasuda, Y.; Li, Z.; Greenbaum, D.; Bogyo, M.; Weber, E.; Bro¨mme, D.

Vieira, and Sakae Komatsu Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natural Resources, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720 Three anacardic acids (1-3) have been isolated as cytotoxic agents against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells from the cashew Anacardium occidentale (Anacardiaceae) apple juice. In addition to these anacardic acids, the cytotoxicity of their 13 congeners (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut and nut shell oil has also been examined. Anacardic acids (1-4), cardols (5-81, and methylcardols (9-12) have been found to exhibit moderate cytotoxic activity against both BT-20 breast and HeLa epithelioid cervix carcinoma cells. INTRODUCTION We now control many tumors with available antitumor agents. However, the need for new antitumor agents still exists, especially against solid tumors. The unacceptable and undesired side effects of many antitumor agents are a major problem that needs to be improved, due to the need for the antitumor agents to be used for long durations. It seems that edible plants may be a good source of new antitumor agents. With this in mind, we have screened for new antitumor agents from various tropical fruits and vegetables that have been continuously consumed by many people for many years. In recent years the cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) (Anacardiaceae) apple has increased in value, especially in the countries where it is grown, such as Brazil. There is no doubt that the nut is the most important product of the cashew tree. However, this tree also yields the pear- shaped \"apple\" to which the nut is attached. The cashew apple is very sour and astringent until fully ripe, when it becomes edible. In contrast to the nut, the apple was neglected until recently, although it is available in far greater tonnage. A number of processes have now been developed for converting the cashew apple into various products such as juice, jam, syrup, chutney, and beverage (Winterhalter, 1991). Cashew apple juice is, in fact, one of the most popular juices in Brazil today. In our continuing search for prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors from tropical plants (Kubo et al., 1987) we began to test their antitumor activity, since many prostaglandin- related compounds exhibited potent antitumor activity (Zenser et al., 1980; Powles et al., 1982). Our preliminary screening has found the cashew (A. occidentale) apple juice to show significant (EDXI <20 pg/mL) in vitro cytotoxicity against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells. The active principles from a regularly imbibed beverage such as cashew apple juice may be superior as antitumor agents as compared to many nonnatural products. This paper deals with the identification of cytotoxic principles of cashew apple juice. MATERIALS AND METHODS General. UV spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 100-80 spectrophotometer in ethanol. IR spectra were acquired on a Perkin-Elmer 1310 IR in KBr. NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL GX-400 (400 MHz for lH and 100 MHz for l3C) in CDCl,. EIMS were acquired on a JEOL DX-303HF by direct inlet 70 eV. Recycle HPLC (R-HPLC) was performed on a LC-09 (Japan Analytical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) (Kubo and Nakatsu, 1991). Chemicals. The phenolic compounds 1-16 (Figure 1) used for bioassay were from our previous study (Kubo et al., 1986). However, the repurification of some of them was achieved by R-HPLC. Anethole was isolated from the seeds of Pimpinella anisum (Umbelliferae) as previously described (Kubo and Himejima, 1991). Indole, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), vitamin C, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo- lium bromide (M'M') were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Plant Materials. Suco de Caju, a commercial cashew apple juice (Maguary and Milani) was purchased at market places in SHo Paulo, SHo Carlos, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Cell Lines and Media. The cell lines BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma isolated from human, and HeLa ATCC CCL 219, epithelioid cervix carcinoma cell from human, used for the assay were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with nonessential amino acids supple- mented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO1-95 % air at 37 \"C. Thehumanmonolayer culture weresubculturedwitha0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution. Cytotoxic Assay. The cytotoxic assays were performed according to a microculture tetrazolium (MTT) method (Car- michaelet d., 1987). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtiter plates at 4000-6000 celldwell, with various concentrations of the samples. After incubation, 50 Fg/mL MTT (3 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The form- dye was solubilized by adding 100 pg/mL DMSO to each well, followed by gentle shaking. The extinction coefficient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photometer Labsystem, at a wavelength of 620 nm. Combination Study. The combination data were obtained according to the checkerboard method (Norden et al., 1979). Thus, a series of the 2-fold dilutions of anacardic acid (1) was tested in combination with 2-fold dilutions of the other (anethole, indole, BHA, and vitamin C) (Figure 2). Each compound was tested at least twice. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The cytotoxicity-guided fractionation using BT-20 breast carcinoma cells has led to the isolation of three active principles from the cashew (A. occidentale) apple by R-HPLC using an ODS Cle column. The active compounds were identified by means of spectroscopic methods as anacardic acids, more specifically, 6-[8(Z),- 11 (2) ,1Cpentadecatrienyllsalicylic acid (11, 6- [8(2),11- (2)-pentadecadienyllsalicylic acid (21, and 6- [8(Z)-pen- tadecenyl] salicylic acid (3). These nonisoprenoid alkyl side chain phenolic compounds were previously isolated from the cashew (A. occidentale) nut shell oil together 0021-856 11931 1441-10 12$04.00/0 1993 Amerlcan Chemlcal Soclety Antkumor Agents from Cashew J.

Similar nonisoprenoid long-chain phe- nols including anacardic acid (3) were isolated as antitumor agents against Sarcoma ascites in mice from the sarcotesta of Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) (Itokawa et al., 1987). In addition to the 3 above-mentioned anacardic acids (1-3) isolated from the cashew apple, 13 additional phenolic compounds (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut and cashew nut shell oil (Tyman, 1979) were also examined for comparison purposes. They were first assayed against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells at 10 pg/mL. As a result, anacardic acids (1-4), cardols (5-81, and methylcardol(9- 12) exhibited significant cytotoxicity. Interestingly, car- danols (13-16) did not demonstrate significant activity against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells, although 5-[8(2),- 11(Z),14-pentadecatrienyllresorcinol (5) was previously reported to exhibit potent antitumor activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (Itokawa et al., 1987). The EDm values of the phenolic compounds (1-12) were first obtained against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells (Table I). Then, only the active compounds (EDm < 10 pg/mL) were tested against HeLa epitheloidid cervix carcinoma cells. The most effective cytotoxicity was observed for the cardols, followed by the anacardic acids and then the 1014 J. Agric. FoodChem., Vol. 41, No. 6, 1993 B H A Kubo et el.

In ai lition to the natura. phenolic com- pounds (1-16), salicylic acid (17) and resorcinol (18) were also tested. Neither salicylic acid nor resorcinol exhibited any activity against these two carcinoma cells at this concentration. By comparison of salicylic acid (17) and resorcinol (18) with the corresponding anacardic acids (1- 4) and cardols (5-81, it seems that the addition of a CIS alkyl side chain plays an important role in increasing the cytotoxicity. In fact, logP (as the hydrophobic parameter) of long-chain phenols was found to be one of the most important factors for the EDm values against Chinese hamster V-79 cells (Itokawa et al., 1989). Moreover, all of the phenolic compounds isolated from the cashew (nut, apple, and nut shell oil) have a CU alkyl side chain with up to three double bonds. In the previous investigation of their molluscicidal and antimicrobial activities, an increase in the number of double bonds in the side chain, in general, increases the biological activity (Gellerman et al., 1969; Himejima and Kubo, 1991; Kubo et al., 1986). However, this seems not to be the case in the cytotoxic activity, although the phenolics possessing a CIS saturated alkyl side chain were found to be somehow less cytotoxic than the ones with a CIS unsaturated alkylgroup. Although the cytotoxicity of these phenolics may not be potent enough to use them as a leading compound for drug design, they are worthy of further investigation as natural producta isolated from a daily beverage. Therefore, the enhancement of their cytotoxicity by combining them with other substances was studied. The procedure for selecting these \"other substances\" is, however, still in a preliminary stage. The initial selection of other substances was based largely on our previous combination studies of antimicrobial agents. For example, the antifungal activity of polygodial against a filamentous fungus Candida albicans was enhanced 32-fold by combining it with sublethal amounts of anethole (Kubaand Himejima, 1991). Similarly, the antibacterial activity of crinitol against a cariogenic bactarium Streptococcus mutans was increased 64fold by BHT (Kubo et al., 1992a), and that of 6-cadinene was enhanced 128-fold by indole (Kubo et al., 1992b). Vitamin C was also added for the combination study because of its high content in the cashew apple. Thus, the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content in the cashew apple is reported to be greater than 6 times that for oranges (Cecchi and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981). Moreover, vitamin C (anti- oxidant) was found to increase the antifungal activity of both polygodial and warburganal 16-fold against a der- matomycotic fungus Pityrosporum ouale (Kubo and Himejima, 1992). Since these four compounds have been used as food additives, we can assume that their safety has been established. For the combination study, 6-[8(2),11(2),14-pentade- catrienyllsalicylic acid (I), otherwise known as anacardic acid, was selected for the following reasons: (1) it has been isolated from the edible cashew apple; (2) its ED60 values against the two human solid tumor (BT-20 breast and HeLa epitheloidid cervix) cells are less than 4 pg/mL, that is, it satisfies the NCI requirement to warrant further investigation; and (3) most importantly for conducting this experiment, it is available in quantity. Anacardic acid (1) was, therefore, combined with anethole, BHA, indole, and vitamin C, respectively. The combination study was carried out against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells by the checkerboard method (Norden et al., 1979). In contrast to the antimicrobial activity, none of these four compounds dramatically increased the cytotoxicity of anacardic acid (1). Their effect was only additive. As an example, the combination study of anacardic acid (1) with BHA by the checkerboard method is shown in Figure 2. The total yield of the antitumor anacardic acids (1-3) in the freeze-dried cashew apple juice was reported at about 0.05% (Kubo et al., 1986). In addition to these anacardic acids, the high content of vitamin C in the cashew apple is described above (Cecchi and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981). Together with previous papers (Kubo et al., 1987; Itokawa et al., 1987), these datasuggest that consuming the cahsew apple and/or ita products continuously for long durations may be advantageous in controlling tumors.

The MeOH extract of leaves of Iryanthera juruensis, one of the plants endemic to the Amazon region and consumed in Brazil, and the hexane extract from its seeds inhibited lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2)) enzymes in in vitro assays. Further analyses of these extracts yielded 5-deoxyflavones (1-5) from the leaf extract and sargachromenol (6), sargaquinoic acid (7), a novel juruenolic acid (8), ω-arylalkanoic acids (9a-c), and the lignan guaiacin (10) from the seed extract. Compounds 3-5 inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88% at 10 ppm, respectively, and compounds 6 and 9a-c showed inhibition at 76% and 78% at 100 ppm, respectively. However, compounds 7 and 8 were inactive and lignan 10 exhibited LPO inhibitory activity by 99% at 100 ppm compared to commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and vitamin E. The flavones 1-5 also inhibited COX-1 and -2 enzymes by 50-65% at 100 ppm. Compound 6 showed high but nonselective inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, when compared to aspirin and Celebrex, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Compounds 7 and 10 inhibited COX-1 by 60% and 65% and COX-2 by 37% and 18%, respectively, whereas compounds 8 and 9a-c showed little or no activity against these enzymes. KEYWORDS: Iryanthera juruensis; Myristicaceae; lipid peroxidation; cyclooxygenase; flavone; tocotrienol; ω-arylalkanoic acids; lignan INTRODUCTION Plants from Myristicaceae family have been traditionally used as food supplements by South American Indians. The anecdotal health benefits of these plants are implicated in healing stomach infections and wounds and for inducing central nervous system (CNS) alterations when used during religious ceremonies. The Iryanthera species are endemic to the Amazon region and their crushed leaves were reported to heal infected wounds and cuts. Also, the latex from the barks, mixed with warm water, was used for treating infections (1). The seeds of Iryanthera species are valued in Brazil for their high yield in fatty acids, which also explains their general designation as “ucu-uba”, or fat- producing tree. The protein-rich aril and roasted seeds as well as beverages prepared from the crushed leaves of Iryanthera are consumed by native people in the Amazon region. The major constituent in the seeds of Iryanthera species is myristic acid, a C14 fatty acid. It usually co-occurs with antioxidant toco- trienols and is extensively used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries (2). In the course of our systematic studies on Iryanthera species, we have demonstrated the presence of antioxidant tocotrienols, flavonoids, and flavonolignans in fruits and leaves of Iryanthera grandis, Iryanthera lancifolia, Iryan- thera sagotiana, and Iryanthera juruensis (3-7). Oxidative damage to the cell membrane and its components is the initial event in several human disease processes, including cancer and atherosclerosis. Iryanthera spp. are known for their health benefits and hence we have continued the search for natural antioxidants in this plant species. It is a popular notion that regular consumption of antioxidant compounds imparts beneficial effects to biological systems and that such compounds act as chemopreventive agents. It has been established that compounds with radical scavenging activity are beneficial to health since they induce detoxifying enzymes (8, 9). As part of ongoing projects aimed at the discovery of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora [Biota-FAPESP (www.biotasp.org.br) and BIOprospecTA (www.bioprospecta.org. br)], the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of 56 plant extracts have been examined by means of in vitro assays measuring the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and * Corresponding author: fax +1-517-432-2310; e-mail nairm@msu.edu. † Sa˜o Paulo State University. ‡ Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals, Michigan State Uni- versity. § Center for Human Nutrition, University of California at Los Angeles.

The methanol and hexane extracts of I. juruensis leaves and seeds, respectively, were subjected to bioassay-directed chro- matographic purification. This paper presents the comparative LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities of the pure isolates and of crude extracts along with commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and vitamin E, as well as clinically used antiinflam- matory agents aspirin and Celebrex. Also, this is the first report of flavones 1-5 from I. juruensis and of the novel juruenolic acid (8). MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedures. UV and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B and a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1750 spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR spectra [1H, 13C, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experi- ments] were measured on Varian INOVA (300 MHz) and VRX (500 MHz) instruments. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to residual proton signals of CDCl3 at 7.24 and DMSO-d6 at 2.50. Coupling constants, J, are in Hertz. 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to residual 13C signals of CDCl3 at 77.0 and DMSO-d6 at 39.5. Standard pulse sequences were employed for all 1D [1H, 13C, and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)] and 2D (COSY, HMBC, and HMQC) NMR experiments. Mass spectra were recorded at the Michigan State University mass spectrometry facility on a JEOL HX- 110 double-focusing mass spectrometer (Peabody, MA) operating in the positive ion mode for fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and high-resolution (HR) FABMS experiments. Merck silica gel (60 mesh size, 35-70 µm) with particle size of 60 µm was used for preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). For preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation, 250, 500, and 1000 µm silica gel plates (Analtech, Inc., Newark, DE) were used. TLC plates were viewed under UV light at 254 and 366 nm or sprayed with 10% sulfuric acid solution. Solvents were of ACS reagent grade and were purchased from Spectrum Chemical Co. (Gardena, CA). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), R-tocopherol, dimethyl sul- foxide (DMSO), and acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Celebrex was a physician professional sample. 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine was pur- chased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and 3-[p-(6- phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl]phenylpropionic acid was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were prepared in the Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals Laboratory (BNPP) from ram seminal vesicles and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2), from cloned insect cell lysate, respectively (12). Plant Material and Extract Preparation. Leaves and fruits of I. juruensis were collected in Reserva do Mocambo, in the Amazon forest in January during the rainy season, and identified as Iryanthera juruensis Warburg by botanist Nelson Rosa. A voucher specimen, ID 141860 MG, was deposited at the Herbarium Joa˜o Murc¸a Pires at Museu Paraense Emı´lio Goeldi (Bele´m, PA, Brazil). The dried and ground leaves (111 g) and seeds (53 g) were extracted separately with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol at room temperature, using 3 × 300 mL of each solvent for extraction of leaves and 3 × 130 mL of each solvent for extraction of seeds. Solvents were removed under vacuum by use of a rotary evaporator and afforded the crude extracts hexane (1.4 g), EtOAc (1.8 g), and MeOH (6.4 g) from leaves and hexane (13.5 g), EtOAc (14.1 g), and MeOH (3.3 g) from seeds. Isolation of Constituents. The MeOH extract from the leaves of I. juruensis (3.2 g) was stirred with CHCl3 and filtered to remove the precipitate (1.5 g). The CHCl3-soluble part of this extract was concentrated (1.7 g) and subjected to MPLC on silica gel. Elution with hexane/acetone (H/A) solvent system under gradient conditions (H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL) afforded 11 fractions (A1-A3, 100 mL each; A4- A6, 200 mL each; A7, 300 mL; A8 and A9, 250 mL each; and A10 and A11, 200 mL each). Fraction A7 was precipitated with acetone and gave pure compound 3 (17 mg) as a pale yellow precipitate. The acetone-soluble portion was concentrated (240 mg) and was further chromatographed on a silica gel MPLC column with CHCl3/MeOH (C/M) under gradient conditions (CHCl3 100%, 100 mL; C/M 99:1, 100 mL; C/M 49:1, 200 mL; C/M 19:1, 300 mL; C/M 9:1, 200 mL; C/M 4:1, 200 mL; C/M 3:1, 100 mL; C/M 1:1, 100 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) to give 12 fractions (B1-B3, 100 mL each; B4-B5, 150 mL each; B6-B11, 100 mL each; B12, 200 mL). Fractions B2-B4 were combined on the basis of their comparative TLC profiles and submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 19:1 v/v) to give compounds 1 (2.6 mg, Rf 0.5) and 2 (2.2 mg, Rf 0.4). Similarly, silica gel MPLC of fractions A8-A10 (340 mg) eluted with CHCl3/MeOH solvent systems (CHCl3 100%, 100 mL; C/M 99:1, 200 mL; C/M 49:1, 300 mL; C/M 19:1, 400 mL; C/M 9:1, 300 mL; C/M 4:1, 200 mL; C/M 3:1, 100 mL; C/M 1:1, 100 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) afforded 13 fractions (C1 and C2, 200 mL each; C3 and C4, 100 mL each; C5-C10, 150 mL each; C11-C13, 100 mL each). Preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 9:1 v/v) of fraction C6 yielded compounds 4 (6 mg, Rf 0.4) and 5 (4 mg, Rf 0.3). The hexane extract of seeds (5.1 g) was stirred with hot MeOH and was filtered. The MeOH-soluble fraction was concentrated (2.7 g) and subjected to MPLC purification on silica gel with hexane/acetone (H/ A) as the mobile phase under gradient conditions (H/A 49:1, 200 mL; H/A 19:1, 200 mL; H/A 9:1, 400 mL; H/A 4:1, 400 mL; H/A 7:3, 400 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) to afford 28 fractions (D1 and D2, 200 mL each; D3-D6, 100 mL each; D7-D14, 50 mL each; D15- D21, 100 mL each; D22-D25, 50 mL each; D26-D28, 200 mL each). Fraction D12 was precipitated with hexane to give compounds 9a-c (56 mg) as a white precipitate. Fractions D16-D18 (149 mg) were combined and further submitted to MPLC (hexane/acetone gradient: H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; acetone 100%, 100 mL) to afford five fractions (E1 and E2, 250 mL each; E3-E5, 300 mL each); preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH, 49:1, v/v) of fraction E4 afforded compound 8 (10 mg, Rf 0.3). Fractions D22-D24 (1.26 g) were pooled and also submitted to MPLC (hexane/acetone gradient: H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 7:3, 400 mL; H/A 3:1, 400 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 300 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL) to afford nine fractions (F1-F3, 300 mL each; F4-F9, 200 mL each), which gave compounds 6 (44 mg) and 7 (18 mg) as brown oils from fractions F8 and F3, respectively. Preparative TLC (hexane/acetone 3:1 v/v) of fraction F6 gave compound 10 (26 mg, Rf 0.4). 2-(4′-Methylpentenyl-3)-10-oxoundecan-2,6-dienoic acid (juruenolic acid, 8): Pale yellow oil; UV λmaxMeOH nm (ϵ): 246 (3800).

Antioxidant Assays: â-Carotene Assay. TLC plates were developed in appropriate solvent systems. After developing and drying, TLC plates were sprayed with a 0.02% solution of â-carotene (Aldrich) in MeOH. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background (10). Each plant extract was tested in two elution systems (CHCl3/ MeOH, 9:1 v/v, and CHCl3/MeOH/H2O, 13:6:1 v/v/v) for observation of low-, medium-, and high-polarity compounds. The yellow spots retained on the TLC plates indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the extracts tested. Lipoperoxidation Inhibition Assay. These antioxidant bioassays were conducted by analysis of model liposome oxidation by use of fluorescence spectroscopy (11). The lipid, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn- glycerol-3-phosphocholine (5 µmol), and fluorescent probe, 3-[p-(6- phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl]-phenylpropionic acid (5 µmol), were com- bined in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dried under vacuum at room temperature. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were produced by resuspension of the lipid-probe mixture [0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.01 M 3-(N-morpholino)- propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) maintained over Chelex 100 resin] followed by 10 freeze-thaw cycles in a dry ice-EtOH bath and 2570 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 55, No. 7, 2007 Silva et al. extrusion (29 times) through a 100 nm pore size membrane. The final assay volume was 2 mL, consisting of 100 µL of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)- piperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer [50 mM HEPES and 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)], 200 µL of 1 M NaCl, 1.64 mL of N2-sparged Millipore purified water, 20 µL of test sample or DMSO (solvent control), and a 20-µL aliquot of liposome suspension. Peroxidation was initiated by addition of 20 µL of FeCl2· 4H2O (0.5 mM) to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM Fe2+. The positive controls BHA, BHT, and R-tocopherol/vitamin E were tested at a final concentration of 10 µM. Fluorescence was measured at 384 nm and monitored at 0, 1, and 3 min and every 3 min thereafter up to 21 min on a Turner model 450 digital fluorometer (Barnstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA). The decrease of relative fluorescence intensity with time indicated the rate of peroxidation. Relative fluorescence (Ft/F0) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence value at a given time t (Ft) by that at t ) 0 min (F0). Cyclooxygenase Enzymes Inhibitory Assay. COX-1 enzyme inhibi- tory assay was conducted with an enzyme preparation from ram seminal vesicles (ca. 0.46 mg of protein/mL in 30 mM Tris buffer, pH 7). COX-2 activity was determined by using a preparation from insect cell lysate and diluting with Tris buffer (pH 7) to give an approximate final concentration of 1.5 mg protein/mL (12, 13). COX assays were measured at 37 °C by observing the initial rate of O2 uptake with a micro oxygen chamber and electrode (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) attached to a YSI model 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instrument, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Each assay mix contained 0.6 mL of 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7), 1 mmol of phenol, and 17 µg of hemoglobin. For each test compound (100 ppm) or standards in DMSO (10 µL), activities were determined following a 2-10 min preincubation of samples with enzyme COX-1 or COX-2 (10-20 µL) in the assay chamber. Celebrex (1.7 ppm) and aspirin (108 ppm) were used as positive controls in this assay. Different concentra- tions of standards used were due to their difference in inhibitory activities and also to achieve a uniform enzyme inhibition at 50%. Reaction was initiated by adding arachidonic acid (10 µL of a 1.64 µM solution). Data were recorded with Quicklog for Windows data acquisition software (Strawberry Tree Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We have evaluated 158 Brazilian plant extracts by TLC for the presence of antioxidant compounds (unpublished data) by spraying the developed TLC plates with â-carotene solution followed by exposure to natural light (10). The results indicated the presence of antioxidants in 56 extracts, based on the observation of persistent yellow spots after exposure of the plates to natural light (10). These 56 plant extracts were then evaluated for their LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities. On the basis of the bioassay results, the methanol and hexane extracts of I. juruensis leaves and seeds, respectively, were selected for the isolation of bioactive compounds. In summary, the chro- matographic purification of the leaf-extract afforded 5-deoxy- flavones (1-5) and the seeds extract gave sargachromenol (6), sargaquinoic acid (7), the novel juruenolic acid (8), ω-arylal- kanoic acids (9a-c), and guaiacin (10). The identification of isolates was based mostly on NMR, UV, and MS spectral analysis and comparison with literature data. Compounds 1-5 belonged to the class of flavones lacking a 5-oxy substituent, which was confirmed by the signal at ca. δ 7.90 (d, J ∼8.0 Hz), assigned to H-5, in their 1H NMR spectra. The position of -OCH3 groups in flavones 3 and 4 was established by UV spectral analysis with NaOAc/MeOH and NaOMe/MeOH as shift reagents for determination of the substitution patterns in rings A (band I) and B (band II), respectively (14, 15). Also, the NMR data of these compounds were identical to the reported chemical shift values and further confirmed their identities. Therefore, compound 1 was identified as 7,4′-dimethoxyflavone and was formerly isolated from Virola, a widely occurring neotropical Myristicaceae genus (16), whereas compound 3 was identified as tithonine, previously isolated from Tithonia (Asteraceae) (17). Compounds 2 and 4, identified as fasciculiferin and farnisine, respectively, were reported from Acacia fasciculifera and Acacia farnesiana (Fabaceae) (18, 19). Similarly, compound 5 was identified as 7,4′-dihydroxyflavone, reported from Pterocarpus marsupium (20). The structures of sargachromenol (6) and sargaquinoic acid (7) were also confirmed by NMR and MS spectral analyses. These compounds have been isolated earlier from brown seaweeds from the genera Sargassum and Stipopodium (21, 22) and as repeated isolates from I. juruensis (7). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 8 showed signals for four methyl groups on sp2 carbons at δ 1.59, 1.62, 1.68, and 2.13, which showed correlations to signals at δ 17.7, 15.8, 25.6, and 29.9, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. A triplet at δ 5.98, integrated for one proton, and a multiplet at δ 5.09 for two protons were observed in its 1H NMR spectrum. The 13C NMR signal at δ 172.0, assigned to an R,â-unsaturated carboxyl, and at δ 123.0, 130.0, 132.0, 135.0, and 145.6, assigned to olefinic carbons of an isoprene chain, suggested a partial structure similar to the side chain in compounds 6 and 7. An Bioactive Constituents in Iryanthera juruensis J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 55, No. 7, 2007 2571 additional signal at δ 208.0, which showed HMBC correlation with the singlet at δ 2.13 and the triplet at δ 2.45, indicated a methyl-carbonyl-methylene moiety in the structure of 8 (Figure 1). Also, one quartet at δ 2.60, two triplets at δ 2.08 and 2.11, integrated for two protons each, and one multiplet at δ 2.26, integrated for four protons, were assigned to the allyl-methylene protons. The HMBC correlation between H1′ (δ 2.26) and C1 (COOH, δ 172.6), in addition to correlations of H8 (δ 2.27) to C6 (δ 130.6) and to C10 (CdO, δ 208.8) indicated the position of -COOH moiety at C2. Additional COSY (Figure 2) and HMBC correlations led to the complete assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR signals (Table 1). HRFABMS and FABMS analysis showed peaks at 293.2116 [M + H+] and 585 [2M + H+], respectively, which confirmed the molecular formula as C18H28O3, whereas peaks at m/z 69 and 165 in the FAB mass spectrum (positive ion mode) were assigned to the isopentenyl (C5H9) moiety and to the ion resulting from the loss of isopentenyl and carboxyl moieties [M - C5H9 - COOH]+, respectively. Therefore, the spectral data gave conclusive support to the establishment of the structure of the new compound 8 as 2-(4′-methylpentenyl-3)-10-oxoundecan-2,6-dienoic acid. ω-Arylalkanoic acids 9a-c were identified on the basis of their UV, 1H and 13C NMR, and FABMS spectra and are probably biosynthetic precursors of γ-lactones known as jurue- nolides, which occur widely in Iryanthera species (7, 23). Compound 10 was identified from its spectroscopic data and by comparison with literature values as guaiacin, an aryltetralin lignan, previously isolated from Guaiacum officinale (Zygo- phyllaceae) (24, 25). Flavonoids are by far the most investigated class of natural products regarding antioxidant properties. The aromatic -OH groups and the C2-C3 double bond are some of the features of flavonoids important for their antioxidant activity (26). Flavones 3-5 showed lipoperoxidation inhibition by 95% when tested at 100 ppm. At lower concentration (10 ppm), they were still highly active (Figure 3) and inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88%, respectively. This suggested that flavones 3-5 offer better protection of lipid membranes from oxidation than sargachromenol (6) or sargaquinoic acid (7). Flavones 1-5 also showed moderate inhibition of COX enzymes. However, the COX-1 enzyme was inhibited the most, by 40-65%, compared to COX-2 enzyme (Figure 4). At 100 ppm, flavones 1 and 2 inhibited COX-2 enzyme by 31% and 51%, respectively, whereas flavones 3-5 showed <20% inhibition. This activity profile might be dependent on their polarity as well as the substitution pattern in ring B. For example, flavones 1 and 2 are fully methoxylated compounds, whereas compounds 3-5 contained free -OH groups in their structures. Moreover, the substitution pattern in ring B seemed to play a major role in determining the COX-2 enzyme activity, as the presence of a 3′,4′-dimethoxy ring B rendered the highest enzyme inhibitory activity among flavones 1-5 tested. Also, lack of a methoxy group in ring B led to a reduction in the activity as shown by flavone 5. The presence of either a 7-OMe or 7-OH group in ring A seemed to be of lesser impact on COX-2 inhibition as shown by compounds 3 and 4, which showed similar activities. In previous studies, sargachromenol (6) was shown to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties that were assessed by electrochemical studies, by reaction with the stable free radical DPPH, and by inhibition of TPA-induced mouse ear edema (7, 27). In this paper, we present additional support of the biological activity of I. juruensis by demonstrating the ability of its isolates to inhibit LPO (76% at 100 ppm) (Figure 3) and COX-1 (98%) and COX-2 (84%) enzymes (Figure 4). In contrast, plastoquinone 7 exhibited poor inhibitory activities of LPO and COX-1 and -2 enzymes. This was probably due to Figure 1. Selected HMBC correlations for compound 8. Figure 2.

Poor inhibitory activities toward COX-1 and -2 enzymes were also observed for compounds 8 and 9. In contrast, arylalkanoic acid 9 inhibited LPO by 79%, whereas compound 8 showed much lower ability to protect liposomes from oxidation (Figure 3b). Guaiacin (10) presented the highest LPO inhibitory activity (>95% at 100 ppm) among the tested compounds from I. juruensis fruits. This was probably due to the presence of two veratryl moieties in its structure, which may increase the hydrogen radical donating ability of the aromatic hydroxyl groups. It also strongly inhibited COX-1 (75% at 100 ppm) enzyme but showed weak activity toward COX-2 (<20% at 100 ppm). The findings of our research on I. juruensis seeds and leaves have clearly shown that the plant parts studied possessed LPO inhibitory activity and were in agreement with the anecdotal reports. In addition, the moderate inhibition of COX-2 enzyme by extracts from seeds and leaves and the isolates from them further suggested the potential health beneficial effects of this plant and validated the ethno uses of I. juruensis decoction by Amazon Indians.

The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent, and the esters were significantly more effective than gallic acid. Gallic acid and its esters were compared with regard to their reactivity to free radicals, using the DPPH and AAPH/pyranine free- cell assays, and no significant difference was obtained. Gallic acid and its esters not only failed to inhibit the depletion of intracellular GSH in erythrocytes induced by AAPH but exacerbated it. Similarly, the oxidation of GSH by AAPH or horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in cell-free systems was exacerbated by gallic acid or gallates. This property could be involved in the recent findings on pro- apoptotic and pro-oxidant activities of gallates in tumor cells. We provide evidence that lipophilicity and not only radical scavenger potency is an important factor regarding the efficiency of anti- hemolytic substances. KEYWORDS: Gallic acid; gallates; erythrocytes; hemolysis; glutathione; peroxyl radical; antioxidant; pro-oxidant activity INTRODUCTION Gallic acid and its derivatives are among the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in wines and green tea (1-3). This phyto- chemical is well-known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti- inflammatory, antimutagenic, and chemopreventive properties (4-7). The similar beneficial effects of the synthetic esters of gallic acid have been extensively studied, and in many cases, they are stronger than those of gallic acid itself. For instance, lauryl gallate (dodecyl gallate), a widely used food additive, is more efficient than gallic acid as an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, and of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by FeIII-NADPH (8). Methyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid at inhibiting oral bacterial growth and the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms (4). Methyl gallate inhibits the production of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2 by bone-marrow-derived mast cells (9). Nonyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid against the growth of Salmonella choleraesuis (10). Lauryl gallate protects against the formationofdimethylbenzanthracene-inducedskintumorsinmice and kills, selectively, tumor cells in established tumors (11). Such biological activities have been correlated with the amphipathic feature of these ester derivatives (12), because the in vitro antioxi- dantpotentialisnearlythesameas thatofgallicacid. Hence, itmay be supposed that the accessibility of the gallates to the intracellular medium could be a determining factor for their effects. Another relevant property of gallates is their pro-oxidant characteristics. Indeed, the cytotoxic effect of octyl, dodecyl, and tetradecyl gallates on melanoma cells has recently been demonstrated (13, 14). This biological effect has been associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of NF-κB, inhibition of cell adhesion, and alteration of the cell redox status by depletion of both glutathione (GSH) and ATP (13). Similarly, the inhibition of HeLa cell growth by propyl gallate was associated with depletion of intracellular GSH and increased production of the superoxide anion (14). The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced disruption of cell membranes and the protective effect of antioxi- dants. One of the most frequently studied models uses the water- solubleazocompound2,20-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), which decomposes at physiological temperature (37 C) *To whom correspondence should be addressed: Departamento de Quı´mica, Faculdade de Ci^encias, UNESP, Bauru, SP, CEP 17033-360, Brazil.

In the presence of dissolved molecular oxygen, this radical is converted to the corresponding peroxyl radical (ROO•) (15). The mechanism of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by thermolysis of AAPH is not completely understood, but it has been correlated with lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins (16). The incubation of erythro- cytes with AAPH also provokes the depletion of intracellular GSH (17). Because the above biological phenomenon is associated with the disruption of the cell membrane and in view of increasing evidence that the lipophilicity of gallic acid esters is decisive for their beneficial effects, here, we aimed to synthesize selected gallate esters and compare their efficacy as inhibitors of AAPH- induced hemolysis and GSH depletion. The objective was to retain the same oxidizable moiety while altering the lipophili- city. Additionally, we studied and compared the antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of gallic acid and gallates in cell-free systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and Equipments. Gallic acid,vanillicacid,methylvanillate, (()-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), (()-R-tocopherol (vitamin E), 2,20-azobis(2- amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), 5,50-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), glutathione (GSH), 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (pyranine), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), N,N0- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, cumene hydroperoxide (Cu-OOH), horserad- ish peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1.7), and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was prepared bydiluting a 30% stock solution and calcul- ating its concentration from its absorption at 240 nm (ε240=43.6 M-1 cm-1) (18). Column chromatography was carried out over 0.06-0.20 mm silica gel (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). Gel permeation chromato- graphy (GPC) was performed with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out in a Varian Prep-Star 400 system with a Pheno- menex C-18 (250 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvents (Aldrich). All of the reagents used for buffers and mobile phases were analytical-grade. Stock solutions of antioxidants were prepared in ethyl alcohol. Ultrapure Milli-Q water from Millipore was used for the preparation of buffers and solutions. Gallic Acid Source. Gallic acid was extracted from Alchornea glandulosa. The leaves were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac-u, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen(SP319257) has beendeposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (S~ao Paulo, SP, Brazil). The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L 3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH/H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After solvent removal in a rotary evaporator, the partition phases yielded 2.5 and 0.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromato- graphed bygel permeation over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol, to afford 11 fractions (A1-A11). Second-stage chromatographic purifica- tion of fraction A2 (730 mg) by reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC (7.5:92:0.5 MeOH/H2O/HOAc, UV detection at 265 nm, and flow rate at 15 mL/min) yielded gallic acid (335 mg). The identification was based on analysis of 1H and 13C NMR data, as well as by a comparison to authentic material obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Synthesis of Esters (Methyl, Propyl, and Lauryl). A 3 mL solution of N,N0-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane was added to a cooled (5 C) solution of 0.2 mmol of gallic acid and 20 mmol of methyl, propyl, or lauryl alcohol in 6 mL of p-dioxane. After the solution was stirred for 48 h, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned 3 times with EtOAc and filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (3 times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (3 times), and water (2 times), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column eluted isocratically with CHCl3/MeOH (98:2). Structures of the semi-synthetic esters were estab- lished by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis. Erythrocyte Suspension. Human erythrocytes from healthy donors were obtained from peripheral blood, centrifuged at 770g for 10 min, and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. The supernatant and buffy coat were removed by aspiration after each wash. The cells were resuspended to 20% (v/v) in PBS. The blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers. The study was approved by the faculty research ethics committee. Hemolysis Assays. The hemolysis studies were performed as pre- viously described (19), with modifications. Equal amounts of erythrocytes suspension and 100 mM AAPH in PBS were gently homogenized while being incubated for 6 h at 37 C (blood tube rotator). Aliquots (75 μL) were removed at regular intervals, diluted 1:20 with PBS, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The degree of hemolysis was measured in the supernatant by its absorbance at 540 nm. Reference values (100% hemolysis) were determined with the same aliquot of erythrocytes but diluted in 1500 μL of distilled water instead of PBS to provoke the total lysis of the erythrocytes. By diluting the 100% hemolysis sample in PBS, a calibration curve of percent hemolysis against absorbance was constructed for conversion of the absorbance measurement to degrees of hemolysis. The blank was PBS, and measurements were made in a UV-1240 spectro- photometer (Shimadzu, Japan). When used, 10 μL aliquots of inhibitors in ethanol were added at the beginning of the reaction. The same volume of ethyl alcohol (10 μL) was added to the negative (without AAPH) and positive (with AAPH) controls. In the studies where cumene hydroper- oxide (Cu-OOH) was the hemolytic agent, this compound (500 μM) was used instead of AAPH. Determination of Intracellular GSH. The intracellular concentra- tion of GSH in erythrocytes was determined using the DTNB method (19), with modifications. The 20% suspension of erythrocytes (100 μL) was incubated with 100 μL of 50 mM AAPH at 37 C for 2.0 h. After incubation, the suspension was diluted to 1000 μL with PBS and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was lysed by adding 700 μL of distilled H2O. The protein in 700 μL of lysate was precipitated by adding 500 μL of an aqueous solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After 5 min, the protein precipitate was separated from the remaining solution by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (500 μL) was made alkaline by adding 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 62.5 μL of NaOH (1 M). Next, 450 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 100 μL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate) were added to 450 μL of the alkaline mixture. In the blank, 500 μL of supernatant was mixed with 250 μL of PBS instead of 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 and 62.5 μL of NaOH, after which 450 μL of PBS and 100 μL of DTNB were added to 450 μL of this mixture. Each sample test or control had its blank. The absorbance was read at 412 nm. A standard curve was constructed to measure the concentration of GSH. In this case, 700 μL of lysate was replaced by 700 μL of solutions of GSH at several concentrations. The hemoglobin content (Hb) in an aliquot of the lysate (prior precipitation with TCA) was determined by the cyanohemoglobin method. The GSH values were expressed as μmol/g Hb (20). Oxidation of GSH by AAPH. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 2.5 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C for 1.0 h (21). When present,gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added beforethe addition of AAPH. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured bythe DTNB method as follows: 0.45 mL of the reaction mixture was added to 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.1 mL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate). The absorbance at 412 nm was read against a blank consisting of 0.45 mL of PBS, 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.1 mL of DTNB. An analytical curve was produced using standard GSH solutions, which were submitted to the DTNB methods. Oxidation of GSH by HRP/H2O2. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at 37 C (21). When present, gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured by the DTNB method as above. Measurement of GSH and GSSG by HPLC. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at Article J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5357 37 C. When present, apocynin, gallic acid, and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The concentration of GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection, as previously described (22): For GSH determination, 50 μL of the above reaction mixture was added to 1.0 mL of 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. To a 20 μL aliquot of this mixture, 300 μL of 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0 and 20 μL of 0.1% OPA in methanol were added and this reaction mixture was incubated at 25 C for 15 min in the dark in well-capped tubes, after which 20μL ofeachsamplewas injectedintothe HPLCsystem. For GSSG determination, a 200 μL aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 C with 200 μL of 40 mM NEM, for 25 min, in the dark, to react with the GSH present in the sample. To this mixture, 750 μL of 0.1 M NaOH was added. A 20 μL portion of this mixture was taken for measurement of GSSG, using the procedure outlined above for the GSH assay, except that 0.1 M NaOH was employed as the diluent rather than 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. The HPLC method for the determination of GSH and GSSG is based on derivatization with OPA to form a stable, highly fluorescent derivative (23). The derivatives of GSH and GSSG were separated by liquid chromatography (Varian ProStar in line with a fluorescence detector set at 350/420 nm). The analyses were carried out isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of 15% methanol in 25 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 6.0 (flow rate of 0.5 mL/min). Measurement of Oxygen Consumption. The consumption of dis- solved molecular oxygen during the oxidation of GSH was monitored in a YSI 5300A oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring, OH). The reaction mixture of 1 mM GSH, 100 μM H2O2, and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS was incubated at 37 C in the presence or absence (control) of 10 μM apocynin or gallates. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. The oxygen consumption was monitored for 10 min. Pyranine-Based Procedure for Evaluation of the Reactivity of Gallates with Peroxyl Radicals Generated by AAPH Thermolysis. This experiment was performed as described by Lissi et al. (24), with minor modifications. The experiments were based on the decay in the fluores- cence of pyranine when it was submitted to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compound pyranine (5 μM) was incubated with 20 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C in the absence (control) or presence of gallates in the wells of a microplate. The fluorescence bleaching of the pyranine was monitored at λex=460 nm and λem=510 nm in a Spectramax M2 micro- plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The final reaction volume was 300 μL. The lag phase (induction time) obtained when the antioxidants were present was measured for various concentrations of each gallate. The slopes of the curves of induction time versus concentra- tion were used to measure the relative reactivity of the gallates with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. Free-Radical Scavenging Activity on DPPH/DPPH Bleaching Assay. The free-radical scavenger activity of gallic acid and its esters was compared by the DPPH bleaching assay (25). The antioxidants were incubated for 30 min with 100 μM DPPH in methyl alcohol in the dark. The scavenger activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm, using the absorbance of the unreacted DPPH radical as the control. The scavenger activity was calculated as ((absorbance of the control - absorbance of the sample)/absorbance of the control) 100. RESULTS We studied the hemolysis of erythrocytes and the protective effect of gallic acid and its esters. The molecular structures of the compounds studied are shown in Figure 1. Hemolysis was provoked by thermolysis of the azo compound AAPH, which generates a low but constant flux of peroxyl radicals when incubated at 37 C (15). Figure 2 shows the kinetic profile of hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid and propyl gallate. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent (Figure 3), and the esters methyl gallate (G1), propyl gallate (G3), and lauryl gallate (G12) were more effective inhibitors than their acid precursor, gallic acid (G0) (Table 1). Because the above results suggest a higher efficacy of the esters as free-radical scavengers, we also compared their relative potency in cell-free models. First, they were compared as scav- engers of the stable free-radical DPPH. The results depicted in Table 2 show that no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its ester derivatives. In a second set of experiments, we studied the direct reactivity of gallic acid and its esters with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. In this assay, the relative reactivity of the antioxidants with peroxyl radicals is determined by the lag phase in the decay of pyranine fluorescence (24). Figure 4 shows the typical time profile of the bleaching obtained when pyranine was incubated with AAPH in the presence of gallic acid and methyl gallate. The linear relation between the delay and the concentration of gallic acid or gallates was used to measure the reactivity of the tested compound with AAPH. In this design, the slope of the curve is directly proportional to the efficiency of the antioxidant as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals. Figure 4 also shows the typical linear correlation between the concentration and lag phase for gallic acid and methyl gallate. The slopes obtained were 442 ( 30 for gallic acid, 499 ( 31 for methyl gallate, 453 ( 6 for propyl gallate, and 187 ( 7 for lauryl gallate (mean ( SEM, n = 3). As can be observed, only lauryl gallate presented a Figure 1. Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study. Figure 2.

Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 Ximenes et al. decreased reactivity with peroxyl radicals in this experimental model. Considering the above cell-free studies, the stronger antihemo- lytic effect of the gallates, relative to that of gallic acid, suggests that lipophilicity is a determining factor in this experimental model. To verify this proposal, we also compared the antioxidant vanillic acid versus its methyl ester (methyl vanillate) and trolox, a morewater-soluble form ofvitamin E,versusvitamin E itself. The results with these two different classes of antioxidants followed the same pattern as that for gallates and gallic acid, reinforcing the suggestion that lipophilicity of antioxidants is crucial with respect to antihemolytic protection (Table 1). The direct hemolytic capacity of gallic acid and gallates was also investigated, because these compounds could interact with and disrupt the erythrocyte membrane. In these experiments, gallic acid and gallates were incubated with erythrocytes with- out AAPH. The results in Table 3 show that only the 12-carbon ester lauryl gallate caused significant hemolysis after incubation for 6 h. The protective effect of gallates was not restricted to AAPH- induced hemolysis. The results given in Table 4 show that gallates were also effective when the hemolysis was provoked by incuba- tion of erythrocytes with cumene hydroperoxide. Again, there was a correlation with lipophilicity. In a further experiment, the protective effect of gallic acid and gallates on the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by AAPH was also studied. Despite their antihemolytic properties, gallic acid and gallates were unable to inhibit the oxidation of GSH when erythrocytes were incubated with AAPH. On the contrary, the depletion of GSH was exacerbated by methyl and lauryl gallates (Table 5). To clarify these findings, we studied the direct reaction between pure GSH and AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and tested the effect of gallic acid and gallates on this reaction. Again, the presence of gallic acid and gallates tended to exacerbate the oxidation of GSH (Figure 5). In another set of experiments, pure GSH was oxidized by H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by HRP. Because GSH is a poor substrate for peroxidase, the efficiency of oxidation was low (26). However, the addition of gallic acid and gallates caused a strong increase in the oxidation of GSH (Figure 6). It is well-known that some phenolic compounds are able to act as a co-catalyst in reactions of inefficient peroxidase substrates, such as GSH. In such situations, the oxidized intermediate phenolic radical is reduced back and GSH is converted to GSSG. Moreover, during this redox cycle, the dissolved molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture is consumed, being reduced to superoxide anion (27). For these reasons and in light of our results, we measured the production of GSSG and the oxygen consumption as GSH was oxidized by HRP/H2O2 in the presence of gallic acid or gallates. To ascertain whether our experimental conditions for assessing the co-catalytic effectof phenols upon the oxidation of GSH was correct, we used apocynin, which is able to initiate this process, as a reference compound (28). As can be seen in Figure 7, both gallic acid and apocynin exacerbated the oxidation of GSH; however, only in the presence of apocynin was GSSG obtained as a product. Similarly, only in the presence of apocynin was the consumption of dissolved oxygen observed (Figure 8). The other gallates showed the same results as gallic acid (data not shown). DISCUSSION The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model in the study of ROS-induced disruption of cell membranes. The inhibitory property of many antioxidants upon AAPH-induced hemolysis is well-documented (29-32). However, there is no clear relationship between the molecular structure of the antioxidants and their efficiency as inhibitors. Here, working with gallic acid and its ester derivatives, we found Figure 3. Concentration-dependent effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3) on AAPH-induced hemolysis. The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C. The results are mean ( SEM of duplicates of three separate experiments.

Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5359 that lipophilicity seems to be an essential characteristic of an efficient antihemolytic compound. Similar findings were reported by Wu et al. that ranked the antihemolytic efficiency of gallates as propyl > ethyl > methyl (33). Corroborating this proposal, the correlation between efficacy against AAPH-induced hemolysis and lipophilicity was not restricted to gallic acid and its ester derivatives but extended to other classes of molecules, such as vanillic acid versus its lipophilic derivative methyl vanillate and trolox versus vitamin E. Moreover, the benefit of lipophilicity was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis, because it was also seen when the erythrocytes were challenged with cumene hydro- peroxide. Reinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, our result showed clearly that higher antihemolytic efficacy of the gallates was not related to their oxidizability. Indeed, except for lauryl gallate, no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its esters in their potential as antioxidants in cell-free systems. Only the 12-carbon chain ester was relatively poor as a peroxyl radical scavenger in the cell-free systems. Despite that and again reinfor- cing the importance of lipophilicity, lauryl gallate was a more efficient inhibitor of hemolysis than gallic acid. It is important to observe that any compound used as an antihemolytic agent when erythrocytes are challenged by free Figure 4.

This effect has been described, and there is a relationship between lipophilicity and hemolytic capacity deve- loped by many compounds (34, 35). Accordingly, lauryl gallate, the most lipophilic compound used in this study, was the only ester capable of inducing hemolysis of erythrocytes under our experimental conditions. Other important findings include the interaction of gallic acid and gallates with GSH. This chemical feature could explain or be involved in the recent findings about cellular pro-oxidant effects of gallates (13, 14). This tripeptide is the main endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) reflects directly the redox status of the cell (36). It is well-known that redox homeostasis is crucial for cells to survive, and the pathophysiological mecha- nisms ofseveral diseasesare related tothe exacerbated production of ROS and/or decreased antioxidant functions (37). In fact, apoptosis, which is altered in tumor cells, strongly depends upon the GSH/GSSG ratio (38, 39). Two pathways could explanation the exacerbated oxidation of GSH whengallates are present in the reaction mixture or cellular medium. The first is the action of these compounds as co-catalysts, where the intermediate pheno- xyl radical would be reduced back to gallate with concomitant oxidation of GSH. This phenomenon is well-established for phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine and apocynin (27, 28), and the consequence of this redox cycle is the consumption of GSH, the formation of GSSG, and the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion (40). This was exactly what we observed for apocynin, used as a model for a comparison to gallates in this study. However, when gallates were used, the consumption of GSH was not followed by the formation of GSSG and the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Hence, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for the augmented depletion of GSH caused by gallic acid and gallates. The second possible explanation for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates in the depletion of intracellular GSH is a chemical reaction between the oxidized trihydroxybenzene moi- ety, probably in its quinone form, and GSH via the Michael Figure 5.

This is a well-known reaction that involves electrophilic quinones and nucleophilic substances, such as GSH, leading to thiol adducts (41,42). In this case, the consumption of GSH is not followed by the formation of GSSG and oxygen consumption, as verified here. In summary, Scheme 1 shows our proposal for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates when these compounds were oxidized in the presence of GSH, which could explain the depletion of intracellular GSH as verified here and by others (13, 14).

The leaves afforded three glabretal-type triterpene derivatives esterified by N-methylanthranilic acid (3-5). Compounds 1 and 2 displayed weak inhibitory activity when assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Compounds 1-5 were inactive in a brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality test. Raulinoa is a monospecific genus, and the species Raulinoa echinata Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic to the Itajaı´ Valley, Santa Catarina, Brazil.1 This perennial woody shrub is characterized by the presence of spines and has been found only in a restricted location (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks of the Itajaı´ River at an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing a high degree of adaptation to the environment. In continuation of our research on the chemistry of Raulinoa echinata,2,3 inves- tigation of methanol extracts of stems and leaves has led to the isolation of the new 21R,25-dimethylmelianodiol (1) and 21â,25-dimethylmelianodiol (2) and also three new N-methylanthranilic acid esters of the glabretal-type com- pounds 3-5. In this work, the isolated compounds were also assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and in the brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality test. The hexane extract of the stems of R. echinata yielded the triterpenes melianone and melianodiol, which exhibited spectral data in agreement with the literature.4,5 The hemiacetal ring of these compounds opens and closes in solution; thus, a mixture of epimers is always present. From the methanol extract compounds of R. echinata stems 1 and 2 were obtained. As shown previously for melianone and melianodiol, these compounds exhibited resonances in their 1H NMR spectra at ca. δ 5.30 (brd, J ) 3.0), ascribable to H-7, and seven singlets for quaternary methyl groups between δ 0.82 and 1.25. Resonances at δ 216.7, 145.6/145.3, and 118.1/118.0 were assigned to C-3, C-8, and C-7, respectively, in the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 2. In contrast to melianone or melianodiol, two methoxyl group signals were observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2. The side chain in each case was found to be the 21,- 25-dimethoxy analogue of melianodiol, as verified by het- eronuclear correlations of the methoxyl groups with C-21 and C-25 in the HMBC spectra of 1 and 2. The HSQC spectra of compounds 1 and 2 showed correlations of the C-21 group resonances at δ 109.7 and 104.7 with H-21 [at δ 4.79 and δ 4.68 d (J ) 3.4 Hz) for 1 and 2, respectively], characterizing them as C-21 epimers. The H-23 [4.16 ddd (J ) 7.3, 5.4, 2.9 Hz)] and C-23 (δ 75.1) resonances, in addition to the H-24 (3.37 brd) and C-24 (δ 76.4) signals, showed correlations in the HSQC spectrum of compound 1. The isomer 2 showed the same correlations but inverted chemical shifts for C-23 (δ 77.8) and C-24 (δ 76.7). Additional information was obtained by HMBC and NOE difference NMR experiments. In the HMBC spectra, cor- relations for C-25 (δ 77.2) and H-26/27 (δ 1.15 and 1.25) for compound 1, and at δ 77.7 with 1.18 and 1.25 for compound 2, were observed. The H-18 (δ 0.82) signal in the HMBC spectrum of compound 1 correlated with C-12 (δ 31.1), C-13 (δ 43.6), C-14 (δ 51.0), and C-17 (δ 50.7). For compound 2, H-18 showed the same correlations, but the chemical shift of C-17 was upfield (δ 44.9). This difference was attributed to a γ-gauche effect of the oxygenated substituent on C-21â. Nakanishi et al.5 performed the X-ray crystallographic analysis of a melianone acetate analogue, comparing chemical shifts of R- and â-melianone acetates. According to their findings, C-21 exhibited downfield shifts and C-23 showed upfield shifts, in the C-21R epimer. These arguments were confirmed by NOE difference experiments for 1 and 2 (Table 3).

This enhancement was not observed for OMe-21 of compound 2. Accordingly, the structures of 1 and 2 were assigned as 21R,25-dimethylmelianodiol- [(21R,23R)epoxy-24-hydroxy-21R,25-methoxy]tirucalla-7- en-3-one and 21â,25-dimethylmelianodiol[(21S,23R)epoxy- 24-hydroxy-21â,25-dimethoxy]tirucalla-7-en-3-one, respect- ively. Compound 3 exhibited a pair of doublets (one hydrogen each), at δ 0.49 (J ) 5.0 Hz) and 0.74 (J ) 5.0 Hz), in the COSY NMR spectrum. In the HSQC NMR spectrum, these hydrogens correlated with a methylene carbon at δ 13.4, indicating a 14,18-cycloapoeuphane skeleton. The side chain of compound 3 was assigned as a methylmelianodiol- type unit, as evidenced by resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum at δ 4.84 [(d, J ) 3.0 Hz), H-21], 4.04 [(ddd, J ) 10.2, 4.8, 2.0 Hz), H-23], 3.51 [(d, J ) 5.0 Hz), H-24], and 3.36 s (OMe-21).6 The H-21 signal correlated in the HSQC spectrum with C-21 at δ 108.5, suggesting a C-21R-methoxy carbon, as in the case of 1. In the HMBC spectrum, H-21 correlated with C-23 (δ 77.6) and C-20 (δ 49.5), while H-23 and H-24 correlated in the HSQC spectrum with oxyme- thine carbons at δ 77.6 and 77.9, respectively. A broad singlet at δ 3.76 indicated a H-7â substituent,6 correlating in the HSQC spectrum with a carbon at δ 74.1. In the HMBC spectrum, the H-7â signal correlated with methine carbons at δ 43.8 (C-9) and 46.1 (C-5). The former showed correlations with singlets attributed to H-30 (δ 1.03) and H-19 (δ 0.93); the latter correlated with H-28 and H-29 (δ 1.00/0.92), respectively. The HREIMS of compounds 3-5 revealed an odd molecular weight, in each case indicating the presence of nitrogen in these molecules. A 3â-N- methylanthranilate group was indicated in the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 3-5 by the resonances at δ 4.70 (dd, J ) 11.1 and 5.0 Hz for 3 and 4; J ) 10.3 and 5.8 Hz for 5) corresponding to H-3R, which correlated in their HSQC spectra with an oxymethine carbon (δ 80.4 ( 0.1). Com- pound 3 exhibited aromatic signals at δ 7.90 (dd, J ) 8.0, 1.6 Hz), 7.31 (ddd, J ) 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz), 6.65 (brd, J ) 8.0 Hz), and 6.58 (ddd, J ) 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz). In addition, doublets at δ 7.70 (br, J ) 4.6 Hz, N-H) and 2.90 (J ) 4.6 Hz, N-Me) were observed in the COSY spectra, consistent with a N-methylanthranilic acid ester. Similar features were observed for compounds 4 and 5 (Table 1).

Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2002, Vol. 65, No. 4 563 The N-Me hydrogens correlated in the HMBC spectra of 3 with the quaternary carbon at δ 152.0 (C-3′), which showed correlations with the signals at δ 7.90 (H-7′) and 7.31 (H-5′). The carbonyl C-1′ (δ 168.2) correlated with H-7′ (δ 131.3). In the COSY spectrum coupling between H-7′/ H-6′ and H-5′/H-4′ was observed. Accordingly, compound 3 was assigned as (21R,23S)-epoxy-21R-methoxy-7R,24,25- trihydroxy-4R,4â,8â,10â-tetramethyl-25-dimethyl-14,18-cy- clo-5R,13R,14R,17R-cholestan-3â-N-methylanthranilic acid ester. Compound 4 differed from compound 3 only in the configuration of C-21, with chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra observed for the hydrogens of the side chain along with upfield changes for carbons C-21, C-17, and C-16, in agreement with a â-configuration, as discussed earlier for 2. Compound 4 was assigned the structure (21R,- 23S)-epoxy-21R-methoxy-7R,24,25-trihydroxy-4R,4â,8â,10â- tetramethyl-25-dimethyl-14,18-cyclo-5R,13R,14R,17R- cholestan-3â-N-methylanthranilic acid ester. Compound 5 was also assigned an N-methylanthranilic acid ester with a 14,18-cycloapoeuphane skeleton, but did not exhibit a methoxyl singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance was observed downfield (δ 5.28) when compared to the methoxylated derivatives 3 and 4. Ad- ditionally, the signals for the side chain of compound 5 were duplicated in the 1H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance showed a second doublet (of minor intensity) at δ 5.32, multiplets at δ 4.40 and 4.23 attributed to H-23, and doublets at δ 3.58 and 3.13 assigned to H-24. These observations strongly suggested that 5 is a C-21 hydroxyl derivative, isolated as an epimeric mixture.6,7 As for compounds 1-4, compound 5 was finally elucidated by a series of 2D NMR experiments, including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. NMR spectral data for compounds 1-5 are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the main H-C correlations in the long-range HMBC spectrum of 5. Thus, the structure of 5 was assigned as (21,23S)-epoxy-7R,21,- 24,25-tetrahydroxy-4R,4â,8â,10â-tetramethyl-25-dimethyl- 14,18-cyclo-5R,13R,14R,17R-cholestan-3â-N-methylanthra- nilic acid ester. Methoxylated protolimonoids were described previously from Turraea holstii (Meliaceae).8 It is possible that the methoxylated compounds 1-4 are artifacts of the extrac- tion process. Protolimonoids of the melianone-type and compounds with the 14,18-cycloapoeuphane-type skeleton have been found mainly in species of the Meliaceae, but were also found in some Rutaceae species. The former group was encountered from Phellodendron chinense9 and the latter from Skimmia japonica.10 Benzoyl,6 cinamoyl,6 tigloyl,7,11 acetyl,11,12 and isobutyryl13 ester acids of glabre- tal triterpenes at C-3 have been reported in the literature, with all exhibiting the R-configuration. However, 3â-N- methylanthranilic acid esters of glabretal-type triterpenes seem to be unprecedented in the literature. Compounds 1-5 were assayed in vitro against the trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed weak activity against the trypomastigote form (Y strain) of T. cruzi with IC50 values of 134.9 and 114.5 µg/mL, respectively, when compared with the refer- ence compound crystal violet (IC50 7.5 µg/mL). Compounds 3-5 were inactive in this assay, with IC50 values of > 1000 µg/mL. Compounds 1-5 were all inactive in the brine shrimp lethality test (LD50 > 100 µg/mL). Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were determined on a Microquı´mica MQAPF-301 instrument and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. UV spectra were determined with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. IR spectra were taken on a Bomem Hartman & Braun MB- Series instrument. A Bruker DRX-400 NMR spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C, was used. All spectra were run in CDCl3 with TMS as internal standard. For HREIMS an Autospec-Micromass-EBE was used (Universidade Estadual de Campinas). Plant Material. Stems and leaves of R. echinata were collected in Ressacada, Ibirama, SC, Brazil, and identified by A. Reis (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo). A voucher specimen [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] has been deposited at the Herba´rio Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaı´, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered stems (5 kg) and leaves (3 kg) were extracted with hexane and MeOH. Then, half (100 g) of the MeOH extract was fraction- ated over silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) into three fractions: CH2- Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The latter fraction (89 g) was dissolved in H2O-MeOH and successively partitioned with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane, CH2Cl2, and EtOAc). A portion of the ethyl acetate fraction (2 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent hexane-acetone (75:25 and then a gradient of the same solvent of increasing polari- ties), furnishing fractions A to I. Fraction A (460 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) affording several triterpenes. Among them, a mixture of compounds 1 and 2 (7 mg) was purified over a Lobar Lichroprep [(Merck) Si 60 (40-63 µm) B (310-25)] column, using hexane-acetone (95:5) as eluent, affording 1 (3.6 mg) and 2 (3.2 mg). From the hexane extract of stems, significant amounts of melianone (350 mg) and melianodiol (150 mg) were obtained using column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh) and using as eluent hexane-acetone in gradient.3 Table 3.

The hexane (15 g) and CH2Cl2 fractions (10 g) obtained were chromatographed over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using solvents of increasing polarity: hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. A fraction eluted by CH2Cl2 (1.7 g) from the hexane fraction yielded compounds 4 (39 mg) and 5 (44 mg) using column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh) and hexane-acetone (9:1) for elution. The EtOAc (1.5 g) fraction from the CH2Cl2 fraction yielded compound 3 (50 mg) with the same solvent mixture above. 21r,25-Dimethylmelianodiol[(21R,23R)epoxy-24-hy- droxy-21r,25-methoxy]tirucalla-7-en-3-one (1): colorless gum; [R]25D -65.2° (c 0.02, CHCl3); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 204 (2.95), 248 (2.42) nm; IR (film) νmax 2920, 1707, 1458, 1375, 1083 cm-1; 1H NMR data, see Table 1; 13C NMR data, see Table 2; EIMS m/z 389 (26), 359 (8), 307 (41), 239 (10), 199 (11), 161 (100), 135 (23), 131 (11) 119 (10); HREIMS m/z 516.38151 (calcd for C32H52O5, 516.38147). 21â,25-Dimethylmelianodiol[(21S,23R)epoxy-24-hy- droxy-21â,25-dimethoxy]tirucalla-7-en-3-one (2): colorless gum; [R]25D -103.0° (c 0.02, CHCl3); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 209 (3.37), 244 (2.89) nm; IR (film) νmax 2920, 1707, 1458, 1375, 1083 cm-1; 1H NMR data, see Table 1; 13C NMR data, see Table 2; EIMS m/z 389 (30), 359 (10), 307 (30), 239 (10), 199 (15), 161 (100), 135 (20), 131 (8), 119 (5); HREIMS m/z 516.38148 (calcd for C32H52O5, 516.38147).

Their chemical structures were assigned on the basis of MS and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Xanthones 1-6 showed moderate free radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as well as antioxidant activity evidenced by redox properties measured on ElCD-HPLC. As part of our bioprospecting program Biota-FAPESP (The Virtual Institute of Biodiversity), whose main goal is to discover potential antitumoral, antifungal, and antioxi- dant agents from plants of the Cerrado and Atlantic forest, we have screened hundreds of plants collected in the State of Sa˜o Paulo. Among these, Arrabidaea samydoides was chosen for detailed chemical investigation due to prior antioxidant activity revealed on a TLC autographic assay sprayed with â-carotene solution, and to our knowledge there are no previous reports on chemical and biological studies. This species belongs to the family Bignoniaceae, which contains about 120 genera and 800 species distrib- uted throughout tropical regions of South America and Africa.1 Species from the genus Arrabidaea have been used in traditional medicine for wound asepsis and treating intestinal disorders.2 In northeast Brazil, Arrabidaea chica is used in tattoos by Indians due to the pigments carajurin and carajurone.2,3 A literature review indicated that this genus is a source of anthocyanins, flavonoids, and tannins.3-7 The ethanolic extract from the stems showed promising antioxidant activity and led to the isolation of three new C-glucopyranosylxanthones, 2-(2′-O-trans-caffeoyl)-C-â-D- glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone (1), 2-(2′- O-trans-cinnamoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahy- droxyxanthone (2), and 2-(2′-O-trans-coumaroyl)-C-â-D- glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone (3), and the known mangiferin (4),8 2-(2′-O-benzoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyra- nosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone (5),9 and muraxan- thone (6).10 In this paper, we report the isolation, structure elucidation, and antioxidant properties of these C-glucopy- ranosylxanthones. Compounds 4 and 6 were identified by comparison with previously published NMR and other physical data.8,10 Compound 5 was described previously as a mixture of three isomers from Hymenophyllum recurvum.9 Only a few 13C NMR data were analyzed and discussed. In this paper we describe the complete 1H, 13C NMR and ES-MS/MS data for this compound. Compound 1 was shown to have the molecular formula C28H23O14 [M - H]- m/z 583.1008, by analysis of the negative-ion HRESIMS. The IR spectrum showed bands at 3370, 1615, and 1474 cm-1 accounting for hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic groups, respectively. The 13C NMR spectrum showed six signals for hydroxy- methine carbons, suggesting the presence of a sugar moiety, and 22 signals for sp2 carbons, which could be assigned to three aromatic rings, and also two carbonyls and one additional olefinic function. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1, a caffeoyl moiety was identified by signals at δ 6.79 (1H, d, J ) 2.0 Hz, H-2′′), 6.58 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5′′), and 6.67 (1H, br d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-6′′), * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Prod. 2003, 66, 1384-1387 10.1021/np030100t CCC: $25.00 © 2003 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 09/24/2003 along with the olefinic protons in a trans arrangement at δ 7.23 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-7′′) and 5.93 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-8′′). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum also dis- played singlets at δ 7.22, 6.61, and 6.15, which showed correlation with signals at δ 109.1, 103.4, and 95.0, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. These data, analyzed with their corresponding 13C NMR data (Table 2), and further information from ESI-MS/MS (m/z 405), and ana- logues published in the literature,10 suggested a xanthone skeleton linked to a caffeoyl-glucose moiety for compound 1. TOCSY experiments showed a complete sequence of five correlated signals of the sugar moiety at δ 3.4-3.9. In addition a doublet at δ 5.01 (J ) 10.0 Hz) and one multiplet at δ 5.58 were assigned to H-1′ and H-2′, respectively, on the basis of COSY, 13C NMR, and HMQC spectral analysis. The unusual downfield chemical shift of the H-2′ signal suggested an acyl moiety at C-2′,12 which was corroborated by the values from C-1′, C-2′, and C-3′ (Table 2) and observation of a cross-peak between the H-2′ and C-9′′ (δ 168.3) signals in the HMBC spectrum. Additional correla- tions between H-1′ (δ 5.01) and C-1 (δ 162.8), C-2 (δ 106.0), and C-3 (δ 165.0) evidenced the linkage of the glucose moiety at C-2. This spectrum also showed correlations of the signals at δ 6.15 (H-4) to C-2 (δ 106.0), C-3 (δ 165.0), C-4a (δ 158.8), and C-9a (δ 102.9); δ 6.61 (H-5) to C-10a (δ 153.0), C-6 (δ 155.3), C-7 (δ 144.8), and C-8a (δ 113.6), and δ 7.22 (H-8) to C-10a (δ 153.0), C-6 (δ 155.3), C-7 (δ 144.8), C-9a (δ 102.9), and C-9 (δ 181.1), supporting the substitu- tion pattern proposed for the aglycone. The UV spectra recorded in MeOH and shift reagents (AlCl3, HCl, KOH, NaOAc, and H3BO3) confirmed the presence of free hydroxy groups at C-1 and C-3 and an ortho-dihydroxylation pattern for the B ring of compound 1.11 Finally, the positive-ion electrospray tandem mass spectra ESI(+)-MS/MS (Table 3) completely established the proposed structure for 1. The fragment at m/z 585 (a) is rather simple and structurally characteristic, as it shows two major fragment ions of m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), which can be clearly related to the proposed C-glucosylxanthone, as well as the fragment at m/z 163 (d), confirming the caffeoyl moiety for this xan- thone. Compound 2 was assigned the empirical formula C28H23O12, [M - H]- m/z 551.1241, by accurate negative- ion HRESIMS. The UV and IR spectra were nearly identi- cal to those obtained for 1. Direct comparison of 1H data (Table 1) of 1 and 2 showed that the signals for the caffeoyl moiety from 1 were replaced in 2 by a pair of multiplets at δ 7.56 and 7.34. The hydrogens corresponding to the two olefinic protons were similar and appeared as doublets with a coupling constant of 15.5 Hz at δ 7.39 (H-7′′) and 6.37 (H-8′′), revealing a cinnamoyl moiety with a trans stereo- chemistry.

The ESI(+)-MS/ MS tandem mass spectrum of the protonated ion at m/z 553 (a) was analyzed and also corroborated the proposed structure for this compound (Table 3). It showed two major ion fragments at m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), which revealed the C-glucosylxanthone backbone, whereas the unique acylium ion fragment at m/z 131 (d) corroborated the cinnamoyl group. Compound 3 was assigned the molecular formula C28H23O12, [M - H]- m/z 567.1183, by accurate negative- ion HRESIMS. The UV and IR spectra were very similar to those of 1 and 2. A comparison of the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 3 with those of 1 revealed that the only noticeable difference was related to the aromatic moiety substituent at C-2′. The caffeoyl moiety in 1 was replaced by a coumaroyl residue in compound 3. The coumaroyl moiety was evidenced in the 1H NMR spectrum by two doublets at δ 7.18 (2H, J ) 8.0 Hz) and 6.61 (2H, J ) 8.0 Hz), characteristic of an AA′XX′ system, and by two olefinic protons in a trans arrangement at δ 7.29 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-7′′) and 5.99 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-8′′). These data were also supported by 13C NMR (Table 2) and mass spectral data. The ESI(+)-MS/MS tandem mass spectrum of the protonated ion at m/z 569 (a) registered for 3 is also diagnostic for a xanthone with these characteristic features (Table 3). The distinct peaks showed the common and major C-glucosylxanthone fragment ions at m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), whereas the unique acylium ion fragment at m/z 147 (d) confirmed the coumaroyl moiety. The scavenging effects obtained for compounds 1-6 are shown in Table 5. Compounds 1 and 3 showed the best scavenging activities, taking as the reference the flavonoid rutin (IC50 12.34 µg/mL), revealing a moderate antioxidant activity, while compounds 6, 2, and 5 showed lower activities and similar IC50 values. This result indicates that the moderate free radical scavenging activity of the xan- thones is due to their hydrogen-donating ability, so in- creasing the number of hydroxyls or catechol groups results in a more efficient radical scavenging effect.13 The electro- chemical behavior displayed by these compounds showed a good correlation with the radical scavenging effect measured in the DPPH assay. This observation clearly indicates that substances with oxidative peaks below +1.2 V (Table 5) and a large oxidative capacity have more promising radical scavenging properties than those that are oxidized at higher potentials.14 Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were determined at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin- Elmer 1710 spectrometer and a Perkin-Elmer UV-vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on a Micro- quimica MQAPF-301. 1H and 13C NMR spectra and gHMBC and gHMQC, gCOSY, and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive- and negative-ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-resolution orthogonal time-of-flight (o-TOF) configuration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 µL/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH-H2O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/MS spectra of mass-selected ions were acquired using 10-20 eV collisions with argon. For column chromatog- raphy purification, RP-18 (230-400 mesh, Merck) and Sepha- dex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used as solid supports. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisaldehyde 5% in H2SO4 followed by heating. Scavenging activities were mea- sured using a Varian Star 9090 ElCD composed of a glassy carbon working electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A Rheodyne injector, with a 20 µL loop and a Varian 210 HPLC pump as solvent delivery module, was used. Separation of the micromolecules was carried out on a Phenomenex ODS LUNA, 5 µm (250 × 4.60 mm) column. The isocratic phase used was MeOH-H2O (85:15) (HPLC grade, Mallinckrodt, and ultrapure water, obtained by passing redistilled water through a Milli-Q system, Millipore). All separations were carried out at 30 °C. Plant Material. The stems of Arrabidaea samydoides were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guac¸u´, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M.Y. in April 2000. A voucher specimen (Moraes 43) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. Dried and pulverized stems (0.837 kg) from A. samydoides were exhaustively extracted with ethanol at room temperature to give a crude extract (32.86 g). The resultant extract was diluted with MeOH-H2O (8:2) and then partitioned with hexane, CHCl3, and EtOAc to afford dried hexane (0.46 g), CHCl3 (2.50 g), EtOAc (4.77 g), stable emulsion (3.77 g), and hydroalcoholic (6.46 g) extracts. Compound 4 (3.03 g) was derived from the emulsion extract (3.77 g) and purified by successive crystallization using MeOH. The EtOAc extract was diluted in n-BuOH and partitioned with H2O. After the removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 3.40 and 0.37 g, respectively. The n-BuOH extract was further purified using Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting isocratically with MeOH, to afford 189 fractions. Fractions 160-167 (138.2 mg) yielded compound 1. Fractions 109-114 (186.7 mg) were combined, and further purification using a silica gel RP-18 column, eluted with gradient mixtures of H2O-MeOH (95:5 to 100), led to the isolation of 5 (14.8 mg) and 2 (21.0 mg). Fractions 115-122 (288.8 mg) were combined and subjected to silica gel RP-18 column chromatography using gradient mixtures of H2O-MeOH (95:5 to 100) to yield 6 (27.4 mg). Fractions 123-136 (294.0 mg) were combined and subjected to a silica gel RP-18 column eluted with gradient mixtures of H2O-MeOH (95:5 to 100) to afford 3 (25.3 mg). Determination of the Radical Scavenging Activity. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a stable radical in methanol (200 µmol, 2 mL). The reagent was added to a 1 mL aliquot of the compounds, previously dissolved in Table 4.

Each mixture was shaken and held for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin was used as a reference compound. DPPH solution (2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as a control. The evaluation of the reduced form of DPPH generated in situ was performed measuring the decrease in the current (I) on the electrochemical cell of the ElCD.15 The areas obtained in each chromatogram were normalized and compared with the one obtained for the blank. The radical scavenging activity of the samples was expressed in terms of IC50 (concentration in µmol required for a 50% decrease in current (I) by the reduced form of DPPH). Rutin was used as reference compound. Redox Potential. The determination of the optimal poten- tial (Eox) required to apply on each sample was obtained by means of a hydrodynamic voltammogram generated for each compound (Table 5). 2-(2′-O-trans-Caffeoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7- tetrahydroxyxanthone (1): orange powder (MeOH); [R]25D -185.46° (c 5.0, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 242 (4.48), 257 (4.46), 318 (4.35), 387 (sh) (4.10) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3) 235.5 (4.58), 265.5 (4.57), 355 (4.45), 408.5 (sh) (4.34) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3 + HCl) 233 (4.54), 265 (4.47), 337 (4.52), 406.5 (4.05) nm; (MeOH + KOH) 248 (4.62), 272 (4.49), 392 (4.65); (MeOH + NaOAc) 241 (4.54), 332 (4.32), 376 (4.28) nm; (MeOH + H3- BO3 + NaOAc) 261.5 (4.57), 357 (4.42); IR (KBr) νmax 3370, 1615, 1474, 1287, 1176, 1072, 813, 704 cm-1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR (CD3OD), see Tables 1 and 2; ESI-MS/MS, see Tables 3 and 4; HRESI-MS m/z 583.1008 [M - H]- (calcd for C28H23O14, 583.1088). 2-(2′-O-trans-Cinnamoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7- tetrahydroxyxanthone (2): yellow powder (MeOH); [R]25D -125.66° (c 2.65, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 243 (sh) (4.63), 258 (4.78), 315 (sh) (4.20), 364.5 (4.18) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3) 237 (4.66), 264 (4.81), 325.5 (4.23), 378.5 (4.34) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3 + HCl) 241 (4.64), 260 (4.76), 340 (sh) (4.27), 375 (sh) (4.20) nm; (MeOH + KOH) 240 (4.60), 273 (4.74), 340 (sh) (4.20), 391 (4.61) nm, (MeOH + NaOAc) 242 (4.70), 260 (4.72), 374 (4.38) nm; (MeOH + H3BO3 + NaOAc) 262 (4.85), 314 (4.31), 371 (4.36) nm; IR (KBr) νmax 3378, 2925, 1628, 1473, 1286, 1186, 1074, 827, 765 cm-1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR (CD3- OD), see Tables 1 and 2; ESI-MS/MS, see Tables 3 and 4; HRESI-MS m/z 551.1241 [M - H]- (calcd for C28H23O12, 551.1190). 2-(2′-O-trans-Coumaroyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7- tetrahydroxyxanthone (3): yellow powder (MeOH); [R]25D -189.0° (c 2.7, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 237.5 (4.41), 258.5 (4.43), 314.5 (4.42), 367 (4.02) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3) 235 (4.57), 268.5 (4.52), 321.5 (4.42), 416 (4.26) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3 + HCl) 232.5 (4.53), 265.5 (4.46), 322.5 (4.49), 405.5 (4.00) nm; (MeOH + KOH) 251 (4.45), 272 (sh) (4.31), 283 (4.38) nm; (MeOH + NaOAc) 236.5 (4.48), 260 (4.35), 315.5 (4.35), 374.5 (4.21) nm; (MeOH + H3BO3 + NaOAc) 230 (4.46), 262 (4.52), 317 (4.41), 373 (4.09) nm; IR (KBr) νmax 3390, 2924, 1614, 1473, 1286, 1168, 1000, 819 cm-1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR (CD3OD), see Tables 1 and 2; ESI-MS/MS, see Tables 3 and 4; HRESI- MS m/z 567.1183 [M - H]- (calcd for C28H24O13, 567.1139).

Additionally, 19 known compounds such as benzoic acids, chromenes, and flavonoids were isolated and identified. The antifungal activity of these compounds was evaluated by bioautographic TLC assay against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. Piperaceae species have been extensively investigated as a source of new natural products with potential anti- tumoral, antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal activi- ties.1-3 The phytochemical profile in Piper species is characterized by the production of typical classes of com- pounds such as amides, benzoic acids, and chromenes in addition to lignans, neolignans, and a few alkaloids.4-6 As part of our research aiming to uncover new antifungal compounds in Brazilian Piperaceae species, we have previ- ously reported the occurrence of pyrrolidine amides in P. hispidum7 and piperidine, isobutyl, and pyrrolidine amides in P. tuberculatum8 and P. arboreum.9 Additionally, anti- fungal prenylated hydroquinones and flavanones from leaves of P. crassinervium10 have been described as well. The search for new antifungal compounds will contribute to establish a model for further investments in this field in order to preserve, to study, and to exploit rationally the remaining flora of Sa˜o Paulo State. In the course of the Biota Program (http://www.biota.sp), a large number of Piper species collected in the state of Sa˜o Paulo had their extracts assayed by means of bioau- tography using Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig). Since the extracts of Piper crassinervium Kunth, P. aduncum L., P. hostman- nianum (Miquel) C. DC., and P. gaudichaudianum Kunth showed high growth inhibitory activity, they were subjected to dereplication procedures using chromatographic tech- niques associated with the bioautographic assay. Thus, the major aim of this paper is to describe the isolation and structural determination of the new antifungal compounds from Piperaceae species. Results and Discussion The MeOH extract from leaves of P. crassinervium yielded three prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acids [4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzo- ic acid (crassinervic acid, 1), 4-hydroxy-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′- oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (2), and 4-hydroxy- (3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-Z-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (3)], 3,4,5-trimethoxydihydrocinnamic acid12 (4), 1,4-dihydroxy- 2-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzene10 (5), and two flavanones [5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavanone13 (nar- ingenin 4′-methyl ether, 6) and 5,4′-dihydroxy-7-methoxy- flavanone14 (sakuranetin, 7)]. The CH2Cl2- and hexane-soluble parts of the MeOH extract of the leaves of P. aduncum yielded one new prenylated benzoic acid [methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3′-methyl- 1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate (aduncumene, 8)], four known chromenes [methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3′-methyl-2′-butenyl)- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (9), methyl 2,2-dimeth- yl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), methyl 8-hydroxy- 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (11), and 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid15,16 (12)], 4-methoxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), and two dihydrochalcones [2′,6′-dihydroxy-4′-meth- oxydihydrochalcone15 (14) and piperaduncine B17 (15)]. The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of P. hostmannianum yielded methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-ben- zopyran-6-carboxylate16 (10), three prenylated methyl hy- droxybenzoate derivatives [methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-butenyl)benzoate18,19 (16), methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-hydroxy-3′-butenyl)benzoate16 (17), and the new derivative methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate (hostmaniene, 18)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves and roots of P. gaudichaudianum yielded two chromenes [2-methyl- 2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2H-1- benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (gaudichaudianic acid, 20) and methyl 2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylate22 (21)], three prenylated benzoic acids [4-methoxy-3- (3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), 4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid23 (22), and methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)ben- zoate24 (methyl taboganate, 23)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). Compound 1 was isolated from the leaves of P. crassin- ervium as a white amorphous solid. Its molecular formula was established as C17H22O5 by analysis of its HREIMS spectrum (m/z 306.1459, calcd 306.1467). The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3380 cm-1), two carbonyl groups (1696, 1611 cm-1), and an aromatic ring (1489, 1421 cm-1).

Prod. 2004, 67, 1783-1788 10.1021/np030530j CCC: $27.50 © 2004 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 10/26/2004 for three aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.93 (d, J ) 8.9 Hz), 8.11 (dd, J ) 8.9 and 2.4 Hz), and 8.56 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz), indicative of a 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. Additional signals included three methyl singlets (δ 1.37, 1.50, 1.58), two doublets at δ 2.77 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz) and 2.64 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz), characteristic of an isolated R-carbonyl methylene group, and a triplet at δ 4.98 (1H, J ) 7.2 Hz), indicating the presence of a double bond in the side chain. The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) showed signals for 17 carbon atoms assigned as two carbonyl (δ 191.5, 170.6), six aromatic (δ 163.7, 137.3, 129.9, 122.1, 119.9, 118.8), two olefinic (δ 132.5, 122.9), three methyl (δ 25.6, 23.9, 17.5), one tertiary carbinolic (δ 82.3), and three aliphatic meth- ylenic carbons (δ 47.2, 39.3, 22.2). The assignments of the signals for aromatic carbons were based on comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data reported for known benzoic acids analogues.11 The connectivity between aromatic and aliphatic moieties was revealed by analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The correlations between signals at δ 8.56 (H-2)/2.77 (H-2′a)/2.64 (H-2′b) with 191.5 (C-1′) as well as between δ 8.56 (H-2)/8.11 (H-6) with 170.6 (CO2H) (Figure 1) indicated that compound 1 contains one carbonyl group at C-1′ and one carboxyl group attached to C-1. The double bond at the side chain was assigned on the basis of the observed cross-peaks between δ 4.98 (H-6′) and 25.6 (C-8′)/17.5 (C-9′) in the HMBC spectrum and between signals at δ 4.98 (H-6′), 2.03 (H-5′), 1.58 (H-8′), and 1.50 (H-9′) in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Thus, the hydroxyl group on a tertiary carbon atom was placed at C-3′ of the side chain, in agreement with the HMBC correlations observed between the hydrogen signals at δ 2.77 (H-2′a)/ 2.64 (H-2′b), 1.70 (H-4′), and 1.37 (H-10′) with the carbon signal at δ 82.3 (C-3′). Analysis of the DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMBC NMR spectra allowed full assignment for all hydrogen and carbon atoms, and thus, the structure of crassinervic acid (1) was elucidated as 4-hydroxy-3-(3′,7′- dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzoic acid. Compound 8 was isolated from the leaves of P. aduncum as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula C14H16O4 was determined by LRESIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 1700, 1610, and at 1445 cm-1, assignable to two carbonyl groups and aromatic double bonds, respectively. The structure of the prenylated benzoic acid derivative was recognized by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum, which showed signals at δ 8.18 (1H, d, J ) 1.9 Hz), 8.06 (1H, dd, J ) 8.5 and 1.9 Hz), and 6.93 (1H, d, J ) 8.5 Hz). This spectrum also showed a set of signals including two methyl groups at δ 1.96 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz)/2.20 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz) and a multiplet at 6.53 (1H), which are characteristics of an isoprene unit, and additionally, two methoxyl groups at δ 3.90 (3H, s) and 3.86 (3H, s). The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) exhibited, in the low-field region, one carbomethoxyl group at δ 166.6, six aromatic carbons at δ 161.2, 134.1, 132.0, 131.2, 122.9, 111.4, and two signals corresponding to the double-bond carbons at δ 125.1 (CH) and 156.7 (C). These two signals, associated with the carbonyl signal at δ 192.7, indicated an R,â-unsaturated carbonyl system.22,25,26 The high-field region exhibited signals assignable to two methyl groups at δ 28.3 and 21.6 and two methoxyl groups at δ 52.5 and 56.2. The assign- ment of all signals observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 8 was corroborated by HMQC and HMBC experiments (Figure 1). The HMBC spectrum showed the correlation of the signal at δ 192.2 (C-1′) with the hydrogens at δ 8.18 (H-6), 8.06 (H-4), and 6.53 (H-2′) and between δ 166.6 (C-6′) and 8.18 (H-6) and also with 3.86 (OCH3). Finally, the cross-peaks observed between δ 156.7 (C-3′) and 2.20 (H-4′) and 1.96 (H-5′) confirmed the structure of 8 as methyl 2-methoxyl-5-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate, named aduncumene. Compound 18 was obtained from the leaves of P. host- mannianum, as a white amorphous powder. Its LRESIMS data associated with 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) and elemental analysis indicated a molecular formula of C13H18O5. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3463 cm-1), an aromatic ring (1613, 1440 cm-1), and a carbonyl group (1715 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals assignable to three coupled aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.76 (d, J ) 9.0 Hz), 7.72 (dd, J ) 9.0 and 2.0 Hz), and 7.77 (d, J ) 2.0 Hz), characteristic of the 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. In addition, this spectrum displayed three singlets at δ 1.27 (3H), 1.30 (3H), and 3.80 (3H) assigned, respectively, to two methyl groups attached to an oxygen-bearing carbon and to one methoxyl group. The presence of an oxymethine hydrogen at δ 3.77 (dd, J ) 6.0 and 4.5 Hz), associated with the signals at δ 3.02 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 4.5 Hz) and 2.73 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 6.0 Hz), suggested a hydroxylated isoprene side chain at C-3 of the benzoic acid nucleus. The HMBC spectrum of 18 (Figure 1) showed correlation between the signals at δ 31.1 (C-1′) and 7.77 (H-2), between δ 69.2 (C-2′) and 1.27 (H-4′)/1.30 (H-5′)/3.02 (H-1′a)/2.73 1784 Journal of Natural Products, 2004, Vol. 67, No. 11 Lago et al. (H-1′b), between δ 25.0 (C-4′) and 1.30 (H-5′), and between δ 22.0 (C-5′) and 3.77 (H-2′)/1.27 (H-4′), confirming the positioning of the vicinal hydroxyl groups at C-2′ and C-3′. The methoxyl group was determined as a methyl ester, considering that a cross-peak between the signals at δ 166.9 (C-6′) and 3.80 (OCH3) was observed in the HMBC spectrum. Therefore, the structure of 18 was determined as methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate, named hostmaniane. Compound 20 was isolated from the leaves of P. gaud- ichaudianum as an amorphous solid. The molecular for- mula C22H28O3 was deduced by LREIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3500, 1681, and 1601 cm-1 assignable to a hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic ring, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at δ 5.58 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and 6.38 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and four singlets at δ 1.41 (3H, s), 1.67 (3H, s), 1.56 (3H, s), and 1.73 (6H, s), which were associated with the chromene/isoprene moi- eties.15,27 Two low-field doublets at δ 7.59 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz) and 7.75 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz), assignable to the meta aromatic hydrogens, indicated a 3,4,5-trisubstituted benzoic acid derivative, which was corroborated by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. A carboxyl group, with a signal at δ 172.1, was placed between the two aromatic hydrogens (C-6). The chromene moiety was confirmed by the presence of signals at δ 79.9, 129.5, and 121.9 assignable to the carbons C-2, C-3, and C-4, respectively.27 The DEPT 135° spectrum confirmed these previous assignments and showed the presence of three methylenes at δ 41.9 (C-1′), 22.7 (C-2′), and 28.2 (C-1′′), which were associated with the respective protons at δ 1.78 (H-1′), 2.25 (H-2′), and 3.28 (H-1′′) by means of the HMQC spectrum. The linkage positions of the two isoprene side chains to the chromene/aromatic ring were determined by an HMBC experiment (Figure 1), in which correlations between the signals at δ 128.9 (C-8) and 5.28 (H-2′′), between δ 131.8 (C-7) and 3.28 (H-1′′), between δ 41.9 (C-1′) and 1.41 (H-9), and between δ 123.9 (C-3′) and 1.78 (H-1′) were observed. Thus, the complete assign- ments of NMR data of 20 were made by analysis of HMQC and HMBC data and by comparison with those obtained for similar compounds isolated from P. lhotzkyanum and P. aduncum.11,28 Therefore, the structure of 20 was deter- mined as 2-methyl-2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl- 2′′-butenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid, named gaud- ichaudianic acid. The optical rotation, [R]25D +21 (c 0.1, CHCl3), was similar to that observed for sargatriol,29 but this compound has two additional chiral carbons (C5′ and C6′) in its side chain and is not appropriate for a direct comparison. Nevertheless, the CD curve obtained for 20 was fully opposite to that described for sargatriol including the positive Cotton effect at 260-280 nm (styrene chro- mophore). Thus, despite the differences in the substitution pattern in the aromatic ring for 20, the S configuration at C-2 was suggested. The antifungal activities of compounds 1-23 isolated from these four Piper species were evaluated against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum7 (Table 1). The fungitoxic potential for the compounds 5, 6, 7, 17, 19, and 21 has been previously reported.10,22,26,27 As can be seen, the chromene 9, crassinervic acid (1), and hostmaniane (18) showed high potential as antifungal compounds and should be further evaluated against other fungi. Several com- pounds, 2, 3, 5, 7, 16, and 19, showed potency (1.0 µg) similar to that of the control. In the prenylated benzoic acid series (1-3) the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the side chain, as in the case of 1, doubled the activity, while the changes in the double-bond configuration (2 and 3) did not cause significant improvement. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeter (Na filter, λ ) 588 nm) and CD spectrum in CHCl3 with a JASCO ORD/UV-6 spectropolarimeter. IR spectra were measured in KBr pellets on a Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrometer model 1750. UV spectra were recorded on a HP 8452 A spectropho- tometer using MeOH as solvent. LREIMS and HREIMS spectra were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/5988 A and a VG Autospec spectrometer, respectively, while LRESIMS spectra were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 500/300 and 125/75 MHz, respectively, on Bruker DRX-500 and Bruker DPX-300 spectrometers. CDCl3 (Aldrich) was used as solvent and TMS as internal standard. Chemical shifts were reported in δ units (ppm) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. Elemental analyses were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer elemental analyzer model 2400 CHN. Silica gel (Merck, 230-400 mesh) and Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma) were used for column chromatographic separa- tions, while silica gel 60 PF254 (Merck) was used for analytical Figure 1.

The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays, C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491, have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. For the antifungal assay 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 100.0 µg of crude extracts or semipurified fractions were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates, developed with hex- ane-EtOAc (7:3), and dried for complete removal of solvents. For the pure compound 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 50.0, 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 µg were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. cladosporioides or C. sphaerospermum in glucose and salt solution and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C, following the previously reported procedure.10,30,31 Fungal growth inhibition appeared as clear zones against a dark background, indicating the minimum amount of compounds 1-25 required for it (Table 1). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls, whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls. Acknowledgment.

The structures of the new alkaloids were established on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis, mainly 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as high-resolution HRESIMS. Alkaloid 3 showed strong free- radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as well as pronounced anti- oxidant activity evidenced by redox properties measured by ElCD-HPLC. Additionally, alkaloids 1-9 were submitted to TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Both 7 and 8 were shown to be moderate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors at a concentration of 0.1 and 1.0 µM, respectively. In an in vitro rat brain assay, 7 showed moderate activity (IC50 1.86 µM), compared to the standard compound, galanthamine (IC50 0.92 µM). Species of the Rubiaceae have been used for various medicinal purposes throughout the world,1 and our sys- tematic studies on Brazilian plants of this family have revealed marked diversity of the secondary metabolites present and their biological activities.2 In a previous contribution, we reported the isolation, structure elucida- tion, and cytotoxic activity of turbinatine (7), an indole alkaloid isolated from leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata DC. (Rubiaceae).3 As part of our search for bioactive substances from endemic species of the Amazon, C. turbinata was studied further after detection of antioxidant activity in its aqueous and ethanol extracts, indicated by strong free- radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl- hydrazyl (DPPH), as well as significant antioxidant activity determined by redox properties measured by electrochemi- cal detector coupled to an HPLC (ElCD-HPLC). Addition- ally, a TLC screening procedure for acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors was used as a preliminary test to detect potential bioactive compounds to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD).4 The great interest in the search for potential natural AchE inhibitors is due to the recent discovery of galan- thamine, an alkaloid, with long-acting, selective, reversible, and competitive activity as an AchE inhibitor, used as a drug for the treatment of AD. In this paper the details of the isolation and structure elucidation of two new ana- logues of strictosidine (1 and 2), as well as the isolation of six known indole glucoalkaloids (3-8), and the â-carboline alkaloid 9, together with their antioxidant and acetylcho- linesterase inhibitory activity data, are presented. Anti- oxidant indole glucoalkaloids as acetylcholinesterase in- hibitors are being reported for the first time. Air-dried bark and leaves from C. turbinata were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. Both ethanolic extracts were dis- solved in MeOH-H2O 80% and partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. The aqueous phase from the bark extract and the n-BuOH phase from the leaf extract were purified using preparative HPLC, affording alkaloids 1-9. Compound 1 was isolated as a yellowish amorphous solid with strong fluorescence detected at 357 nm, which is compatible with an aromatic 5,6-dihydro-â-carboline chro- mophore, as corroborated by an indole N-H IR band (3370 cm-1). The molecular formula of this alkaloid was deter- mined as C27H32N2O9 (13 degrees of unsaturation) by HRESIMS ([M + H]+ m/z 529.2166). Interpretation of the ion peak at m/z 367.1596 [M - Glc + H]+ suggested the presence of a glucose moiety in 1 and indicated a similarity with the strictosidine pattern of fragmentation.5 A detailed understanding of the molecular structure of this alkaloid was obtained from NMR spectral analysis (Tables 1 and 2). The unsubstituted indole moiety was deduced from the presence of four aromatic hydrogens at δ 7.38 (d, J ) 7.5 Hz), 6.90 (dd, J ) 7.5; J ) 7.5 Hz), 7.02 (dd, J ) 7.5; J ) 7.5 Hz), and 7.20 (d, J ) 7.5 Hz). A singlet at δ 7.72 corresponding to an enolic hydrogen (H-17) and a doublet at δ 5.81 (J ) 9.0 Hz) attributed to a hemiacetalic hydrogen (H-21), in addition to signals for the methylene and methine hydrogens, H-14 and H-15, respectively, and signals for olefin hydrogens, H-18 and H-19, suggested the presence of a seco-iridoid moiety, as in strictosidine-type alkaloids. The 13C NMR data (Table 2) confirmed this assumption. Comparison of the NMR data of 1 with those reported for strictosidine (5)6 indicated in this alkaloid the absence of the signal corresponding to C-3 (δH ) 4.42, δC ) 51.2), compatible with the structure, 3,4-dehydro-stric- tosidine. An additional resonance at δ 138.5 in the 13C NMR spectrum was assigned to C-3 and gave additional support to the proposed structure of 1, which was cor- roborated by COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and NOE experiments * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

COSY and NOESY experiments were funda- mental to assign the relative configuration of C-15, C-20, and C-21 of this alkaloid, which was inferred to have the same stereochemistry as strictosidine. The structure of 1 was thus defined as 3,4-dehydro-strictosidine. Compound 2 was obtained as a pale yellow amorphous powder. HRESIMS analysis gave a protonated molecular ion [M + H]+ peak at m/z 515.2056, corresponding to the molecular formula C26H30N2O9. The IR spectrum showed absorptions at νmax 3440 and 3368 cm-1, indicating the presence of -OH and -NH functions, respectively. Inspec- tion of the NMR data (1H, 13C, DEPT, and 2D experiments) showed a structure similar to 1, including also a glucose moiety, confirmed by the ESIMS fragment ion at m/z 353.1596 [M - Glc + H]+ and NMR data. The only difference in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) of alkaloid 2 was the absence of signals corresponding to a methoxyl group (δH ) 3.69, δC ) 53.0), which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid function, corroborated by the signal at δ 175.0 (CdO) and the IR absorption at 3440 cm-1 assigned to the carboxylic hydroxy group. HMBC cross-peaks (Figure 1) confirmed the 1H and 13C NMR assignments, and the proposed structure for compound 2 as the new 3,4-dehydro-strictosidinic acid. Compounds 3-6 were identified as cordifoline,7 stricto- sidinic acid,8 strictosidine,8 and 5R-carboxystrictosidine,8 respectively, after comparison of their NMR spectral data with reported values. Compound 7 was previously isolated from this plant.3 The â-carboline alkaloids 8 and 9 were identified as desoxycordifoline7 and harman-3-carboxylic acid,9 respectively. After careful analysis of the literature, 13C NMR data for compounds 3 and 9 were found to be unpublished and thus these data are included in Table 2. Compounds 1-9 were tested toward the DPPH radical (Table 3).10 Alkaloid 3 showed strong scavenging activity against the DPPH radical (IC50 18.3 µg/mL) using the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 12.3 µg/mL) as reference, Chart 1 Table 1. 1H NMR Spectral Data for Compounds 1 and 2 in CD3ODa (500 MHz) position 1 2 2 3 5 3.20 m 3.20 m 3.68 m 6 3.40 m 3.45 m 7 8 9 7.38 d (7.5) 7.48 d (8.0) 10 6.90 dd (7.5; 7.5) 7.06 dd (8.0, 8.0) 11 7.02 dd (7.5; 7.5) 7.15 dd (8.0, 8.0) 12 7.20 d (7.5) 7.34 d (8.0) 13 14 2.20 m 2.40 m 15 2.98 m 2.92 m 16 17 7.72 s 7.59 s 18 cis 5.16 d (10.5) 5.25 d (11.0) 18 trans 5.28 d (17.5) 5.35 d (17.5) 19 5.75 ddd (8.0; 10.5; 17.5) 5.92 ddd (8.0, 10.5, 17.5) 20 2.38 m 2.35 m 21 5.81 d (9.0) 5.89 br s 22 OCH3 3.69 s 1′ 4.77 d (8.0) 4.80 d (7.0) 2′ 3.14 m 3.43 m 3′ 3.30 m 3.42 m 4′ 3.16 m 3.28 m 5′ 3.32 br dd (5.7; 6.3) 3.26 m 6′ 3.91 br dd (5.7; 11.0) 4.00 br dd (5.5; 12.0) 3.57 dd (6.3; 11.0) 3.68 dd (6.5; 12.0) a Chemical shifts (δ) downfield from TMS, J couplings (in parentheses) in Hz.

This result indicates that the free-radical scavenging activity of this indole alkaloid is due to its higher hydrogen-donating ability (to DPPH), provided by the hydroxy group at C-10, which results in a more efficient radical-scavenging effect.11 The electrochemi- cal behavior displayed by these alkaloids showed a good correlation with the radical-scavenging effect measured in the DPPH assay, which clearly indicates that substances with oxidative peaks above +1.2V (Table 3) and a small oxidative capacity have weaker radical-scavenging proper- ties than those that are oxidized at lower potentials.12 Compounds 1-9 were submitted to preliminary TLC screening for selecting potential AchE inhibitors,13 in which only compounds 7 and 8 inhibited the enzyme at 0.1 and 1.0 µM concentrations. Due to the limited amount of alkaloid 8, only compound 7 was submitted to further evaluation in an in vitro rat brain assay, to measure its AchE inhibitory potential, and showed a moderate activity (IC50 1.86 µM) when compared with the standard galan- thamine (IC50 0.92 µM). Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter in MeOH at 25 °C, using a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectro- photometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as internal standard. ESIMS were obtained on a VG Platform Fisons instrument, and HRTOF-ESIMS-MS was performed using a Q-TOF (Micromass) (40 eV) instrument. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-4 (Sigma-Aldrich), and Sephadex LH-20 (Phar- macia). TLC was performed using silica gel 60 (Merck, µ ) 230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 °C and/or Dragendorff reagent. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C18 (250 mm × 21,20 mm, Luna-Phenomenex) columns. Plant Material. Authenticated Chimarrhis turbinata DC. was collected in Reserva do Viro, Bele´m, PA, Brazil, in February 2000 and identified by Dr. Marina Thereza V. do A. Campos. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sa˜o Paulo (Voucher No. Lopes-51). Extraction and Isolation. Air-dried bark and leaves from C. turbinata were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. Both ethanolic extracts were dissolved in MeOH-H2O 80% and partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. The n-BuOH fraction (12.3 g) after solvent evaporation was dissolved into H2O (5 mL) and submitted to filtration over XAD-4 eluted with H2O, MeOH-H2O (20-100% gradient), acetone, MeOH-CH2- Cl2 (1:1), CH2Cl2, and Et2O. The subfractions obtained (A-K) were compared by TLC and revealed with specific reagents to alkaloids (Dragendorff). Fractions A (5.0 g), B (700.0 mg), and C (253.0 mg) were purified. Fraction A was submitted to VLC (vacuum-liquid chromatography) using octadecylsilane silica and gradient elution of decreasing polarity with H2O, MeOH, acetone, and CH2Cl2 to give seven fractions. Fraction A4 (660.0 mg) was purified by HPLC using MeCN-H2O-AcOH Table 2. 13C NMR Data for Compounds 1-3 and 9 in CD3OD Solutionsa carbon 1 2 3 9 1 136.1 s 2 135.2 s 136.2 s 137.2 s 3 138.5 s 148.0 s 141.9 s 141.7 s 4 115.4 d 4a 127.0 s 4b 121.3 s 5 48.2 t 48.0 t 136.8 s 122.1 d 6 28.0 t 16.9 t 116.3 d 120.1 d 7 107.9 s 105.8 s 138.9 s 128.3 d 8 127.5 s 127.3 s 123.0 s 112.1 d 8a 140.8 s 9 119.1 d 119.1 d 122.5 d 9a 136.4 s 10 120.5 d 120.6 d 114.3 d 11 123.7d 123.4 s 153.8 s 12 112.2 d 112.3 d 106.6 d 13 138.2 s 138.2 s 132.2 s 14 35.0 t 35.2 t 33.5 t 15 32.6 t 35.0 t 35.3 t 16 108.2 s 112.3 s 109.6 s 17 157.1 d 153.6 d 155.0 d 18 119.7 t 119.1 t 120.0 t 19 135.2 d 136.3 d 135.0 d 20 45.3 d 45.6 d 45.5 d 21 97.3 d 96.8 d 97.2 d 22 172.0 s 175.0 s 169.1 s CH3 20.2 q COOH 167.0 s 166.7 s OCH3 53.0 q 51.8 q 1′ 100.4 d 100.3 d 100.3 d 2′ 74.6 d 78.6 d 78.6 d 3′ 77.9 d 77.9 d 77.9 d 4′ 71.7 d 71.7 d 71.6 d 5′ 78.8 d 74.7 d 74.6 d 6′ 63.0 t 63.0 t 62.9 t a Chemical shifts (d) downfield from TMS, 125.77 MHz.

Determination of the Radical-Scavenging Activity. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a stable radical in methanol (200 µmol, 2 mL). The reagent was added to 1 mL aliquots of compounds 1-9, previously dissolved in methanol, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 µM. Each mixture was shaken and held for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin was used as a standard compound. DPPH solution (2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as control. The evaluation of the reduced form of DPPH generated in situ was performed measuring the decrease in the current (I) on the electrochemical cell of the ElCD.10 The areas obtained in each chromatogram were normalized and compared with the one obtained for the blank. The radical- scavenging activity of the samples was expressed in terms of IC50 (concentration in µM required for a 50% decrease in current (I) by the reduced form of DPPH). Redox Potential. The determination of the optimal poten- tial (Eox) required to apply on each compound was obtained by means of hydrodynamic voltammograms generated for each compound10 (Table 3). TLC Screening Assay for Acetylcholinesterase Inhibi- tors. Samples were dissolved in MeOH or in MeOH-CH2Cl2 mixtures to 0.1 and 1.0 mM concentrations. Physostigmine and galathamine were used as reference compounds in two con- centrations (0.1 and 0.01 µM). After application of 2 µL of each sample on a silica gel plate, it was sprayed with DTNB/ATCI reagent (1:1 solution of 1 mM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 1 µM acetylthiocholine iodide in buffer) until saturation of the silica. The plate was allowed to dry for 5 min, and then 3 U/mL of enzyme solution was sprayed. After a while, a yellow background appeared, with white spots showing the inhibitory compounds.4 Evaluation in a Rat Brain Assay.

Their structures were determined by spectroscopic/spectrometric data interpretation of 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR and MS experiments. The relative configuration was established by NOESY analysis, while the conformation adopted by these molecules was evaluated through molecular modeling studies and coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. Furthermore, the anxiolytic effects of the E. mulungu aqueous alcoholic crude extract and of the purified alkaloids were evaluated using the elevated T-maze test. There are about 115 known species of Erythrina Mart. (Legu- minoseae, Papilionaceae) in the tropics and subtropics, as well as in some temperate regions of the world,1 and approximately half of them have been studied.2 Phytochemical analyses have demon- strated that these plants accumulate erythrinian alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenes.3-5 Erythrina plant species are widely used in folk medicine to treat different health problems such as agitation, insomnia, and inflammatory processes.2 Previous studies have demonstrated the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the crude extracts of E. senegalensis,6 E. Velutina, and E. mulungu.7 It has been demonstrated that alkaloids isolated from E. americana have anticonvulsant, hypotensive, hypnotic, and analgesic effects.8 The tranquilizer effects of crude alkaloid fractions from E. americana were investigated in a model that provokes aggressive- ness in rats by visual isolation.9 It was observed that crude alkaloids diminished the aggressive behavior, and their effects were similar to the benzodiazepine compound diazepam.9 E. mulungu, popularly known as mulungu, is a medium well- branched tree native to Southern Brazil, where it is appreciated for its beautiful reddish flowers. Since its flowers have the same color of corals, sometimes this species is also called coral tree.10 In popular medicine, a tincture prepared from the leaf or bark decoction from E. mulungu is used to calm agitation and other disorders of the nervous system, i.e., insomnia and depression.11 It has been demonstrated that acute and chronic treatments with aqueous alcoholic extracts from E. mulungu produce anxiolytic-like effects on a specific subset of defensive behavior in rats exposed in the elevated T-maze (ETM) and in the light-dark transition model (LDTM).12,13 These antianxiety effects were similar to that provoked by the well-known anxiolytic compound diazepam.12,13 As part of our research project focusing on phytochemical investigation of medicinal plants with central nervous system activity, we now report the isolation of a new (1) as well as two known (2, 3) erythrinian alkaloids and their anxiolytic properties. Results and Discussion (+)-11R-Hydroxyerythravine (1) was obtained as an amorphous powder and showed a molecular ion [M + H]+ at m/z 316.3681 in its HRESIMS-MS, consistent with the molecular formula C18H21- NO4. The UV spectrum of 1 suggested that it contained a typical aromatic chromophore with maximum absorption at 283.6, 234.7, and 204.7 nm. IR absorption bands at 1615 and 3260 cm-1 indicated the presence of a conjugated system and a hydroxyl group, respectively. The aromatic part of the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited two singlets at δ 6.91 and 6.77, which in conjuction with two O-methyl groups at δ 3.90 and 3.71 indicated similarity to that of (+)-11â-hydroxyerysotrine,3,14 except for the exchange of an O-methyl for a hydroxyl group in 1. Additionally, the spectrum of 1 showed signals for one trisubstituted double bond at δ 5.66 br s and for one disubstituted double bond at δ 6.96 dd and 5.96 dd, evidencing the erythrinian skeleton for 1 (Table 1). Two oxymethine protons, H-3 at δ 4.37 (m) and H-11 at δ 4.74 (dd; J ) 3.60, 4.64 Hz), were identified by HMQC spectrum, and using these protons as a starting point, the COSY spectrum permitted the assignment of the H-4 and H-10 methylenes, respectively. The relative configuration of C-11 was determined by the coupling constant of H-11 (δ 4.74 dd; 3.60, 4.64), which is in good agreement with an R-oriented 11-OH, as was also observed for compound 3. Taking into account that most 1H NMR data published for several 11-hydroxyerythrinian derivatives were recorded at 360 MHz, 100 MHz, or under, the relative configuration of the stereogenic center at C-11 was analyzed by NMR experiments and also by molecular modeling studies. The 1H NMR data recorded in pyridine-d6 clearly * Corresponding authors. Phone: 55 16 3301-6983. Fax: 55 16 3301- 6980.

The 13C NMR (Table 1) data also were comparable with those of the alkaloid 3, which possesses C-11 with the same configuration. When we analyzed the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 3, the signal due to C-11 in both was observed at higher fields, ∆δ ≈10 ppm, when comparable to the same carbon of (+)-11â-hydroxyerysotrine (also named (+)-erythrartine), which is a C-11 epimer.3,14 The total assignment of 1 was done by examination of the COSY, HMQC, NOESY, and HMBC (Figure 1) data of this compound. To confirm the relative configuration of C-3 and C-11 and to establish the conformation of 1, the structure of (+)-R-hydroxyerysotrine (3) was used as a model for a conformational analyses approach with the introduction of dihedral angle constraints obtained from the coupling constants between H11-H10 and H3-H4. On the basis of 1H NMR data, the structure of compound 3 was build with an R-OH at C-11 (similar to compound 1) and submitted to confor- mational analysis using the semiempirical methods AM1 and PM5 in the gas phase, with CHCl3 and pyridine solvents, as previously described.15,16 The semiempirical methods were applied to com- pound 3 since it was previously identified as the 11R-epimer,14 and our studies demonstrated that 3 has an 11R-hydroxyl, similar to that of the new derivative 1. Four conformers were evaluated for this compound, obtained through inversion of ring B (two half- chairs) and of ring C (two envelopes). One of the half-chairs of ring B was not stable and changed to a twist-boat-like conformation (Figure 2C). This twist-boat, together with the conformational restraining induced by ring D, avoided the inversion of the envelope in ring C, allowing us to obtain only three minimum energy conformations for compound 3, named 3a, 3b, and 3c (Figure 2). The Haasnot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation18 estimates the 3JH,H coupling constants from the electronegativity of the substituents and from the H-C-C-H dihedral angle geometry. The obtained theoretical coupling constants for confor- mations 3a, 3b, and 3c are presented in Table 1, and their energies are shown in Table 2. The comparison between theoretical and experimental coupling constants allowed characterization of the conformation of the erythrinian alkaloids as represented by conformation 3c in Table 1 and Figure 2. As already described by us,16 this Hamiltonian presents better agreement with experimental data when compared to AM1. Compound 3 was reported as the 11R-epimer in E. lysistemon.14 However, the authors presented for epimeric compounds the same coupling constants, for the 11R- and 11â-epimers. In the previous and related studies, we did not find detailed 1H NMR information that could confirm the relative configuration of each epimer, and thus an intensive 1H NMR and molecular modeling analyses were performed in this paper. Alkaloid 2 was identified as (+)-erythravine (2).17 To investigate the anxiolytic effects of the alkaloids, behavioral tests were conducted using the ETM. As shown in Figure 3 at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg crude extract (CE) impaired inhibitory avoidance acquisition was observed, similar to that observed with diazepam (DZP, 2 mg/kg; ip), a classical anxiolytic drug. Two- way ANOVA showed a significant effect of treatment (F(5,49) ) 5.4; P < 0.0001) and trials (F(4,196) ) 27.37; P < 0.0001), but not of treatment versus trial interaction (F(20,196) ) 0.87, P ) 0.626). Post hoc comparisons revealed that both CE (100-400 mg/ kg) and DZP reduced significantly the latency to leave the enclosed arm when compared with the control group (P < 0.05, Duncan’s test). Additionally, one-way ANOVA (followed by Duncan’s test) revealed that the latency to leave the open arm was significantly lower for CE (400 mg/kg) treated animals when compared with the control group (F(5,49) ) 3.47, P ) 0.009). Figure 3B illustrates the effects of compound 1 on inhibitory avoidance and escape latencies. Two-way ANOVA showed sig- nificant effect of treatment (F(3,33) ) 8.30; P < 0.001), trials (F(4,- 132 ) 14.75; P < 0.0001), and treatment versus trials interaction Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Data for Alkaloids 1 in Pyridine-d5 and 3 in CD3Cl 1 3 theoretical JHH (Hz)a position δC δH (mult.)

Individual comparisons revealed that latencies to leave the enclosed arm were decreased with both 1 (10 mg/kg) and DZP treatments. Different from CE, one-way ANOVA did not reveal any effect of 1 or DZP on the latency to leave the open arms (F(3,33) ) 0.71; P ) 0.54). The effects of 2 in the ETM measurements are shown in Figure 3 C. Two-way ANOVA showed significant effect of treatment (F(3,55) ) 13.40, P < 0.0001), trials (F(4,220) ) 44.23; P < 0.0001), and treatment versus trials interaction (F(12,220) ) 6.33; P < 0.0001) in the inhibitory avoidance measurements. Duncan’s post hoc test revealed that animals treated with 2 (3 and 10 mg/kg) or DZP exhibited lower latencies to leave the enclosed arm of the ETM when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Neither 2 nor DZP significantly changed escape latencies (one-way ANOVA: F(3,55) ) 0.61, P < 0.60). Figure 3D shows the effects of 3 on the inhibitory avoidance and escape latencies in the ETM test. Two-way ANOVA showed effects of treatment (F(3,31) ) 7.65; P < 0.0001), trials (F(4,124) ) 18.38; P < 0.0001), and treatment versus trials interaction (F(12,- 124) ) 2.14; P < 0.001) on inhibitory avoidance acquisition. Duncan’s post hoc test revealed that the doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg of 3 significantly impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, an effect also shown with DZP (P < 0.05). One-way ANOVA showed that neither 3 nor DZP produced significant effects on latency to leave the open arm (F(3,31) ) 0.24; P ) 0.86). Additionally, one-way ANOVA revealed no treatment effects of CE, 1, 2, 3, or DZP on the number of rearing and crossings (locomotor activity) in the arena test (see Table 3). The present study demonstrated that acute po treatment with CE attenuated anxiety-related responses in mice submitted to an animal model of anxiety, i.e., the ETM. These results corroborate a previous study,12 in which the aqueous alcoholic extract of E. mulungu, at a dose of 200 mg/kg, produced anxiolytic-like effects in the inhibitory avoidance in the ETM in rats. These authors also reported an antianxiety effect with a lower dose of CE (100 mg/kg) in the light-dark transition model. In that study CE increased both the number of transitions between light and dark compartments and the time spent in the illuminated area, measures considered as anxiety indices.12 Similar effects have been reported with chronic treatment with an equivalent range of doses (50-200 mg/kg) of CE on inhibitory avoidance in the ETM as well as on the number of transitions between compartments, and in the time spent in the illuminated compartment in the light-dark transition model.13 This study demonstrated that the erythrinian alkaloids isolated from E. mulungu provoked anxiolytic-like effects in the ETM. The new erythrinian alkaloid 1 and the two known alkaloids 2 and 3 impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, and these effects were similar to that produced by DZP, a classical anxiolytic drug. The underlying mechanisms involved in the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids were not in the scope of the present study and remain to be determined. However, it has been demonstrated that the dihydro-â-erythroidine, an erythrinian alka- loid, antagonizes the excitatory effects of serotonin (5-HT) at the 5-HT3 receptor.24 Thus, it is likely that the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids from E. mulungu involve antagonism at 5-HT3 receptors, as shown for dihydro-â-erythroidine.24 Although attrac- tive, this hypothesis remains to be empirically tested. It was demonstrated that the crude extract of E. Vespertilio inhibited platelet 5-HT release.23 Platelets have been used as a useful model for studying Ca2+-dependent 5-HT release,23 the main action of serotonin at 5-HT3 receptors. It is interesting to note that the highest dose (400 mg/kg) of the crude extract decreased escape latency (i.e., the latency to leave the open arm) in the ETM. Similar effects obtained with other classes of drugs have been previously interpreted as anxiolytic, instead of anxiogenic.19 It has been suggested that drugs that diminish risk-assessment behavior, such as buspirone and the serotonin releaser fenfluramine, also decrease escape latencies in the ETM.19 Curiously, the pure alkaloids did not alter escape latencies. It is likely that synergistic interactions with other compounds of the crude extract are important to provoke the anxiolytic effects observed in the escape task. Taken together, these results suggests that the new erythrinian alkaloid (+)-11R-hydroxy-erythravine (1) and the known (+)- erythravine (2) and (+)-R-hydroxyerysotrine (3) are, in part, responsible for the anxiolytic effects observed with the crude extract of E. mulungu. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were mea- sured on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz curvette (length 1 cm). UV spectra were recorded on a HPLC system Varian PRO STAR 240, UV-diodo-array 330 detector. The IR spectrum was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 or Nicolet EMACT-40 FTIR spectrophotometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and 125 for 13C nuclei, respectively. Solvent peaks were used as a reference standard. For chromatographic procedures, silica gel PF 254 and silica gel (230- Figure 2.

With the exception of hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms C-3, C-4, C10, and C-11 the nonpolar hydrogen atoms were omitted in order to clarify the image. This computer-generated 3D interpretation also can be applied to compound 1, since the difference between these structures does not change significantly the values calculated for energy minimization.

Molecular modeling calculations were performed using the BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2 (BioMedCAChe, 2001). Plant Material. Influorescences of E. mulungu were collected in September 2002, at Rifania, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen is deposited in the herbarium of the Departament of Vegetal Biotechnol- ogy, at the University of Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil, under the reference number HPM-0032. Extraction and Isolation. Fresh influorescences (3 kg) were macerated with EtOH/H2O (70:30) at 30-50 °C over a period of 10 days. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a humid crude extract (CE) (120 g) that was acidified with a 10% HOAc solution. This solution was extracted with CHCl3 and was then made alkaline (pH 9-10) with NH4OH and re-extracted with CHCl3 to afford a mixture of crude alkaloids (670 mg). The alkaloidal fraction was separated by flash chromatography on Si gel, eluting with CHCl3/CH3OH (100:0 f 70:30), to yield 60 fractions of 20 mL each, grouped into five (1-2 ) A; 3-5 ) B; 6-20 ) C; 21-30 ) D; 31-60 ) E). Additional preparative TLC on Si gel of the fractions B, D, and E using Et2O/acetone/EtOH/NH4OH (50: 43:4:3) afforded (+)-11-R-hydroxyerythravine (1) (48 mg), (+)- erythravine (2) (95 mg), and (+)-11-R-hydroxyerysotrine (3) (36 mg).

The system composed by rings A-D was constructed and submitted to conformational analysis. Each of the obtained conformations was further submitted to full geometry opti- mization using AM1 and PM5 semiempirical methods in both gas and solvent phases. For representation of CDCl3 and pyridine solvents the COSMO solvation model was used. The relative permittivity value for CDCl3 was adjusted to ϵ ) 4.9 and for pyridine to ϵ ) 12.5, while the effective VDW radius of the solvent molecules was adjusted to 2.81 Å for CDCl3 and to 2.9 Å for pyridine. Hessian matrix analyses were employed to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. All calculations were performed using BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2.25 In order to obtain theoretical 3JH,H coupling constants for the minimum energy conforma- tions produced in conformational analysis, we applied the Haasnot- Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation18 to the endocyclic angle geometries.

Male Swiss mice (Sa˜o Paulo State University/UNESP, SP, Brazil), weighing 25-35 g, were housed in groups of 10 per cage (41 cm × 34 cm × 16 cm) and maintained under a normal 12 h light cycle (lights on 07:00 h) in a temperature/ humidity controlled environment (23 ( 1 °C/55 ( 5%). Food and water were freely available. All mice were experimentally naive. Experimental procedures were in compliance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Local Ethical Committee (no. 35/2004). Compound Administration. CE and alkaloids were suspended in saline (NaCl 0.9%) and diazepam (DZP) in saline + 2% Tween 80. Animals were orally treated with CE (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) and with a range of doses (3-10 mg/kg) of each isolated alkaloid, or vehicle (saline), and intraperitoneally with DZP (2 mg/kg). All compounds were administered 30 min before the experimental session. Apparatus. Elevated T-Maze (ETM). The ETM was positioned 38.5 cm above the floor with three arms of equal dimensions (30 cm × 5 cm). One arm was enclosed by transparent glass walls (15 cm) and stood perpendicular to two open arms. To avoid falls, the open arms were surrounded by a Plexiglas rim 0.25 cm high. Locomotor Activity Test (LAT). To assess locomotor activity, animals were exposed to a plastic rectangular box (40 cm × 48 cm × 30 cm) with its floor divided into 30 squares (8 cm2). A standard procedure was used for both tests.19 Statistics. All results were initially submitted to Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance. Where this test yielded significance, results were log transformed and again submitted to Levene’s test, before being submitted to ANOVA. The inhibitory avoidance measures obtained in the ETM were submitted to two-way ANOVA with treatment as the independent factor and trial as the dependent factor. Where significant main effects or interactions were obtained, data were further analyzed by Duncan’s post hoc test. The escape latency in the ETM and LAT results were submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed by Duncan’s post hoc test when significant. In all cases a P value < 0.05 was considered significant.

The clerodanes are a group of diterpenoids with interesting biological eﬀects such as antifungal,14 antileish- manial and antiplasmodial,15 antimalarial and antimycobac- terial,16 antitumor,17,18cytotoxic,1,14,16,19-31immunomodulatory,32 and trypanocidal activities.33 In our continuing investigation of the bioactive clerodane diterpenes from Casearia species, we undertook the ﬁrst phytochemical investigation of Casearia rupestris Eichler. This shrub or small tree grows up to 6.0 m in height and is found in Brazil (Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais States) and Bolivia (Sta. Cruz State) in the Cerrado, grasslands, and sometimes pastures, at altitudes of 350-500 m.34 Investiga- tion of the cytotoxic Et2O fraction yielded four new clerodane diterpenes (1-4) (Figure 1). Compounds 1 and 4 were acety- lated, resulting in two new derivatives (5, 6) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic activity of the diterpenes (1-6) against a panel of human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MDA/MB-435, HCT-8, and SF-295) has been evaluated. ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Investigation of the Et2O phase of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. rupestris led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, casearupestrins A-D (1-4). 2,7-Di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6) were obtained by acetylation of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. The structures (Figure 1) of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric data (IR, UV, NMR, and MS) and by comparison with NMR data of reported compounds.6 Casearupestrin A (1) was obtained as a white, amorphous solid ([R]24 D þ4.3 (c 1.0, MeOH)). The molecular formula Received: November 17, 2010 ABSTRACT: Four new clerodane diterpenes, casearupestrins A-D (1-4), were isolated from the leaves of Casearia rupestris. Compounds 1 and 4 were acetylated to yield 2,7-di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Casearupestrin A (1) exhibited the most potent activity against MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) cells, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin. 777 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 776–781 Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE C34H48O9 was determined by HRESIMS, based on the sodiated ion peak at m/z 623.3190 [M þ Na]þ (calcd 623.3190), which implies 11 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the presence of carbonyl esters (1746 and 1712 cm-1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions at λmax 223 nm (log ε 1.40) and 268 nm (log ε 1.50), corresponding to diene and dienone chromophores, respectively. The 13C and DEPT 135 NMR data showed the presence of 34 carbons divided into seven quaternary (including three carbonyl carbons), 13 methine, nine methylene, and ﬁve methyl carbons. The oleﬁnic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) revealed proton signals with characteristic cis/trans coupling at δH 5.06 (1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz, H-15), 5.30 (1H, d, J = 17.5 Hz, H-15), and 6.47 (1H, dd, J = 10.5, 17.5 Hz, H-14), indicating a terminal monosubstituted oleﬁnic moiety. Another terminal methylene, identiﬁed by two singlets at δH 4.94 and 5.03 (2H, H-16), was connected to a quaternary carbon (C-13). An additional oleﬁnic doublet was observed at δH 6.04 (1H, d, J = 4.0 Hz, H-3) and correlated to a methine carbon at δC 128.6 (C-3) in the gHMQC spectrum. Two deshielded acetal protons were observed at δH 6.35 (1H, t, J = 1.5 Hz, H-18) and 6.49 (1H, s, H-19), which correlated to methine signals at δC 96.3 and 99.8, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed the presence of two methyl groups at δH 1.06 (1H, brd, J = 4.0 Hz, H-17) and 1.07 (1H, s, H-20) and three oxymethines at δH 4.45 (1H, brt, J = 4.0 Hz, H-2), 5.18 (1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz, H-6), and 3.66 (1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz, H-7). The spectroscopic data of 1 (Tables 1 and 2) are in accord with the basic skeleton of clerodane diterpenoids previously isolated from Casearia species.10,18,35 The acyclic moiety at C-9, including the diene group, was deduced from the correlations of H-12 with C-11, H-14 with C-13 and C-16, H-15 with C-13 and C-14, and H-16 with C-14 (Figure 2). The position of the hydroxy group at C-7 was deduced by the long-range correlation of the oxy- methine signal at δH 3.66 (H-7) with δC 77.5 (C-6), 44.8 (C-8), and 11.7 (C-17) (Figure 2). A decadienoate moiety, identiﬁed by gHMBC and gCOSY correlations (Figure 2), was characterized by a Z- (δH 5.68, J = 11.5 Hz; 6.69, J = 11.5 Hz) and an E-double bond (δH 7.37, J = 14.0, 11.5 Hz; 6.16, J = 14.0, 7.0 Hz) and a triplet methyl (δH 0.98, J = 7.0 Hz). This same 2Z,4E-decadienoate unit has been veriﬁed in other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C. pitumba and C. arguta.6,36 Its position was determined at C-6 (δC 77.5), on the basis of the long-range correlation observed in the gHMBC spectrum between the oxymethine proton (H-6) and the carbonyl carbon (δC 167.3, C-10). Finally, since H-19 (δC 6.49) was correlated with the carbonyl group (δC 171.4) of one acetate unit, the second acetate unit (δC 171.8 and 21.0) must be located at C-18 (Figure 2). The relative conﬁguration of 1 was determined by using coupling constants, 1D-NOE data, and 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table 1 and Figure 3). The trans conﬁguration between the C-17 and C-20 methyl groups was shown by the chemical shift at δC 26.4 for C-20, which also supported a cis-A/B ring junction.3,5,10 The J values of 3.5 and 13.5 Hz for the coupling of H-10 and H-1 revealed that H-10 (rel-R) is in the axial position. The NOE enhancement between H-19 and H-10, and H-19 and H-7, indicated the same R-orientation to H-19 and H-7 (Figure 2). The large coupling constant between H-6 (δH 5.18 - 1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz) and H-7 (δH 3.66 - 1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz) supported their 1,2-diaxial relationship. The NOE interaction between H-6 (rel-β) and H-8 implied that H-8 and Me-17 were at axial and equatorial positions, respectively. A small coupling constant of 4.0 Hz for H-2/H-1 suggested an equatorial orientation for H-2 (rel-β), which was conﬁrmed by the broad triplet at δH 4.45 and the chemical shift of C-2 at δC 64.2. From the allylic coupling between H-3 and H-18 (J = 1.5 Hz) and NOE enhancement observed between H-18 and H-6 it can be deduced that H-18 also has a β-orientation. Therefore, casearupestrun A (1), a new clerodane diterpenoid, was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,- 8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-6-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,7-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The MS, UV, and IR data and the speciﬁc rotation value of casearupestrin B (2) were comparable with those of 1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Tables 1 and 2) revealed the same substituents and substitution patterns. However, changes in the chemical shift values related to H-6 (δH 3.75 - 1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz) and H-7 (δH 5.15 - 1H, t, J = 10.5 Hz) required placement of the decadienoate ester at C-7. The structure 2 was corroborated by the same correlations observed for 1 in the gHMQC, gHMBC, andgCOSY (Figure 2). The observed NOESY interactions and coupling constants for casearupestrin B (2) indicate the samerelative conﬁguration as 1 (Figure 3 andTable 1). Hence, casearupestrin B (2) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R, 9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,6-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The structures of the remaining two compounds can be ration- alized by comparison with the previous ones. Analysis of the NMR data of compound 3 revealed a strong similarity to com- pounds 1 and 2. However, the molecular formula C33H48O8, determined by the HRESIMS, revealed a sodiated ion peak at m/ z 595.3241 [M þ Na]þ, which implied 10 degrees of unsaturation. The main diﬀerence observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 3 in relation to compounds 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and 2) was the presence of signals at δH 3.36 (1H, s) and δC 55.4. These signals indicated that an acetoxy group at C-18 was replaced by a methoxy group, which was conﬁrmed by the gHMBC correlation between H-18 and the methoxy group. The relative conﬁguration of 3 was identical to 1 on the basis of the same NOESY interac- tions (Figure 3) and coupling constants. Thus, casearupestrin C (3) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-19-acetoxy-18, Figure 1. Structure of the clerodane diterpenes from Casearia rupestris. 778 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat.

Compound 4 had the molecular formula C36H50O10, deter- mined by HRESIMS (observed m/z 665.3297 [M þ Na]þ). The 1H and 13C NMR data of 4 (casearupestrin D) (Tables 1 and 2) were similar to those of 2 except for replacement of a hydroxy group at C-6 by an acetoxy group [δH 1.95 (3H, s), δC 171.5, δC 20.9]. The 1H and 13C NMR assignments of compound 4 were conﬁrmed by 2D NMR correlations, and its conﬁguration was established by the sign of the speciﬁc rotation, NOESY interac- tions, and coupling constants (Figure 3). Thus, casearupestrin D (4) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-6,18, 19-triacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)-decadienoyloxy]-2-hydro- xyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. Acetylation of 1 and 4 with Ac2O-pyridine yielded two new clerodane diterpenes derivatives, 5 and 6, respectively (Tables 1 and 2, NMR data). The products were named 2,7- di-O-acetylcasearupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearu- pestrin D (6). Theresultsofthebiologicaltestsofcompounds1-6areshownin Table 3. Casearupestrins A (1), B (2), and D (4) showed signiﬁcant cytotoxicity against four cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC50 values ranging from 0.10 to 1.3 μM. Com- pound 1 had an IC50 value of 0.36 μM against MDA/MB-435 and SF-295 cancer cell lines, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (Table 3). Acetylation of compounds 1 and 4 resulted in decreased cytotoxicity (Table 3), indicating that the C-2 OH group is essential for the cytotoxicity of these compounds. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 LC polarimeter. UV spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 A spectrometer.

Positive-ion HRMS spectra were recorded on an UltrOTOFq (Bruker Daltonics) ESI-qTOF mass spectrometer, using TFANa as the internal standard. Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 with UV-vis detector (model 330), using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Open column chromatography was performed over silica gel (40-63 μm, Merck) or silica C18 (40 μm, J. T. Baker) or on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were observed under UV light and by spraying the plates with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent, followed by heating at 120 C. Plant Material. Casearia rupestris leaves were collected in May 2007 in Campinas municipality, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil. The plant material was identified by one of the authors (R.B.T.). A voucher specimen (IAC41542) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Agron^omico de Campinas (S~ao Paulo State). Extraction, Isolation, and Chemical Transformation. The dried and ground leaves (0.46 kg) were exhaustively extracted by successive maceration with hexanes, EtOH, and H2O (3.0 L 3) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was concentrated under reduced pressure at 40 C to yield 30.0 g of a crude extract. This extract was then diluted with MeOH-H2O (3:1) and successively partitioned with hexanes (1.0 L 3), Et2O (1.0 L 3), and EtOAc (1.0 L 3). After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 10.8, 3.2, and 1.2 g, respectively. Part of the cytotoxic Et2O (3.0 g) fraction was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (78.0 3.0 cm) eluted with MeOH, to afford 38 fractions. These fractions were combined on the basis of their TLC profiles. Fraction 12 (1.7 g) was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel-C18, 78.0 3.0 cm, Table 2. 13C NMR Data for Compounds 1-6 (methanol-d4, 125 and 75 MHz, δ)a position 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.5, CH2 27.8, CH2 27.8, CH2 2 64.2, CH 64.2, CH 64.3, CH 64.0, CH 67.5, CH 67.4, CH 3 128.6, CH 127.0, CH 126.5, CH 129.3, CH 125.2, CH 125.3, CH 4 141.9, C 143.5, C 144.0, C 141.1, C 144.2, C 144.1, C 5 54.3, C 55.2, C 55.1, C 54.3, C 54.3, C 54.2, C 6 77.5, CH 75.2, CH 75.3, CH 75.8, CH 74.2, CH 75.6, CH 7 72.2, CH 76.1, CH 76.1, CH 73.5, CH 74.7, CH 73.4, CH 8 44.8, CH 43.1, CH 43.0, CH 42.7, CH 42.5, CH 42.5, CH 9 39.8, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 10 37.2, CH 36.5, CH 36.3, CH 37.3, CH 38.3, CH 38.3, CH 11 29.4, CH2 29.5, CH2 30.5, CH2 30.5, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 12 25.0, CH2 25.1, CH2 25.0, CH2 25.0, CH2 25.1, CH2 25.1, CH2 13 147.0, C 146.9, C 147.0, C 146.8, C 146.6, C 146.6, C 14 141.5, CH 141.6, CH 141.6, CH 141.5, CH 141.4, CH 141.4, CH 15 113.2, CH2 113.1, CH2 113.1, CH2 113.2, CH2 113.2, CH2 113.2, CH2 16 115.5, CH2 115.7, CH2 115.6, CH2 115.1, CH2 115.9, CH2 115.9, CH2 17 11.7, CH3 11.5, CH3 11.5, CH3 11.3, CH3 11.3, CH3 11.3, CH3 18 96.3, CH 97.2, CH 105.7, CH 96.0, CH 96.0, CH 95.9, CH 19 99.8, CH 100.1, CH 99.7, CH 99.5, CH 99.5, CH 99.5, CH 20 26.4, CH3 26.2, CH3 26.3, CH3 26.0, CH3 25.8, CH3 25.8, CH3 10 167.3, C 168.0, C 168.0, C 167.4, C 166.8, C 167.4, C 20 115.9, CH 116.3, CH 116.3, CH 115.7, CH 114.6, CH 115.1, CH 30 147.7, CH 147.1, CH 147.1, CH 148.1, CH 148.9, CH 148.2, CH 40 128.3, CH 128.3, CH 128.2, CH 128.0, CH 128.1, CH 128.0, CH 50 147.2, CH 146.9, CH 146.8, CH 148.0, CH 148.5, CH 148.0, CH 60 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 70 30.5, CH2 30.6, CH2 29.5, CH2 29.4, CH2 29.3, CH2 29.4, CH2 80 32.4, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 90 23.4, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.4, CH2 23.5, CH2 100 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 2-O2CCH3 172.1, C 21.0, CH3 172.1, C 21.0, CH3 6-O2CCH3 171.5, C 20.9, CH3 171.6, C 20.6, CH3 171.5, C 20.9, CH3 18-OCH3 55.4, CH3 18-O2CCH3 171.8, C 21.0, CH3 172.0, C 21.0, CH3 171.9, C 20.9, CH3 172.0, C 20.9, CH3 171.8, C 20.9, CH3 19-O2CCH3 171.4, C 21.8, CH3 171.5, C 21.8, CH3 171.9, C 21.9, CH3 171.9, C 21.9, CH3 170.9, C 21.7, CH3 171.0, C 21.7, CH3 a 13C NMR data were assigned by DEPT-135 and gHMQC experiments; multiplicities were determined with the assistance of DEPT-135 and 90 experiments. 780 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J.

Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes (1-6) was tested against four tumor cell lines: SF-295 (human glioblas- toma), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), HL-60 (human leukemia), and MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM gluta- mine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 C with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 μL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 μg/mL) dissolved in DMSO were added to each well. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 μg/mL) was used as the positive control. The proliferation of tumor cells was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan pro- duct. At the end of 69 h incubation, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL of MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA).37 ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.

Additionally, four known polyketides, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methoxyeugenin (6), and 9- hydroxyeugenin (7), were also isolated. The structural characterization of compounds was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy, time- dependent density functional theory calculations, and X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1−9 were weakly active when tested in antileishmanial and cytotoxicity assays. E ndophytic microorganisms live inside the tissues of host plants without apparently harming them and are a promising source of bioactive compounds.1−4 Species of Mycoleptodiscus, such as M. indicus, M. terrestris, and M. sphericus, are commonly isolated as endophytes; they are probably latently phytopathogenic and may become phytopa- thogenic when the host plant is subjected to stress.5 M. indicus, a tropical to subtropical species, occurs in leaves of diﬀerent host plants, mainly monocotyledons. M. indicus is associated with large spreading lesions on leaves of Zamia spp., an American cycad, and other monocotyledonous plants.6 M. indicus has occasionally been reported to infect humans and canines, causing septic arthritis and skin infections.7 In this paper, the isolation, structural characterization, and biological activity of secondary metabolites from cultures of M. indicus, an endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves from Borreria verticillata (Rubiaceae), are reported. Three new azaphilones, named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5), were isolated and fully characterized; in addition, four known polyketides, namely, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methox- yeugenin (6), and 9-hydroxyeugenin (7), were isolated and identiﬁed, and the acetylated derivatives of austdiol (8) and mycoleptone A (9) were synthesized (Figure 1). ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seven secondary metabolites of M. indicus were isolated, four of which were identiﬁed as austdiol, eugenitin, 6-methoxyeugenin, and 9-hydroxyeugenin by comparison of experimental spectro- scopic data with literature values.8−13 Austdiol ((7R,8S)-7,8- dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-6-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromene-5- carbaldehyde) is the main toxic component of a mixture of compounds produced in moldy maize meal by Aspergillus ustus and belongs to a class of compounds known generically as azaphilones.14,15 Azaphilones are yellow or orange pigments produced by fungi: their pyran oxygen atoms are easily exchanged to nitrogen atoms with ammonia, and the name is derived from the ready reaction of these metabolites with ammonia to yield vinylogous γ-pyridones.16 The skeleton of austdiol is derived from a single pentaketide chain, composed of Received: August 22, 2013 Published: January 3, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/jnp © 2014 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy 70 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np4006822 | J. Nat. Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 head-to-tail acetate units, and possesses two C1 units introduced from S-adenosylmethionine.17 A wide range of interesting biological activities of azaphilones, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, cytotoxic, nematicidal, and anti-inﬂammatory, have been reported in the literature;14,17 their nonselective biological activities may be related to the production of vinylogous γ-pyridones.18 Three of the isolated metabolites are previously unreported azaphilones and were named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5). Mycoleptone A (2) was isolated as a yellow powder, and the complete structural characterization was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high- resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy, time-dependent density func- tional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction studies (Figure 2). The UV spectrum of 2 displays maximum absorptions at 254 nm (log ε 2.90) and 361 nm (log ε 2.83), revealing the presence of an extended conjugated system, characteristic of azaphilones. Compound 2 displays similar 1H and 13C NMR spectra to austdiol,8,9 with the replacement of the aldehyde signals (δH 9.99 and δC 189.3) by methylene signals (δH 3.26 and δC 18.5) at position C-5. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibits two signals at δH 7.30 and 6.25 due to hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring, two hydroxyl hydrogens at δH 5.66 (OH, d, J = 4.6 Hz) and 4.93 (OH, s), a methine signal at δH 4.22 (1H, d, J = 4.6 Hz), a methylene signal at δH 3.26, and two methyl signals at δH 2.07 and 0.91. The 13C NMR spectrum displays signals for 12 carbons atoms, 11 of which refer to two atoms each: two signals due to methyl carbon atoms (δC 19.2 and 18.8), ﬁve signals from the skeleton of the pyran rings (δC 157.8; 143.5; 141.0; 120.7 and 104.6), and four signals from the skeleton of the cyclohexenone, with one signal due to ketone carbonyl groups (δC 197.8; IR νmax 1667 cm−1), one due to quaternary unsaturated carbon atoms (δC 112.7), and two due to oxygenated carbon atoms (δC 75.6 and 71.0). The remaining signal refers to a methylene group (δC 18.5). The heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) spec- trum shows key correlations of CH2-10 to C-4a, C-5, C-6, C- 4a′, C-5′, and C-6′, revealing the attachment of two azaphilone units through a methylene bridge at position C-5 (Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of four hydroxyl groups was conﬁrmed by acetylation with pyridine−Ac2O to aﬀord the tetraacetylated derivative (9). NMR spectroscopy identiﬁes the structure of 2 as being formed by two austdiol units linked by a methylene group, generating a compound with the molecular formula C23H24O8 as determined by HRMS ([M + H]+ at m/z 429.1543). The chemical structure explains the simplicity of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, in which the signal intensities are doubled, except for the methylene group. Compound 2 is a chiral molecule having four asymmetric carbons and a formal binary symmetry axis. An accurate analysis of the eight enantiomeric pairs of 2 reveals that two pairs are formed by nonoptically active meso structures and two more pairs are repeated twice; as a result, four pairs of enantiomers and two meso structures are possible. Since the reliable assessment of the absolute conﬁguration of a compound is achieved when the theoretical chiroptical properties19 of all the possible optically active diastereomers are determined,20 quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations were performed on four diastereomers of 2 (Figure 3): (7R,8S,7′R,8′S)-2 (2A), (7R,8S,7′R,8′R)-2 (2B), (7R,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2C), and (7S,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2D). QM calculations were carried out Figure 1. Mycoleptones A−C and polyketides from Mycoleptodiscus indicus. Figure 2. ORTEP representation of mycoleptone A (atom displace- ment at 30% probability). Hydrogen atoms are represented by spheres of arbitrary radius. Journal of Natural Products Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/np4006822 | J. Nat. Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 71 using density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent extension (TD-DFT); detailed results are reported in the Supporting Information. DFT geometry optimization (Table 2) yielded two equilibrium conformers having ΔEQM ≤2 kcal mol−1 for diastereomers 2A, 2B, and 2C, while a single equilibrium conformer within the same threshold energy was found for diastereomer 2D. The most populated conformers of 2A (Figure 4) display similar geometric features: the azaphilone units are oriented in an “open folder” conformation, the pyran oxygen atoms are pointing toward opposite directions, and all the hydroxy groups are equatorial and form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with each other and with the ketone carbonyl groups. The main diﬀerence lies in the direction of the axial methyl groups on C-7 and C-7′, which point outside the molecular cavity for 2A-e and inside for 2A-b. The experimental ECD spectrum of 2 in methanol (Figure 5) shows four bands. The broad positive band centered at 372 nm has a strong contribution from the n →π* transitions of the ketone carbonyls, which are aﬀected by the chiral environment around these groups. The positive band at 311 nm with a shoulder around 285 nm, the sharp negative peak at 252 nm, and the positive peak at 228 nm are due to π →π* transitions of the conjugated system, which are aﬀected by the chirality of the rings and by the mutual orientation of the azaphilone units. The theoretical ECD spectra of the diastereomers of 2 (Figure 6) displayed diﬀerent patterns, reﬂecting their diﬀerent stereochemistry. The comparison between the calculated spectrum of 2A and the experimental spectrum of 2 (Figure 7) shows that TD-DFT calculations are able to reproduce the experimental pattern of the transitions in the high-energy region, considering that transition energies are usually underestimated by PBE0.21 The transitions in the low- energy region are not reproduced, suggesting that QM calculations are unable to describe the chiral environment of the ketone moieties, in particular hydrogen-bonding inter- actions with hydroxy groups and solvent molecules, with adequate accuracy. On the other hand, the theoretical ECD spectra of the remaining diastereomers (reported in the Supporting Information) are unable to reproduce the experimental ECD pattern in the high-energy region: on this basis, a (7R,8S,7′R,8′S) absolute conﬁguration can be predicted for 2. Compound 2 crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2); the X-ray geometric parameters selected for comparison with the precursor austdiol are listed in Table 3. The C-5−C-10 distance was elongated upon change of hybridization to sp3 for atom C-10, and the C-5−C-4a distance was shortened, increasing the double-bond character. The pyran rings are almost planar with an rmsd from the mean plane of 0.03 Å, while the cyclohexenone rings adopt a twisted envelope conformation with atoms C-7 and C-7′ as ﬂap atoms. The X-ray structure of 2 shows that the azaphilone units have the same absolute conﬁguration as austdiol,22 retaining the stereochemistry of the chiral centers as (7R,8S); moreover, Table 1.

On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the structure of mycoleptone A (2) was therefore elucidated as (7R,8S,7′R,8′S)-5-[(7′,8′-dihydroxy-3′,7′-dimeth- yl-6′-oxo-7′,8′-dihydro-6′H-isochromen-5′-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihy- droxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromen-6-one. The molecular formula of mycoleptone B (4) was determined as C23H24O8 by a combination of HRMS, 1H and 13C NMR, homonuclear correlation (COSY), heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC), and HMBC spectros- copies. The 1H NMR spectrum contains ﬁve doublets, four singlets, two double doublets, and one multiplet; some similarities with the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 are observed, with the presence of two hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring at δH 7.43 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz) and 6.63 (1H, s), an oxygenated sp3 methine group at δH 4.42 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz), a CH2 group at δH 3.60 (1H, d, Jgem = 15.0 Hz) and 3.53 (1H, d, Jgem = 15.0 Hz) due to the methylene bridge at position C-10 connecting the azaphilone unit to a dihydroisocoumarin moiety, and two methyl signals at δH 2.22 and 1.10. For the dihydroisocoumarin moiety, the 1H NMR spectrum displays an oxygen-bearing methine hydrogen at δH 4.55 (1H, m), a methylene group at δH 3.17 (1H, dd, J = 16.0, 3.0 Hz) and 2.60 (1H, dd, J = 16.0, 11.0 Hz), and two methyl groups at δH 2.06 (3H, s) and 1.44 (3H, d, J = 6.2 Hz). The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 displays signals for 23 carbon atoms: one signal due to the methylene bridge (δC 20.7), 11 signals belonging to the azaphilone moiety as in 2, Figure 3.

The structural features of the lactone ring were determined from the 1H−1H COSY spectrum based on the couplings between H2-4′ and H-3′, as well as between H-3′ and H3-9′. The HMBC correlations of CH2-4′ to δC 136.8 (C-5′), δC 100.1 (C-8a′), δC 75.0 (C-3′), and δC 19.6 (C-9′) proved the connection of the two units. In addition, the HMBC spectrum displays relevant correlations from CH2-10 (δH 3.60, 3.53) to δC 199.3 (C-6), 143.7 (C-4a), and 112.8 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δC 160.9 (C-8′), 160.2 (C-6′), and 116.5 (C-7′) from the dihydroiso- coumarin moiety, characterizing the connection between the two units by a methylene bridge to aﬀord the compound (7R,8S)-5-[(6′,8′-dihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethyl-1′-oxoisochroman- 7′-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-iso- chromen-6-one. The molecular formula of mycoleptone C (5) was deduced as C23H22O8 by HRMS analysis in combination with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The 1H NMR spectrum displays nine singlets and two doublets; as in compounds 2 and 4, the methylene group at δH 3.74 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) and 3.46 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) connects two moieties, the azaphilone and chromone units. The azaphilone moiety shows ﬁve uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δH 7.52 (H-1), 7.03 (H-4), 4.25 (H-8), 2.25 (H-9), and 1.00 (H-10); the chromone moiety displays four uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δH 13.06 (H-5′), 6.13 (H-3′), 2.37 (H-9′), and 2.00 (H-10′), the sharp singlet at δH 13.06 being interpreted as a hydrogen-bonded phenol hydroxy group. The 13C NMR spectrum conﬁrms 23 carbon signals, namely, four methyl, one methylene, four methine, and 14 quaternary carbon signals. The chromone moiety displays one ketone carbonyl group (δC 181.8; IR νmax 1690 cm−1) and four quaternary aromatic (δC 153.5, 107.8, 105.0, and 103.1), two oxygenated aromatic (δC 161.1 and 156.6), two unsaturated (δC 167.2 and 107.9), and two methyl (δC 20.2 and 8.5) carbon atoms. The structure of the chromone portion was determined on consideration of the molecular formula, double-bond equivalents, and the downﬁeld shifts of the carbon signals at C-2′ and C-8a′ (δC 167.2 and 153.5). The HMBC spectrum of 5 revealed relevant correlations of CH2-10 (δH 3.74, 3.46) to δC 200.5 (C-6), 144.3 (C-4a), and 112.1 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δC 161.1 (C-7′), 156.6 (C-5′), and 107.8 (C-6′) from the chromone moiety, revealing the Figure 5.

The presence of a methylene bridge is very uncommon among natural compounds, and only a few azaphilone dimers have been reported showing such a feature.15 Dicitrinones A− C23 were isolated from Penicillium citrinum, a volcano ash- derived fungus: the presence of a single sp3 carbon bridge, either a methine or methylene group, was proposed to derive from the carboxyl group of citrinin through decarboxylation, reduction, and Friedel−Crafts alkylation mediated by a polyketide biosynthetic pathway. The methylene bridge in aspergilone B,24 an azaphilone dimer that was isolated from a marine-derived fungus of the Aspergillus species, was hypothe- sized to derive from a formaldehyde biosynthetic pathway; the same hypothesis was proposed for the biosynthesis of xyloketal F,25 a dimer isolated from a mangrove fungus of the Xylaria species. The condensation of two austdiol units to form mycoleptone A (2) is consistent with a possible biosynthetic pathway similar to the one proposed for dicitrinone C23 (Figure 8). One austdiol unit may undergo decarbonylation, while the aldehyde group of the second austdiol unit may be reduced to a reactive carbocation species: the two units may then react by Friedel− Crafts alkylation. Similar pathways may also explain the condensation of the dihydroisocoumarin and chromone units with an austdiol unit in mycoleptones B (4) and C (5), respectively. Due to the limited number of methylene-bridged azaphilones discovered to date, however, a general biosynthetic pathway cannot be postulated, and the biologically mediated mechanisms of such reactions are unknown. The results of antileishmanial and cytotoxicity tests on the isolated compounds are shown in Table 4. Compounds 1−9 exhibit no signiﬁcant activity against Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major compared to the standard antileishmanial drugs Geneticin (L. major), amphotericin B, and pentamidin (L. donovani). Mycoleptone B (4) was the most cytotoxic metabolite (PC3 cells: IC50 = 7.1 ± 3.8 μM), but its activity was lower than that of doxorubicin, the reference compound for cytotoxicity assays. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured in CHCl3, MeOH, or DMSO using a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter at room temperature; IR spectra were recorded with KBr discs using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer. UV spectra were measured in CHCl3, MeOH, and DMSO on a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV−visible spectrophotometer. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp multisolvent delivery system, a SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector, an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection, and processing, and a Shim-pack CLC- ODS(M) reversed-phase column (250 × 4.5 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size) protected by a Pelliguard LC-18 cartridge. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 13C NMR in CDCl3, CD3OD, or DMSO-d6; multiplicity determinations (DEPT) and 2D NMR spectra (COSY, HMQC, and HMBC) were obtained using standard Bruker pulse programs. The chemical shift values (δ) are given in parts per million (ppm), and the coupling constants are in Hz. HRMS were obtained by direct injection using a Bruker Bioapex FTMS spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI). UV and ECD spectra of 2 in MeOH (sample concentration: 19 μM) were recorded in the 500−215 nm spectral range on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter, using a 1 cm path length cell at room temperature: measurements Figure 8.

Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 75 were carried out at 0.2 nm intervals using a 1 nm spectral bandwidth, a 20 nm min−1 scan rate, and a 4 s time constant. Fungal Material. The fungus was isolated as an endophyte from the medicinal plant Borreria verticillata (L.) G. F. W. Meyer, belonging to the Rubiaceae family, and is native to South America. Five specimens of B. verticillata with a healthy appearance were collected from the campus of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) (34°56′57″ W; 8°2′53″ S) in January 2006, approximately 43 cm in height and bearing ﬂowers. Then, the samples were taken to the laboratory and processed in 24 h. A voucher specimen of the plant (No. 42.234/UFPE) was identiﬁed and deposited at the Herbarium Professor Geraldo Mariz, UFP, Department of Botany, UFPE, Recife, Brazil. The isolate was identiﬁed as Mycoleptodiscus indicus based on sequence analysis of the ITS region of the rDNA (GenBank accession number GU220382.1). Cultivation, Extraction, and Isolation. M. indicus was grown on potato dextrose agar plates for 7 days at 30 °C. Then, 10 plugs were transferred to ﬁve Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 100 mL of potato dextrose broth prepared with distilled water. Flasks were shaken on a rotary shaker at 30 °C and 120 rpm for 48 h. Next, 10 mL was transferred to each of 50 ﬂasks containing 90 g of solid medium (rice-oat). These were grown for 30 days. On day 30, the mycelial mass was macerated with ethanol overnight and ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was concentrated under vacuum to obtain a crude ethanol extract (22 g), which was partitioned with three times equal volumes of hexane and CH2Cl2, respectively, yielding hexane (6 g) and dichloromethane fractions (6.9 g). The CH2Cl2 fraction was suspended in MeOH and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, furnishing a precipitate fraction (3870 mg) and a soluble fraction (3030 mg). The precipitate fraction was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (30 × 3.5 cm i.d.) using a MeOH−CH2Cl2 gradient to yield 67 fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles into seven fractions: A (19 mg), B (33 mg), C (2968 mg), D (100 mg), E (210 mg), F (285 mg), and G (109 mg). Fraction C (2968 mg) yielded austdiol (2830 mg), after crystallization in MeOH, and fraction E aﬀorded mycoleptone A (2, 200 mg) by precipitation. The soluble fraction (3030 mg) was subjected to gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 × 3 cm i.d.) using MeOH as the mobile phase, furnishing 10 fractions (S1−S10). Fraction S6 (280 mg) was washed with MeOH, yielding eugenitin (50 mg). The soluble portion was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) using a MeOH−CH2Cl2 gradient. Forty-two fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles to yield nine fractions. The fourth fraction (S6.4, 28 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane−ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to furnish mycoleptone B (4, 10 mg) and mycoleptone C (5, 2 mg). Fraction S5 (461 mg) was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) eluted with a gradient of MeOH in CH2Cl2. Thirty fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles to yield 10 fractions. The fourth fraction (S5.4, 60 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane−ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to provide 6-methoxyeugenin (14 mg). The ﬁfth fraction (S5.5, 4 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using CH3CN−H2O (10:90 to 100:0, v/v) as mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min over 23 min, yielding 9-hydroxyeugenin (2 mg). Acetylation of Austdiol and Mycoleptone A (2). A solution containing austdiol (80 mg), pyridine (2 mL), and Ac2O (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. H2O (6 mL) was added into the reaction mixture, which was subsequently extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was evaporated to give a yellow, amorphous solid (140 mg), which was puriﬁed by preparative TLC eluted with a mixture of CH2Cl2−MeOH (98:2, v/v) to aﬀord the diacetylated derivative (8, 80.7 mg). Acetylation of mycoleptone A (2, 25 mg) was performed in a similar manner, yielding the tetraacetylated derivative (9, 20 mg). Quantum-Mechanical Calculations. Conformational analysis on the selected diastereomers of 2 was performed in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, a preliminary conformer distribution was determined by molecular mechanics (MM) calculations at the MMFF94s26 level using the Spartan’02 software.27 In the second step, DFT28,29 geometry optimizations were performed on the MM conformers having relative energies (ΔEMM) within a threshold value of 3 kcal mol−1. DFT calculations were carried out at the B97D/6-311+ +G(2d,2p) level30−33 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 The Boltzmann distribution of conformers at 298.15 K and 1 atm was then calculated from the relative electronic energies (ΔEQM). TD-DFT35 calculations were carried out at the PBE0/6-311++G(2d,2p) level31−33,36−38 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 All calculations were performed using the IEFPCM continuum solvation model39,40 for MeOH. Rotational strengths (Rj) and excitation wavelengths (λj) were calculated for the lowest 50 excited states on the optimized geometries having ΔEQM ≤2 kcal mol−1. Theoretical ECD spectra were then obtained by approximation of Rj values to Gaussian functions with a half-bandwidth at Δεmax/e (Δσ) of 0.3 eV, summation over all excited states, and conformational averaging, according to the Boltzmann distribution of conformers (χQM).41 Crystallographic Structure. Crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by crystallization from a methanol solution. A colorless prismatic crystal of approximate dimensions 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3 was used for the experiment. X-ray data were measured on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diﬀractometer employing graphite-monochro- mated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 298 K and operating in the φ−ω scan mode. Crystal data: C23H24O8, M = 428.42, triclinic, space group P1, a = 10.473(6) Å, b = 11.223(3) Å, c = 11.429(2) Å, α = 60.65(2)°, β = 89.83(3)°, γ = 67.75(4)°, V = 1055.5(9) Å3, Z = 2, Dc = 1.348 g/cm3, F(000) = 452, and μ(Cu Kα) = 0.86 mm−1. All tested crystal samples showed gemination, and the sample used for data collection was visually homogeneous, but it showed pseudomerohedral twinning, which caused partial superposition of structure factors leading to high residuals during the structure reﬁnements. A total of 8384 reﬂections were collected (4273 unique plus 96.2% of Friedel mates) in the θ range 4.56° to 73.92° and index ranges h from 15 to −15, k from −24 to 25, and l from −15 to 15. Cell reﬁnement and data reduction were performed with the XCAD4 software suite. The structure was solved and reﬁned using the WingX with SHELX97 suite.42,43 Structure reﬁnement was performed on F2 by full-matrix least-squares calculations. Non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned aniso- tropically, and all hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized coordinates and reﬁned as riding atoms with isotropic parameters relative to their parent atoms. The ﬁnal reﬁnement residuals were R1 = 0.091 (wR2 = 0.32) for 6964 observed reﬂections with I > 2σ(I), 575 variable parameters, and three restraints, being R1 = 0.11 (wR2 = 0.32) for all unique reﬂections with GoF = 1.41. The absolute structure Flack parameter was 0.1(3), indicating that the chiral sense was correctly chosen, although this number was not reliable, given the large standard deviation, in the absence of strong anomalous scatterers. Biological Assays. The microplate Alamar-Blue assay was used to determine growth inhibition against L. donovani.44 Antileishmanial (L. major) and cytotoxicity assays against human colon cancer (HCT-8) cells, human leukemia cancer (HL-60) cells, human melanoma cancer (MDA-MB435) cells, human prostate cancer (PC3) cells, human glioblastoma cancer (SF-95) cells, and human lymphocyte cells were assessed employing a colorimetric method.45 Austdiol (1): yellow crystal; mp 255−257 °C; [α]25 D +223 (c 1.0, DMSO); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 212 (2.64), 255 (2.57), 333 (2.62) nm; IR (KBr) νmax 3470, 3373, 3100, 1679, 1604, 1471 cm−1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR reported in the Supporting Information; HRMS m/z 237.0759 [M + H]+ (calcd for C12H12O5 + H+, 237.0757).

Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed signiﬁcant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Com- pounds 1−4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three diﬀerent strains of P. falciparum in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsins B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases. F or thousands of years, plants have been used as medicines. They represent a source of structurally complex and unusual substances and are therefore an extremely attractive target for chemical and biological studies. One of the rational forms of study in the search for new potential drugs can be through screening, where a wide variety of extracts can be used for speciﬁc biological tests to obtain one or more metabolites with pharmacological potential.1 Metrodorea stipularis belongs to the family Rutaceae, a family that has a wide diversity of metabolites with large structural diversity that expresses diﬀerent pharmacological properties. Only two species of the Metrodorea genus have been investigated for their chemical constituents: M. nigra and M. flavida. M. nigra is the only species shown to contain dihydrochalcones. In addition to Metrodorea, Esenbeckia is, as of yet, the only genus found to produce this class of compound in the Rutaceae family.2−4 Chagas disease aﬀects 8 million people in Latin America, leading to an annual economic loss of approximately $18 billion. This disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. There are only two drugs used for the treatment of this disease, nifurtimox and benznidazole. The former has been banned in some countries of South America, and both cause serious side eﬀects. Cruzipain (cruzain) is an enzyme that participates in the pathway of proteolytic digestion of the parasite and plays an essential role in its life process; thus, it is an interesting biological target in the search for new compounds that can be used in the treatment of this disease.5−8 Plasmodium falciparum is the most malignant of the species causing malaria, and the progressive increase of resistant parasite strains to antimalarials has initiated studies aimed at developing new drugs that may help in the chemotherapy of this disease. Artemisinin and quinine used in the treatment of this disease are plant natural products.9 Cathepsins are cysteine proteases involved in several pathological situations, such as in the progression of malignant tumors and metastases, infectious disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. The malignant tumors are mostly nonencapsulated and invasive, making it diﬃcult for surgical resection. Evidence suggests that cathepsins B and L may facilitate the progression of tumors, and studies of the expression of these enzymes in diﬀerent types of cancer have shown an increase in the expression of cathepsins in humans.10,11 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In a search for new antichagasic compounds, extracts from several Brazilian plants of the Rutaceae family were evaluated against cruzain. The dichloromethane fraction from liquid− Received: June 4, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/jnp © XXXX American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy A dx.doi.org/10.1021/np500453x | J. Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX liquid partitioning of the crude ethanol extract from the stems of M. stipularis showed the most promising results, with inhibition of 80% against cruzain at a concentration of 100 μg/ mL. Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6- trihydroxyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1- (5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dime- thylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)- phenyl]propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H- xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2 Compounds 2 and 3 were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESITOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at m/ z 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for 2 and 3, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C25H30O5 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for 2 and 3 showed one singlet at δ 5.92 attributed to H-8′, the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both 2 and 3 the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at δ 1.76 (H-3′) and 2.53 (H-4′) and the methyl groups at δ 1.33 (H-9′ and H-10′). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at δ 6.91 (H-5″ and H-7″) and 6.56 (H-8″) for 2 and signals at δ 6.87 (H-2″), 6.83 (H-6″), and 6.64 (H-5″) for 3 assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound 2 showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at δ 1.73 (H-3″) and 2.69 (H-4″) and the signals of the methyl groups at δ 1.22 (H-8″ and H-9″). Compound 3 displayed one prenyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at δ 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4‴ and H-5‴), one oleﬁnic hydrogen at δ 5.28 (H-2‴), and the methylene signal at δ 3.25 (H-1‴). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in 1 and conﬁrmed the structures of 2 and 3. Compound 4 was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESITOFMS data showed the molecular ion at m/z 478.2714 (calculated m/z 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O5. As mentioned for compounds 2 and 3, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the character- istic signals of the three methyl groups at δ 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at δ 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and conﬁrmed the structure of 4. The dihydrochalcones 1−4 showed inhibition activities against cruzain, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the ﬁrst report of cruzain inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies. Dihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochal- cones 1 and 3 showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these com- pounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more eﬀective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydro- chalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsins such as cathepsin K.12 The dihydrochalcones were also tested against Plasmodium falciparum growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against P. falciparum the dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 showed signiﬁcant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 μM for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against P. falciparum growth for this class of compounds. Four compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases cruzain and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The results described in this paper are signiﬁcant, since this is the ﬁrst report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against cruzain, and it is interesting that compounds 2 and 4 are active against cathepsin B, while compounds 1 and 3 are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of ﬁnding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. All commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co., and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-d6 and methanol-d4, using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe ATMA). MS data were colledted on a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF-Q II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H2SO4/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230−700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna). Plant Materials. The stems of Metrodorea stipularis were collected in July 2010 at the Agronomic Institute in Campinas, SP; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute. Journal of Natural Products Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/np500453x | J. Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B Extraction and Isolation. The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 °C, aﬀording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid−liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against cruzain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed signiﬁcant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromato- graphed over silica gel 60 (φ = 5.0 cm × h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10:0, 15:5, 5:5, 0:10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1− MSD24). Fraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15_1− MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg). Fraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 3.0 cm × h = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD21_1−MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD21_8_1−MSD21_8_20). Subfraction MSD21_8_12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21_8_19 (9 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, φ = 1.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/ACN/H2O (4:1:5) as mobile phase and a ﬂow of 3.5 mL/min to aﬀord 4 (2.5 mg). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2066 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3- methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl]propan-1-one (3): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2040 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl- 2,3,4,4a, 9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4): amor- phous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 2; ESITOFMS m/z 478.2714 (calcd for C30H38O5 m/z 478.2720). Enzyme Inhibition Assays. Cruzain. All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectroﬂuorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured by the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanylarginine-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide). The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.3) with 5 μL of DTT at 37 °C after addition of 2 μL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control).

Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic ﬂuorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and a concentration of 185 μM for catB and 10 μM for catL. The enzyme was activated for 5 min with DTT and acetate buﬀer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 200 μL, kept under stirring (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with at least seven inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot 12.0. Bioassay of Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth. The strains 3D7, W2, and Dd2 of P. falciparum malaria parasites (BEI Resources, MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in human type O+ erythrocytes in complete medium (RPMI 1640 (Cellgro), 0.043 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 0.014 mg/mL hypoxanthine (Acros), 38.5 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.18% NaHCO3 (Cellgro), 0.20% Glucose (MP Biomedical), 0.003 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.2% Albumax (Gibco), 5% human serum) as previously described.14 Brieﬂy, cultures were maintained in 25 cm3 ﬂasks (Corning) at a volume of 10 mL and were gassed for 30 s with an environment of 3% CO2, 1% O2, and 96% N2, then incubated at 37 °C. The antimalarial activity was determined with a SYBR Green based parasite proliferation assay, adapted from Smilkstein15 and Bennett.16 Using this technique, the increase of parasite DNA contained in human red blood cells was measured after 72 h of incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds.17 Relative ﬂuorescence values were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM ﬂuorimeter (excitation 495 nm and emission 525 nm).

VIEIRA, ISAO KUBO* Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natwal Resomes, Uniwsity of Califmnia, Bn;bley, Califmnia 94720 HIROSHI KUJIME, YOSHIRO YAMAGIWA, and TADAO KAMIKAWA+ Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Tabnology, Kinki Unimity, Kowaka, Higasbiosaka-shi, Osaka 5 77, Japan ABSTRACT.-TWO novel acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [l] and cusculine [2], were iso- lated from the CH,CI, extract of the leaves ofAngostwapanirrrlataa (Rutaceae). Their structures were established as l-hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethoxy-9-acridone for 1 and 1,2,3,5,6-pen- tamethoxy-9-acridone for 2 by means of spectroscopic studies, in particular nmr. These struc- tural assignments were confirmed by synthesis, using a direct metallation method as a key reac- tion. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against an aquatic snail, B i a - phalaria glabratu, and cytotoxicity against several types of carcinoma cell lines. We have recently described the isolation of various alkloids from Brazilian Rutace- ous plants: two molluscicidal quinoline alkaloids from the leaves of Gafipeu brarteata (l), and two insect-growth-inhibitory 4-quinolinone alkaloids from the leaves of Esen- hkia feiocarpa (2). In our continuing search for biologically active phytochemicals, two novel acridone alkaloids have been isolated from the leaves of another Brazilian Rutace- ous plant, Angosturapanicufata (Engler) Elias. These alkaloids exhibited moderate mol- luscicidal and cytotoxic activities and were designated cuspanine El} and cusculine [21. Their structures were established based largely on nmr studies. However, the structures established are rather uncommon among the known acridone alkaloids. Therefore, in order to confirm the structures, their syntheses were carried out. This paper reports the isolation, structure determination, and syntheses of 1 and 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION After repeated and various column chromatographies, the CH,Cl, extract of the leaves ofA. panicufata yielded two new acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [I] and cusculine 121. In conjunction with both 'H- and ',C-nmr and eims data, the molecular formula C1,Hl,NO6 was assigned to cuspanine 111. In addition, together with the uv and ir data, an acridone-type structure could be assigned to cuspanine. This was apparent be- cause keto group signals, characteristic of acridone at 6 181.14 (s) and 1635 cm-', were observed. The presence of a free phenolic group was deduced from the uv spectrum by using AICI, as the shift reagent. Thus, when afew drops ofAIC1, solution was added to cuspanine in MeOH, a typical bathochromic shift was observed. However, the re- gion of 3000-3600 cm-' in the ir spectrum showed only weak and broad absorption, because the phenolic group forms a stable 6-membered ring intramolecular hydrogen bond with the keto group. The 'H-nmr spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic proton sig- nals at 6 6.92 and 8.06 ( J = 8.0 Hz for each) which can be attributed to H-7 and H-8, respectively (3). This indicated the tetrasubstituted nature of ring C. The remaining signal at 6 6.23 (s) could be attributed to the aromatic proton at either H-2 or H-4. This was confirmed by 'H nmr using nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY). In the NOESY spectrum of cuspanine, an nOe was observed between the aromatic proton H-4 at 6 6.23 and the amine proton at 6 8.44. This result, itself, was conclusive for the assignment of the remaining proton to the 4 position in ring C.

Therefore, the structure 1 was proposed for cuspanine. Cusculine E21 is very closely related to cuspanine Ill. The only difference observed in the 'H-nmr spectrum was an additional peak for an M e 0 group, suggesting the pres- ence of five M e 0 groups in the molecule. In addition to this observation, the batho- chromic shift observed in the uv spectrum of 1 was not detected with 2, indicating that an Me0 group was substituted for the phenolic group of 1. This was further supported by the 13C-nmr spectrum which showed three signals in lower field at 6 61.89, 61.53, and 60.94, indicating the presence of three hindered Me0 groups (4) and leading to structure 2 for cusculine. Cuspanine 121, 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone, was synthesized from 2- bromo-3,Cdimethoxybenzoic acid [6]. The first method that was tried for the prepara- tion of 6 was the bromination of isovanillin in refluxing CHCI,, followed by methyla- tion (Me,S04) and oxidation (Jones' reagent). However, the bromination gave a poor yield (18%), so the following alternate approach, using a directed metallation method, was adopted. 1114 Journal of Natural Products Wol. 55, No. 8 The methoxymethyl ether (MOM ether) 141, prepared from 3,4dimethoxybenzyl alcohol [3] and methoxymethyl chloride, was lithiated in Et,O with n-butyllithium at 0\". The resulting yellow precipitates were treated with 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane (5) at -78', and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature to give a bromide 5 with a 66% yield. Hydrolysis of the MOM ether of 5 with HBr in warm EtOH, fol- lowed by oxidation with Jones' reagent, gave 6 in a 69% yield. Ullmann condensation (6) of 6 and 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline [7l in the presence of freshly prepared copper powder and K,C03 in DMF gave 8 with a 56% yield appearing as orange plates. Treat- ment of 8 with polyphosphoric acid and xylene (7) at 150' gave 2 in the form of yellow prisms with a yield of 55%. Selective hydrolysis of the 1-MeO group of 2 was achieved by refluxing in MeOH with concentrated HCl and 70% HC104 to afford 1 (Scheme 1). The physical data for both 1 and 2 were identical with those of the natural products. The structure of 1 was unambiguously determined by a single crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 1). FIGURE 1. Molecular structure of 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acri- done [Z] from X-ray crystallography. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail Bimphakaria gkbrata. The LC5, of cuspanine fl] was 5 ppm and that of cusculine 121 was 20 ppm. There are only a few examples in the literature (8,9) where alkaloids exhibiting high toxicity to snails are observed. These two alkaloids also showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several carcinoma cell lines. The IC5,'s of 1 and 2 against HeIa epithelioid carcinoma cells were 2.5 and 8.5 pg/ml, respectively. In addition, they also inhibited the growth of BT-20 human breast carcinoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.-AII the pnxedures were the same as previously de- scribed (2). ISOLATION OF CONSTITUENTs.-The leaves ofA. pnicvhtu were collected in Minas erais, Brazil, in February 1988, and identified by Dr. Jd R. Pirani, Instituto de BiociEncias, Universidade de So Paulo, So Paulo, SP. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium ofthis institute. The dried pul- verized leaves were first extracted with CH2C12 followed by MeOH at ambient temperature. A subsequent molluscicidal bioassay using B . gkzbrata indicated the CH2CI, extract to be active. The CH2CI, extract (2.983 g) was chromatographed over Si gel, using CH,CI,, EtOAc, and MeOH. This process yielded 11 fractions. The bioactive fraction, eluted with EtOAc, was rechromatographed over Si gel (Lichroprep), af- fording c u s p i n e [l] (60 mg). The fractions eluted with MeOH after the same procedure gave cusculine 121 (200 mg).

CELL LINES AND MEDIA.-AII cell lines used for the assay were purchased from American Type Cul- ture Collection (Rockville, MD). They are HeLa ATCC CCL 2 19, epithelioid cerevix carcinoma from human, and BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma from human. Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-in- activated fetal calf serum, and incubated in a humidified atomosphere of 5% C02-95% air at 37\". These human monolayer cultures were subcultured with a 0.25% trypsidEDTA solution. CYTOTOXICITY ASSAY.-The cytotoxicity assays were performed by a microculture tetrazolium (h4YY) (Sigma) method (12). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtitre plates at 4@304000 celldwell, with various concentrations ofthe samples. After incubation, 50 pl MlT(3 mglml in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye ws solubilized by adding 100 pl DMSO to each well, fol- lowed by gentle shaking. The extinction ccef6cient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photome- ter Labsystems, at a wavelength of 620 run. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. Jd R.

Chagasʼ disease (American trypanosomiasis) af- fects 16–18 million people, mostly from Central and South America, where 25% of the total popu- lation are at risk of infection [1]. The treatment of Chagasʼ disease is still a challenge, since the cur- rently available drugs, nifurtimox (Lampit®, dis- continued by Bayer), a nitrofuran derivative, and benznidazole (Rochagan®, Roche), a nitroimida- zole derivative, have shown limited efficacy, strong side effects, and low effectiveness [2]. The Peperomia genus belongs to the Piperaceae family and consists of approximately 1700 spe- cies [3]. In contrast to the extensive studies in- volving compounds isolated from Piper species [4,5], only a few species of Peperomia have been subjected to systematic phytochemical investiga- tion. Peperomia obtusifolia is a well-known orna- mental plant distributed from Mexico to South America. A previous phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of P. obtusifolia showed the presence of five phenolic compounds bearing methyl, prenyl and geranyl groups [6]. This study describes the isolation and in vitro evaluation of the trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi (Y-strain) and unspecific cyto- toxicity of seven known compounds (l \" Fig. 1) from the active fractions of the ethanol extracts of Peperomia obtusifolia leaves and stems. This is the first report of the isolation of compound 2, the chromane 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-di- methyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl- 1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylic acid, from Peperomia obtusifolia. Materials and Methods ! Plant material Leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia A. Diet- er were collected in Poços de Caldas, MG, Brazil and identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). The voucher speci- men (KATO 070) has been deposited at the Her- bário do Estado “Maria Eneyda P. Kaufmann Fidal- go” (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Abstract ! The trypanocidal activity of crude extracts and fractions from the leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia (Piperaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most active extracts afforded seven known com- pounds, including three chromanes, two furofur- an lignans and two flavone C-diglycosides. The most active compounds were the chromanes pe- perobtusin A and 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-di- methyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl- 1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylic acid, with IC50 values of 3.1 µM (almost three times more active than the positive control benz- nidazole, IC50 10.4 µM) and 27.0 µM, respectively. Cytotoxicity assays using peritoneal murine mac- rophages indicated that the chromanes were not toxic at the level of the IC50 for trypanocidal activ- ity. This is the first report on the trypanocidal ac- tivity besides unspecific cytotoxicity of chro- manes from Peperomia species. Additionally it represents the first time isolation of 3,4-dihydro- 5-hydroxy-2,7-dimethyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-buten- yl)-2-(4′-methyl-1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzo- pyran-6-carboxylic acid from P. obtusifolia.

Extraction and isolation The powdered air-dried leaves (600 g) and stems (64 g) were ex- tracted at room temperature with EtOH (4 × 2500 mL, 72 h each and 4 × 500 mL, 72 h each; respectively). The crude leaves extract (39.6 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of H2O/ MeOH (20:80 v/v) and partitioned using Hex (3 × 35 mL), Hex/ EtOAc (30:70 v/v) (3 × 35 mL) and EtOAc (3 × 35 mL), which af- forded EL‑H, EL‑HE, EL‑E and EL‑MH fractions, respectively. EL‑H (15.5 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20–63 µm, 7 × 15 cm) eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc and EtOAc-MeOH (3 L and 1.5 L, respectively), yielding 26 frac- tions (170 mL each, A-1 to A-26). Compound 1 (50 mg) was ob- tained from A-7 (320 mg) by recrystallization in MeOH (45°C). EL‑HE (2.2 g) was submitted to low-pressure column chromatog- raphy over a C18 column (4 × 18 cm), under gradient elution (5– 100% MeOH in H2O) (1.5 L) yielding 14 fractions (100 mL each, B-1 to B-14). B-7 (232.8 mg) after semipreparative reversed phase HPLC (C18, 10 µm, 250 mm × 21.2 mm, MeOH/H2O 65:35 v/v, flow-rate 16 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm), yielded 2 (40 mg, Rt = 19.8 min). Compounds 3 (6 mg, Rt = 7.8 min) and 4 (7.2 mg, Rt = 12.4 min) were purified from B- 9 (160.0 mg) under the same conditions as for B-7. EL‑MH (10.8 g) was subjected to low-pressure column chroma- tography over a C18 column (5 × 28 cm), under gradient elution (5–100% MeOH in H2O) affording 14 fractions (C-1 to C-14). C-8 and C-9 (165 and 168 mg, respectively) were pooled and then subjected to semipreparative HPLC (phenyl-hexyl, 10 µm, 250 mm × 21.2 mm, MeOH/AcOH aqueous 0.5%, 22:78 v/v, flow rate 14 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm) to yield 5 (23 mg, Rt = 20 min). The stems ethanol extract (5.7 g) was dissolved in 60 mL of H2O/ MeOH (20:80 v/v) and partitioned using hexane, EtOAc and n- BuOH (3 × 20 mL each) to give ES‑H, ES‑E and ES‑B fractions, re- spectively. ES‑H (2 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20–63 µm, 3 × 12 cm) eluted with hexane-EtOAc and an EtOAc-MeOH gradient (300 mL and 150 mL, respectively), to afford 13 fractions (50 mL each, D-1 to D-13). D-5 (60 mg) was purified using preparative TLC with toluene/hexane (20:80 v/v) yielding 6 (5 mg, Rf = 0.7) and 7 (2 mg, Rf = 0.75). For compounds 1, 2, 5–7, the purity (> 99%) was determined by HPLC analysis us- ing a diode-array detector (monitoring at λ = 254 nm) and two different chromatographic conditions (C8 and C18 stationary phases). Melting points of compounds 3 and 4 were determined and were in accordance with literature values. Fig. 1 Structures of compounds isolated from Peperomia obtusifolia. 621 da Silva Mota J et al.

HPLC and specific rotation analysis Analytical and semipreparative HPLC separations were per- formed using stainless-steel Phenomenex Luna® columns (250 × 4.6 mm I.D., 5 µm C8 and C18; 250 × 21.2 mm I.D., 10 µm; C18 and Pheny-hexyl; Phenomenex). Methanol was obtained from J.T. Baker. HPLC separations were carried out using a Varian Prepstar SD-1 equipped with a Rheodyne (Cotati) injector with a 2 mL sample loop and a Varian ProStar 320 UV‑Vis detector. Spe- cific rotations of the isolated compounds dissolved in chloroform were measured on a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter equipped with a Na lamp operating at 589 nm. Trypanocidal assay [7] An in vitro assay was performed measuring the proliferation of Y- strain epimastigotes growing in axenic culture. The samples to be tested were stored as 1 mg/mL stock solutions in dimethyl sulfox- ide (DMSO) and were serially diluted in LIT medium before use. The crude extracts, fractions and pure compounds were tested at 0.4, 1.2, 3.7, 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 µg/mL, in triplicate, using 1 × 105 epimastigotes/well. The number of remaining viable pro- tozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber fol- lowing incubation at 28°C for 72 h with the test samples. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and statistical data were determined with the probit analysis method using GW-BA- SIC 2.33 (Microsoft Software, 1987). The positive control benzni- dazole (> 99% of purity by HPLC) was obtained from Rochagan® tablets (Roche Brazil). Cytotoxicity assay The unspecific cytotoxic activity was determined according to the method of Mosmann, with minimal modifications [8]. Briefly, Balb/c isogenic mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 3 mL of sodium thioglycolate 3%. The animals were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber 3 days after inoculation. The peritoneal macrophages were extracted by injecting phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) followed by slight massage and suction using a syringe. The cells were transferred to a sterile tube in an ice bath and cellular suspension was prepared after centrifugation. The sediment cells were resus- pended in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ mL of streptomycin, 100 U/mL of penicillin and 5 × 10−2 M of β mercaptoethanol at density of 5 × 106 cells/mL (stock suspen- sion). In a 96-wells microtiter tray, 100 µL of cells from the stock suspension and 100 µL of test solutions dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium (final concentrations: 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 µg/ mL), were added. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C and 7.5% CO2, 100 µL of an MTT solution (2.5 mg/mL) were added to each well and incubated for 3 h under the same conditions. The optical density (590 nm) of the formazan crystals dissolved in 2-propa- nol was measured and compared with the negative control (only RPMI). The positive control for the trypanocidal assay (benznida- zole) was also evaluated. All treatments were performed in trip- licate and the IC50 values (with 95% confidence intervals), were determined by linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Software). Results and Discussion ! In this work, we assessed the anti-trypanosomal activity of crude extracts from the leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia, and their fractions obtained by liquid-liquid partition against the epi- mastigote forms of the Trypanosoma cruzi Y-strain. The crude ethanol extract from the leaves of P. obtusifolia showed significant trypanocidal activity (IC50 of 4.3 µg/mL) when com- pared to the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 2.7 µg/mL) (l \" Table 1). Thus, this extract was fractionated and all fractions EL-H, EL-HE, EL-E and EL-MH (IC50 of 3.9, 0.2, 5.6 and 7.7 µg/mL, respectively) were also active, with EL‑HE being the most active with an IC50 of 0.2 µg/mL. The crude ethanol extract from the stems of P. obtusifolia showed lower activity than EL (IC50 of 23.2 µg/mL), nevertheless it was partitioned as well. All fractions were tested and the hexane (ES‑H) and ethyl acetate (ES‑E) frac- tions were the most active with IC50 values of 2.8 and 7.2 µg/mL, respectively. Chemical investigations of the active fractions led to seven (1 – 7, l \" Fig. 1) known compounds: the chromanes 3,4-dihydro-5-hy- droxy-2,7-dimethyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl-1′, 3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (1) [9], pe- perobtusin A (6) [6] and clusifoliol (7) [6], [10]; the furofuran lig- nans 2-episesalatin (3) [11] and sesartemin (4) [12]; and the flavone C-diglycosides isoswertisin-4′-methyl-ether-2′′α-L-rham- noside (2) and isoswertisin-2′′α-L-rhamnoside (5) [13,14]. The structures of 1 – 7 were confirmed by IR, MS, 1H-, 13C‑NMR and 2D NMR spectral data, which were in agreement with the re- ported data for the respective compounds. Compounds 1, 6 and 7 had an optical activity [α]D 25: 0° (c. 1.0, CHCl3) suggesting a racemic mixture in the molecules bearing a chiral center at C-2. These results are in accordance with the data Table 1 In vitro trypanocidal activity of extracts and fractions from Peperomia obtusifolia (Piperaceae) against epimastigote forms of Trypanosama cruzi Y- straina.

This is the first report of the isolation of compound 1 from P. obtusifolia. It had previously been re- ported from Peperomia amplexicaulis [9]. The trypanocidal activity of the isolated compounds was deter- mined using benznidazole as the positive control (IC50 of 10.4 µM, l \" Table 2). The chromanes 1, 6 and 7 showed better try- panocidal activity, with IC50 values of 27.0, 3.1 and 47.5 µM re- spectively, than the lignans and glycosylflavones isolated. The po- tent trypanocidal activity observed for these compounds bearing a benzopyran nucleus substituted with isoprenyl moieties sup- ports our recent report which showed the trypanocidal activity of chromenes isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. adun- cum and semisynthetic derivatives [7]. Even though the furofuran lignans 2-episesalatin (3) and sesarte- min (4) had been isolated from the most active fraction EL‑HE (IC50 of 0.2 µg/mL, l \" Table 1) they showed weak activity, indicat- ing loss of the trypanocidal activity during fractionation. The fla- vone C-diglycosides 2 and 5 isolated from the leaves of P. obtusifo- lia did not display any trypanocidal activity (l \" Table 2). As ob- served for the inactive lignans 3 and 4, the further chromato- graphic fractionation of the active EL‑MH fraction (IC50 of 7.7 µg/mL) resulted in the isolation of inactive compounds. De- spite the negative results obtained for the flavone C-diglycosides 2 and 5 as well as for lignans 3 and 4 in the trypanocidal assay, further studies of EL‑HE and EL‑MH could be promising for the search of new trypanocidal compounds. The most active compounds 1 and 6 were also evaluated for their unspecific cytotoxicity in mammalian cells (murine peritoneal macrophages), and the obtained values indicated that chromanes were not toxic at the level of their trypanocidal activity (IC50 of 405.0 and 402.1 µM, l \" Table 2). Nevertheless, the cytotoxic activ- ity of 1 and 6 was higher than that of benznidazole (IC50 of 1138.0 µM, l \" Table 2), which was included in order to establish a comparison with the only drug available for the treatment of Chagasʼ disease. As selectivity is a relevant characteristic for de- fining lead molecules, the cytotoxicities were compared to the antiparasitic activities by calculating the SI (selectivity index) [16]. The SI values for 1, 6 and benznidazole were 14.9, 130.4 and 109, respectively, suggesting that 1 and particularly 6 have good selectivity for T. cruzi epimastigotes when compared with benznidazole. In conclusion, the present investigation revealed that the bioas- say-guided fractionation of extracts from the leaves and stems of P. obtusifolia led to the isolation of prenylated benzopyrans with potent anti-trypanosomal activity and a good selectivity in- dex when assayed in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that Piperaceae species are an important source of new trypano- cidal compounds. More extensive and detailed studies on the try- panocidal activity of natural chromanes as well as chromane de- rivatives should be undertaken in order to provide an under- standing of structural requirements for biological activity.

Introduction Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells that may affect almost any tissue of the body. Lung, colorectal and stomach cancer are among the most common in the world for both men and women. According to the World Health Organization cancer is responsible for 12% of the world’s mortality [1]. Plants have a long history of use in treatment of cancer and they have provided some of the currently used effective anticancer agents such as vinblastine, vincristine, etoposide, teniposide, and *Corresponding author.

The analysis of the sources of new and approved drugs for the treatment of cancer shows that 60% of these drugs were shown to be of natural origin, being natural compounds or derivatives thereof [3]. In vitro model system with human cells is increasingly used to investigate mechanism of chemical-induced toxicity and for toxicity screening of new drug families. Among the chemical entities assayed against cancer cell lines, acridone alkaloids have been a target of study by researchers. The acridone alkaloids are known to have several bioactivities, including antimalarial activity [4–6], antiviral [7,8], and cytotoxicity activity [9–11]. In this article, the isolation of 11 acridone alkaloids and three N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. and their in vitro cytotoxicity activity on several cancer cell lines are described. 2. Results and discussion The acridone alkaloids and N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives were isolated from the methanol extract of the stem and fresh fruits of Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr., respectively, and were identified on the basis of spectroscopic methods and comparison of literature data as: glycocitrine-IV (1) [12], 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy- 10-methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one (2) [13] and 1,3,5-trihydroxy- 2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone (3) [5], citbrasine (4) and citrusinine-II (5) [14], citrusinine-I (6) [15], 5-dihydroxyacronycine (7) [16], pyrano- foline (8) [17], dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl-2H-pyrano[2,3-a] acridin-12(7H)-one (9), 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxy-propan-2-yl)-11-meth- oxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-b]acridin-5(10H)-one (10) [13] and bis-5-hydroxyacronycine (11) [18], N-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (12), N-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethyl-4-acethyl-octa-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (13), and severine acetate (14) [19]. Swinglea is native to the Phillipine Islands but was introduced into Brazil where it grows well. Swinglea belongs to the Aurantioideae subfamily [20], and it is known to contain N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives and protolimonoids [19]. In the Aurantioideae, the relatively small representation of quinolones contrasts with a preferential accumulation of coumarins, acridones, amides, and flavonoids [21]. Thus, the range of compounds that were isolated from Swinglea reinforces its position as a member of the Aurantioideae. Natural and synthetic acridones represent important antitumor drugs. A character- istic example is the natural acridone acronycine (15), which posses an IC50 in leukemia cells in the order of 25 mM [22]. The structure–activity relationships (SAR) of a series of naturally occurring acridones have been studied to determine the effects of these compounds on the inhibition of cell growth and macromolecular biosynthesis of human promyelocytic leukemia cells [23]. Among 50 alkaloids tested, glyfoline (16) was found to be the most active compound (IC50 1.1 mM) and 21 alkaloids were found to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 mM), as compounds 6 (IC50 8.6 mM), 7 (IC50 8.8 mM), and 8 (IC50 7.1 mM). Further studies of glyfoline congeners by [24] revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the 1-hydroxy and the peri-carbonyl function of the 1-hydroxy-9-acridone nucleus was an important determinant for their cytotoxicity. Other 15 acridones were examined as inducers of HL-60 cell differentiation. These cells were differentiated into mature monocyte/macrophage by 48 P. A. C. Braga et al. Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013 atalaphyllidine (17), atalaphyllinine (18), and des-N-methylnoracronycine (19). The activities of NBT reduction (on a minimum of 200 cells), nonspecific esterase, and phagocytosis, were induced by 2.5 mM of 17–19. After a 4-day treatment, 17–19 at 10 mM inhibited clonal proliferation of HL-60 cells by 28, 96, and 63%, respectively. The SAR from the results revealed again that hydroxyl group at C-1 had an important role, as well as a prenyl group at C-2 of the tetracyclic acridones [9]. The same 15 acridones were examined for their antiproliferative effect on monolayers and suspension of several types of cancer cell lines, human lung carcinoma (A-549), melanin pigment- producing mouse melanoma (B-16 melanoma 4A5), T-cell leukemia (CCRF-HSB-2), gastric cancer cell, and lymph-node metastasized (TGBC11TKB) [10]. As a result, atalaphyllidine (17), atalaphyllinine (18), des-N-methylnoracronycine (19), and 5-hydroxy-N-methylseverifoline (20) showed potent antiproliferative activity against tumor cell lines. The SAR established from the results revealed that a secondary amine, hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-5, and a prenyl group at C-2 played an important role for antiproliferative activities of the tetracyclic acridones [23].

This stimulated us to test these alkaloids on other types of cancer cell lines, the human lung carcinoma cell line, Cytotoxicity activity of derivatives from S. glutinosa (Bl.)

The sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay was used to test cytotoxicity against all cell lines and vinblastine sulfate (Sigma) was used as a positive control. The IC50 values of antitumor activity of the eleven acridone alkaloids and three N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives on COR-L23, MCF7, C-32, and MRC-5 are summarized in table 1. Unfortunately, in spite of their promising structural features, none of the acridone tested exhibited high level of cytotoxicity, with IC50 values ranging from 47.5 to 93.3 mM. In previous studies, di- and monoprenylate acridones were shown to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 mM) on human leukemic HL-60 cell. Examples are 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,4-bis(3-methyl- but-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone; with IC50 13.7 mM, and 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-(3-methyl- but-2-enyl)-5-methoxyl-10-methyl-9-acridone with (IC50 10.1 mM) [10]. However, acridone congeners 1–3 did not show significant activity on cancer cell lines COR- L23 (IC50: 14100, 2 66.1, 3 69.1 mM), MCF7 (IC50: 14100, 2 70.4, 34100 mM) and C32 (IC50: 14100, 2 70.1, 3 86.9 mM). In addition, what was particularly surprising in our study was the lack of appreciable activity for compounds 6–8 (COR-L23, IC50: 64100, 7 69.9, 84100 mM; MCF7, IC50: 64100, 7 77.6, 84100 mM, and C32, IC50: 64100, 7 83.9, 84100 mM) since they were found to be more active than acronycine on human leukemic HL-60 cells [10]. Examination of the preceding compilation and our data reveal some impediments to develop a qualitative understanding of structure–activity. Different investigators seldom utilize the same cancer cell lines and interspecific differences in the response of the test cells can easily mask any meaningful observation of SARs. The present results obtained from acridone alkaloids on cancer cell lines COR-L23, MCF7 and C-32 are reported here for the first time. Among the enormous variety of alkaloids Table 1.

Plant material Leaves, stem, and root bark were collected in Campinas (SP), Brazil, at Instituto Agronoˆ mico de Campinas, and dried in the shade. The plant was identified by Prof. Dr Maira Ineˆ s Salgado. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of Universidade Federal de Sa˜ o Carlos (HUFSCar) number 7110 at Departamento de Botaˆ nica of Universidade Federal de Sa˜ o Carlos. 3.3. Isolation of compounds 3.3.1. Alkaloids. The parts of the plant were extracted separately with n-hexane at room temperature for 3 days, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure at 40C, this procedure was done three times to yield the hexane crude extract. The residue was extracted as the same way using MeOH to yield the n-hexane and methanol crude extract. The MeOH crude extract 60 g was fractioned by VCC over 1 kg of silica gel 60 (70–239 mesh, Merck) eluting with 1.5 L of the solvents: C6H14 100% (fraction 1), CH2Cl2 100% (fraction 2), CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 3 : 1 (fraction 3); CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 2 : 1 (fraction 4); CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 1 : 1 (fraction 4) and CH3OH 100% (fraction 5). Fractions 2 and 3 were combined after analyses with TLC. The result was chromatographed on silica gel eluted with CH2Cl2; the polarity was increased by addition of 5, 10, 13, 18, 20, and 25% of MeOH in a gradient system to yield 15 fractions. Lupeol was crystallized from the fractions 1–3. The fraction 5 was rechromatographed on Si gel eluted with n-hexane–acetone 1 : 3 and gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 60 4 cm2; MeOH) yield alkaloids 1 (3.5 mg), 2 (16.3 mg), 3 (30.4 mg), 4 (11.2 mg), 7 (9.8 mg), 8 (13.4 mg), and 11 (5.4 mg). Further purification of fraction 9 using gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 45 3 cm2; MeOH) followed by using of HPLC (column SHODEX ASAHIPAK GS-310 2G; flow rate at 3.0 mL min1; UV detection at 254 and 365 nm; MEOH as eluted) yield compounds 3 (7.3 mg), 5 (13.5 mg), and 6 (11.2 mg). Fraction 10 after rechromatographed on gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 30 3 cm2; MeOH) afforded compound 9 (4.3 mg) and 10 (5.2 mg). 52 P. A. C. Braga et al. Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013 3.3.2. N-phenylethyl-benzamide compounds. The sliced fresh fruits were stirred with MeOH at room temperature for 3 days. The extract was evaporated under vacuum and residue partitioned into CH2Cl2-, EtOAc- and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. Fractions CH2Cl2 and EtOAc were combined, solvent removed and the residue (26 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, elution with a hexane–CH2Cl2–EtOAc–MeOH gradient afforded 09 fractions. Fraction 2 was twice rechromatographed (silica gel, hexane– CH2Cl2 4 : 1; then silica gel, hexane–Me2CO 3 : 1) to give 12 and a fraction containing 13 and 14. The latter was rechromatographed as above, elution with hexane–EtOAc 7 : 1 yielded a mixture of 13 and 14. The latter was rechromatographed as described before, elution with hexane–EtOAc 7 : 1 and then by HPLC (column SHODEX ASAHIPAK GS-310 2G; flow rate at 3.0 mL min1; UV detection at 254 and 365 nm; eluted with CH2Cl2) affording compounds 13 (8 mg) and 14 (9 mg). 3.4. In vitro biological assays 3.4.1. Cell lines. Cancer cell lines used in this work were human lung carcinoma cell line, COR-L23, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7, the human melanoma cell line, C32 and normal human fetal lung cell line, MRC-5. The cells COR-L23, MCF7 and C32 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplement with 10% heated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% of 2 Mm L-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/ streptomycin. MRC-5 were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified minimum essential medium) with 10% FBS, 1% of 2 Mm L-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/ streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37C in a 5% CO2. According to their growth profiles, the follow densities of each cell were used: 1 103, 3 103, 3 103, and 2 103 cell/well for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5, respectively. 3.4.2. Preparation of cell suspension for assay. The human cell lines were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The PBS was decanted and cells detached with 2.5 mL of trypsin (Sigma) and PBS was added to a volume of 10 mL. The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation (37C, 115 r.p.m. and 5 min) was ressuspended in 10 mL of suitable medium to make a cell suspension. The cell density was counted by triplan exclusion in a hemocytometer and then diluted with medium to give the previously determined optimal densities for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5. The cell suspension (100 mL) from each cell were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37C to allow the attachment. After 24 h the cells were treated with the pure compounds solutions. Each pure compounds was initially dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) and after they were diluted in medium to produce four concentrations of 50, 5, 0.5, and 0.05 mg mL1. 3.4.3. Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay. The antiproliferative SRB assay was performed to assess growth inhibition by a colorimetric assay that estimates cell number indirectly by staining total cellular protein with the dye SRB [27]. Cells were fixed by layering 100 mL of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA, Aldrich Chemical) on top of grown medium. Cells were incubated at 4C for 1 h, after which plates were washed five times with water, the excess water drained off, and the plates left to dry in air at room temperature. SRB stain (50 mL; 0.4 in 1% acetic acid) (Sigma) was added to each well and left in contact with the cells for 30 min, after which they were washed with solution Cytotoxicity activity of derivatives from S. glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. 53 Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013 of 1% acetic acid and rinsed four times until only dye adhering to the cells was left. The plates were dried at room temperature and 100 mL of 10 mM Tris base pH 10.5 (Sigma) were added to each well to solubilize the dye. The plates were shaken gently for 2 min, and the absorbance of each well was read on a SLT 340 ATTC plate reader (SLT Labinstrument, Australia) at 492 nm. Cell survival was measured as the percentage absorbance compared to the control (nontreated cells). The IC50 values were calculated from the PRISM program obtained by plotting the percentage of survival versus the concentration and interpolated by cubic spine.

NFB regulates the expression of several genes involved in carcinogenesis. These include anti-apoptotic, cytokines and cell cycle-regulatory genes. It is well established that the transcriptional factor NFB is deregulated in many forms of cancer. Thus, agents that can suppress NFB activation have the potential of suppressing carcinogenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from Alchornea glandulosa (Euphorbiaceae) and eight esters were synthesised. These compounds were evaluated against TNF--induced NFB activation with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Gallates with IC50 values in a range of 10–56 mM mediated inhibitory activity higher than gallic acid (IC50 76.0 4.9 mM). In addition to inhibiting NFB activation, gallic acid mediated a modest cytotoxic effect, and some of the gallates affected cell viability at the tested concentrations. Based on these results, suppression of NFB activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis.

Email: pezzuto@hawaii.edu ISSN 1478–6419 print/ISSN 1029–2349 online 2010 Taylor & Francis DOI: 10.1080/14786410903335232 http://www.informaworld.com Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014 Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid), a secondary metabolite accumulates in nearly all plants, either in free form or part of tannins, is known to possess antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic properties (Aruoma, Murcia, Butler, & Halliwell, 1993; Fiuza et al., 2004; Kratz et al., 2008; Kroes, van den Berg, van Ufford, van Dijk, & Labadie, 1992; Kubo, Fujita, K. Nihei & A. Nihei, 2004). It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as salts and esters. Some ointments used to treat psoriasis and external hemorrhoids contain gallic acid (Garcı´a de Hombre & Pe´ rez Pen˜ ate, 2006; Hatton, 2000). Gallic acid has two major functional groups, hydroxyls and a carboxylic acid, which can yield numerous esters and salt derivatives. Some galloyl compounds are used as antioxidants in food and can exhibit important roles in prevention of inflammatory and atherosclerosis responses by blocking activation of NFB (Murase et al., 1999). NFB consists of homo and heterodimeric protein complexes acting as a transcription factor, and is found in many animal cell types. It is involved in regulation of immune response and inflammation, cell lineage development, cell apoptosis, cell-cycle progression and oncogenesis due to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidised LDL and microbial antigens, and has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, cIAP, survivin, TRAF, COX-2, MMP-9, iNOS and cell cycle-regulatory components, whose products are involved in tumourigenesis (Aggarwal, Sethi, Nair, & Ichikawa, 2006; Chen, Castranova, & Shi, 2001; Melisi & Chiao, 2007; Thanos & Maniatis, 1995). Most carcinogens, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, or tumour promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, H2O2, have been shown to activate NFB, and resulting tumours have misregulated NFB activity (Baldwin, 2001). It is now well established that aberrant regulation of NFB, and the signalling pathways that control its activity, are involved in cancer development and progression, as well as in drug resistance, especially during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Inoue, Gohda, Akiyama, & Semba, 2007). Blocking NFB can cause tumour cells to stop proliferating, undergo apoptosis, or to become more sensitive to the action of antitumour agents (Frydrych & Mlejnek, 2008; Yamamoto & Gaynor, 2001). Thus, agents that can suppress NFB activation have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis or tumourigenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from Alchornea glandulosa Poepp and Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), and eight semi-synthetic esters were prepared. All the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity as well as potential to inhibit TNF--induced NFB activation with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Methanol, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and p-dioxane were of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade (JT Baker). Column chromatography was carried out over silica gel (0.06–0.20 mm, Acros Organics). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). Preparative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system and a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional NMR experiments were Natural Product Research 1759 Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014 recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvent (Aldrich). Alkyl alcohols and DCC were purchased from Aldrich. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and sulphorho- damine B (SRB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), antibiotic–antimycotic, hygro- mycin B, and MEM sodium pyruvate were purchased from Invitrogen Co. (Carlsbad, CA). Reporter Lysis Buffer, Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison). Tumour Necrosis Factor- (TNF-) was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Alcohol was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). 2.2. Isolation of gallic acid The leaves of A. glandulosa were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac¸ u, Sa˜ o Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen (SP319257) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜ o Paulo-SP, Brazil). The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L 3) at room temperature and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrup residue, which was diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and then successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the partition phases yielded 2.5 g and 0.8 g, respectively. The part of EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford 11 fractions (A1–A11). Fraction A2 (730 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : HOAc (7.5 : 92 : 0.5), UV detection at 265 nm; flow rate 15 mL min1] to give compound 1 (335 mg). Compound 1 was identified as gallic acid based on analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR data, as well as by comparison with authentic material in our laboratory (Figure 1).

Molecular structures of gallic acid (1) and semi-synthetic esters (2–9). 1760 M.C.C. Morais et al. Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014 2.3. Synthesis of esters 2–9 After being cooled at 5C, the mixture of gallic acid (0.2 mmol) and alcohol (20 mmol) in p-dioxane (6.0 mL) was added to a solution of N,N0-dicyclohexylcar- bodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane (3.0 mL). The solution was stirred for 48 h, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned three times with EtOAc and then filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (three times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (three times), water (two times), dried over MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column using an isocratic system of CHCl3–MeOH (98 : 2) to give gallate esters 2–8. Structures of the semi- synthetic esters, methyl gallate (2), ethyl gallate (3), n-propyl gallate (4), isopropyl gallate (5), n-butyl gallate (6), isobutyl gallate (7), n-pentyl gallate (8) and 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid (9), were established by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis (Figure 1). For synthesis of ester 9, gallic acid (20 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (5.0 mL) and anhydride acetic (5.0 mL) under hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, carried to dryness under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography with a mixture of CHCl3–MeOH (85 : 15) to give a product (9). The NMR spectroscopic data of 9 were compatible with 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid. 2.4. NFjB luciferase assay NFB inhibition assay was conducted using a luciferase reporter gene bioassay as previously described (Homhual et al., 2006). Human embryonic kidney cells (293/ NFB-Luc) were used to monitor alteration of the NFB pathway. This cell line is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct regulated by the NFB response element. Transcription factor can bind to the response element when stimulated by TNF-, allowing transcription of the luciferase gene. Luciferase reacts with substrate, emitting light that was detected using a luminometer. Cells were seeded (105 cells mL1) on sterile white walled 96-well plates and grown to approximately 80% confluence by incubating for 48 h. Gallic acid and alkyl gallates were tested at 20 mg mL1 following 1 : 3 serial dilutions. After treatment with tested compounds for 10 min, cells were incubated for an additional 6 h with or without TNF- (5 ng mL1). The cells were gently washed with PBS and kept at 80C with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corporation). The luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay system from Promega following manufacturer instructions. Luciferase activity was monitored (LUMIstar Galaxy BMG), dose-response curves were constructed, and results were expressed as IC50 values (i.e. concentration required to inhibit TNF- induced NFB activity by 50%). 2.5. Cytotoxicity assay Cytotoxicity was determined by the method of Skehan et al. (1990). The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and stained for 30 min with 0.4% (w/v) sulphorho- damine B (SRB) prepared in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM Tris base Natural Product Research 1761 Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014 [tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader. 2.6. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences between means were located using Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Differences between means at the 5% (p 5 0.05) level were considered significant. The data are expressed as means standard error. 3. Results and discussion Herein we report cytotoxic properties and suppression of TNF- induced NFB activation of gallic acid (1) and eight esters (2–9) determined with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Table 1 shows the concentrations of gallates 1–9 required to inhibit NFB-induced activation in 50% (IC50). N-Tosyl- L-phenylalaninyl-chlormethylketone (TPCK) was adopted as positive control, exhibiting 98.5% 0.5% NFB inhibition at 30 mM, with an IC50 value of about 5 mM. At the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg mL1), gallic acid mediated a moderate cytotoxic effect (52.9% 3.5% survival), but none of the gallate esters significantly affected cell viability. The most cytotoxic compound evaluated was 6, with 48.9% 3.3% cell survival. Among inhibitors of NFB, salicylates, aspirin (Kopp & Ghosh, 1994), apigenin and curcumin (Gerritsen et al., 1995; Singh & Aggarwal, 1996) were reported to suppress activation of NFB by preventing the degradation of the NFB inhibitor (IB), and therefore NFB was retained in the cytosol. The serine protease inhibitor TPCK can cause a complete block to NFB activation. TPCK inhibits NFB subunits processing and IB degradation (Mellitis, Hay, & Goodbourn, 1993). It has also been demonstrated that TPCK inhibits DNA replication by G0–G1 growth arrest and thus promotes apoptosis by other cytotoxic stimuli (Kirillova, Chaisson, & Fausto, 1999). Table 1.

Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014 The present study provides evidence that some gallates can act as inhibitors of NFB. Methyl gallate (2) demonstrated the greatest activity. The inhibitory actions of gallates do not appear to result from non-specific cellular toxicity but rather are specific for NFB-dependent gene transcription. In another study, it has been demonstrated that gallates can inhibit TNF--induced nuclear translocation of NFB by way of a mechanism independent of IB degradation (Murase et al., 1999). More recently, prevention of atherosclerosis, cancer, anti-plasmodial and antioxidant activity of a group of galloyl compounds was described, as well as structure-activity relationships yielding cytotoxic properties (Fiuza et al., 2004; Jagan, Ramakrishnan, Anandakumar, Kamaraj, & Devaki, 2008; Locatelli et al., 2008; Murase et al., 1999; Na et al., 2006; Petroˆ nio et al., 2007; Saxena et al., 2008). Based on these encouraging intracellular responses, we suggest suppression of NFB activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis, and further investigations related to the actions of gallates, especially in NFB signaling pathway and in vivo models, may provide new insights into the cancer chemopreventive ability.

Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene isolated from the ethanolic leaf extract of C.sylvestris. The aim of the study was to assess the capacity of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris leaves and caseargrewiin F to protect DNA and verify if both the compounds cause some DNA damage, using the micronu- cleus (MN) test and comet assay in mice. Balb-C mice were treated with the extract [3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)] and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 14 days. On day 15, DNA damage was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of cyclophosphamide (CP) (i.p.) at 50 mg/kg b.w. after the MN test and comet assay were performed. A protective effect of ethanolic extract was observed in MN test (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg b.w.) and the comet assay (3.13 and 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F showed protective effect at 0.63, 1.3 and 2.5 mg/kg b.w. only in comet assay. We also tested the ability of compounds of C.sylvestris to induce MN and to increase the comet assay tail moment. The experimental design was similar to the DNA protection assay except that in test groups we omitted the CP challenge. We observed increased damage at 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F at 3.18 mg/kg b.w. in both the MN test and comet assay. We conclude that ethanolic extract of C. sylvestris and case- argrewiin F can protect cells against DNA damage induced by CP at low concentrations, but at high concentrations these compounds also induce DNA damage. Introduction Medicinal herbs have long been used in medical treatment and are still the sole remedy against several diseases in many parts of the world (1). Also, many natural products present in fruits, beverages and vegetables may be regarded as protective or even anti-proliferation agents for several types of human cancer (2). Some Brazilian natural products, including those that are isolated from Casearia sylvestris, are used in folk medicine, despite their potential toxicity. C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) (3) is a tree widely distributed in Brazil, from Amapa´ in the north down to Rio Grande do Sul and it is found in a variety of ecosystems from the savannah-like the Cerrado to the tropical Atlantic Rain forest and the equatorial Amazon forest. Moreover, it has also been found in Mexico and the Antilles (4). Casearia sylvestris is commonly known as ‘guacxatonga’ and used widely for its anti-inﬂammatory and anti-ulcerative activities (4–6) as well as its cytotoxic activity against malignant tumour cells (7). In addition, the bark of C.sylvestris has been used against fever and for treatment of herpes virus and diarrhoea (8). Phytochemical investigations revealed that the major compounds isolated from C.sylvestris exhibited both cytotoxic and anti-fungal activities (7). Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene, found in plants of the Casearia genus, described as a colourless and amorphous solid (9). While caseargrewiin F was not shown to be cytotoxic to human epidermoid carcinoma in the mouth, it exhibited cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and human small cell lung cancer. In the present study, caseargrewiin F was isolated from the leaves of C.sylvestris. In order to complement the studies of biological activity of compounds isolated from C.sylvestris, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the ethanolic extract of leaves of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protect cells against DNA-induced damage or induce DNA damage by theirselves, using the micronucleus (MN) test and comet assay in Balb- C mice. Materials and methods Plant material and preparation of extract Leaves of C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) were collected at the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (Sa˜o Miguel Arcanjo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herbarium ‘Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann’ (Instituto Botaˆnico do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identiﬁed by Dr Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris (20.5 kg) were extracted with ethanol (ca. 200 litre) in a stainless steel extractor with solvent re-circulation for ca. 24 h at 40C. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotaevaporator) and dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield 1.5 kg of dry residue. Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The identiﬁcation of compounds in ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was carried out in Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, by Andre Gonzaga dos Santos. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The sample was dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure, dissolved in 4.0 ml of methanol and ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a high performance liquid chroma- tography (HPLC) vial. The reference standard used in this work—caseargrewiin F and casearin U—was puriﬁed and identiﬁed in the laboratories of Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, Araraquara, Brazil; for details see Santos et al. (10). The standard solutions were prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of caseargrewiin F into a volumetric ﬂask. After diluting with methanol, the standard solutions (0.0079, 0.0159, 0.0635, 0.2540 e 0.5080 mg/ml) were ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a HPLC vial before injections. Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Varian ProStar system (comprising a model 240 pump, a 410 autosampler and a 330 photodiode array detector), with control and data handling managed by Star Chromatography software. Analysis was conducted using a Phenom- enex Gemini C-18 column (250 4.6 mm, 5 lm) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile: methanol: water (from 44:22:34 to 47:53:00, v/v/v, in 42 min) and acetonitrile: methanol (53:47, v/v, in 5 min); ﬂow rate 0.8 ml/min; detection range 210–400 nm; injection volume 20 ll. Analysis was realized in triplicate. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis A 5.0 mg of dried extract was submitted to SPE (2 1 cm) from silica gel (60– 200 lm; Merck): activated charcoal (Synth) (1:1, w/w) eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate (95:05, v/v, 5.0 ml). The sample was dried and diluted in hexane to afford 1.0 mg/ml solution. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chromatograph with ﬂame ionization detector using a DB-5 column (30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 lm). The carrier gas was He at a ﬂow rate of 1.33 ml/min, split mode with ratio of 1:20 and injection volume of 1 ll. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 250C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 60C, with an increase of 3C/min, to 240C. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis analysis was conducted using the same system and conditions interfaced to a mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an ion trap detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The compounds were identiﬁed by their retention indexes, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes (11) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7.0 library and of the literature (11). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis Dried extract was diluted in CDCl3 (50.0 mg/ml) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA 500 11.4 T instrument with CHCl3 as internal standard. Ethanolic extract emulsions The ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was dissolved in Tween 20 (20%). Balb-C male mice were treated with 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. The concentrations of the test were chosen based on the high solubility of the ethanolic extract in the Tween 20 (20%). Puriﬁcation and structure determination of caseargrewiin F Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris were extracted by steeping in ethanol. The dried extract obtained was separated by SPE on silica gel: activated charcoal and fraction SPE2 was separated further by normal-phase low-pressure column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. Fractions CC15-19 were puriﬁed by preparative reversed-phase (C18) HPLC to yield caseargrewiin F (850.0 mg). The structure of the compound was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. For details see Santos et al. (10). The chromatographic purity of the caseargrewiin F in the assays used was 98.6% (HPLC-UV detected at 235 nm). Caseargrewiin F emulsions Caseargrewiin F (Figure 1) was emulsiﬁed in 6% Tween 80 for both assays in mice. The Balb-C male mice were treated with 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg of caseargrewiin F per kg body weight (b.w.). These concentrations were based on ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris in which doses of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. were used; since caseargrewiin F represents 4% of the ethanolic extract, we selected doses that are 4% of the ethanolic extract doses. Animals Six-week-old Balb-C male mice were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (22 2C) and humidity (55 10% room humidity), in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized for 1 week, during which they had free access to a commercial diet (Purina) and water. The study was conduced with approval of Brazilian Ethics Commitee to Experimentation Animals (process CEP/FCF/CAr n 01/2006). Mutagenic chemical–Positive control Cyclophosphamide (CP, Sigma–Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, Lot. No. 036K1225, purity 99%) was used as mutagenic agent in experiments. CP was diluted in 0.9% NaCl just before use and the animals were exposed to the chemical by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg b.w. in 0.3 ml. Mutagenicity—MN test Experimental design The assays were performed using eight animals/group. Group 1 (negative control) mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection of 0.3 ml. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and was treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%), 0.6 ml by gavage, for 2 weeks and on day 15 the mice were injected i.p. with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl. Groups 4–9 were treated for 2 weeks by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with various concentrations of ethanolic extract (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) or caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.). These groups also received treatment with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl by i.p on day 15. Bone marrow from each animal was collected 24 h after the last administration (12). The bone marrow MN test was carried out as described by Schmid (13). All slides were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and coded to avoid observer bias. For each experimental point, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were scored to determine the percentages of micronucleated PCE. The ratio of PCEs to normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) (PCEs/NCEs) was determined in 200 cells. Genotoxicity—comet assay For the comet assay, the experimental design was the same as for the MN test in mice. Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized capillary vials and kept on ice until use. The alkaline version of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) was performed as described by Singh (14). Brieﬂy, 20 ll of blood was taken, homogenized with low-melting point agarose, spread on microscope slide pre-coated with normal melting point agarose and covered with a coverslip. After 5 min at 4C, the coverslip was removed from slides and they were immersed in cold lysing solution (2.4 M NaCl; 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); 10 mM Tris, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 1% Triton-X, pH 10) for 24 h. After lysis, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber, covered with electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH plus 1 mM EDTA, pH .13) and left for 20 min for the DNA to unwind. The electrophoresis was run for 20 min (25 V and 300 mA), after which the slides were submerged for 15 min in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) and ﬁxed in 96% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were prepared in duplicate with ethidium bromide and 50 cells were screened per sample in a ﬂuorescent microscope (ZEISS, Germany) equipped with an excitation ﬁlter of 515–560 nm, a barrier ﬁlter of 590 nm and a 40 objective. The level of Fig. 1. Chemical structure of caseargrewiin F. A. M. de Oliveira et al. 502 DNA damage was assessed by an image analysis system (TriTek CometScore 1.5, 2006) and the percentage of DNA in tail was obtained. Antimutagenicity—MN test Experimental design In Group 1 (negative control), mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and were treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with 0.6 ml Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%) by gavage, for 2 weeks, and on day 15 received CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.); the aim of this group is to ensure that Tween has no inﬂuence in possible DNA protective effect. Groups 4–9 were treated by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with solutions of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 2 weeks and, on day 15, CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p) was administered. Bone marrow was taken 24 h of CP after the injection (12). The MN test was performed as described previously for the mutagenicity assays. Antigenotoxicity—comet assay The experimental design for the Comet assay was the same as for antimutagenicity MN test and the comet assay for antigenotoxicity was carried out as described for the genotoxicity assay. Recently, Collins et al. (15) described that when comet assay is performed in in vivo experiments low concentrations of genotoxic agents are unlikely to induce signiﬁcant cytotoxicity, they also afﬁrm that a low comet assay DNA damage would be a better indicator that cells are alive than common cytotoxicity tests. In this context, to the comet assay we did not performed cytotoxicity test once at low concentrations, the compounds were not genotoxic and consequently did not present cytotoxicity that could inﬂuence in antigenotoxicity assay. Statistical analysis For a statistical interpretation, results were analyzed with Sigma Stat 3.5, Systat, CA. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test data for normal distribution, in all assays performed in the study. Since the results did not a show normal distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. In mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays, the Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare DNA damage with the negative control. In the MN tests, the PCE/NCE ratio was evaluated with the Kruskal–Wallis test. In antimutagenicity/antigenotoxicity assays, Mann– Whitney U test was used to compare all groups tested with the Tween 20 (20%) plus CP group, to assess the decrease in DNA damage. To test whether any groups demonstrated signiﬁcant reduction in DNA damage to basal levels, those groups were also compared with negative control by the Mann–Whitney U test. Results Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The 1H NMR spectrum from extract showed signals with absorptions in d 1.98–2.09, 2.20–2.40, 3.43, 5.07–5.45, 6.25– 6.75, similar to those described for casearins and other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C.sylvestris (10,16–18). Both casearin U and caseargrewiin F were identiﬁed in the extract. However, casearin U was not assayed in the present study. Quantitative High performance liquid chromatography- diode array detector analysis demonstrated that the content of caseargrewiin F in the extract was 40.0 mg/g. Additionally, the chromatogram (Figure 2) presented 29 peaks with UV spectrum similar to observed for casearins and caseargrewiin F (kmax 5 231–236 nm). The results of chemical analysis suggest the presence of these clerodane diterpenes in the extract. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) for ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table I. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were observed at 50 and 75 mg/kg (both P , 0.01). The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that there was no cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris Table II shows the protective effect of the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. Since Tween 20 (20%) was used to dissolve the ethanolic extract, in the vehicle control this solution was administered before the CP to ensure that it has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect of the test group. Consequently, there is no difference between Tween 20 (20%) plus CP and positive control. When the protective effect was evaluated by the MN test, an antimuta- genic effect was observed in mice treated with 6.25 (P , 0.01) and 12.5 mg/kg (P , 0.05). However, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not reduce the DNA damage to the basal level. In the comet assay, the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 3.13 (P , 0.01), 6.25 (P , 0.01), 12.5 (P , 0.05) and 25 mg/kg (P , 0.05). Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—caseargrewiin F The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table III. Clastogenicity and primary damage were observed at 3.8 mg/kg b.w. of caseargrewiin F (both P , 0.05) Fig. 2. Results from HPLC-DAD analysis.

Casearia sylvestris protects DNA damage 503 in, respectively, the MN test and comet assay. The parameter used to assess genotoxicity by comet assay was % DNA in tail. The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that caseargrewiin F was not cytotoxic to mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of caseargrewiin F The antimutagenesis/antigenotoxicity assays were performed to determine if caseargrewiin F protects DNA from inducible damage (CP, 50 mg/kg b.w.). Table IV shows the protective effect of caseargrewiin F against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. In the positive control, water was administered before CP, in order to maintain the same conditions as in the test groups (gavage intake) while determining the DNA damage induced by the CP without protection. To verify that Tween 80 has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect in the test group, we administered the emulsifying solution before the CP. The negative control was used to check basal levels of DNA damage. The caseargrewiin F did not show a statistically signiﬁcant protective effect when assessed by the MN test. However, in the comet assay, it signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 0.63 (P , 0.01), 1.3 (P , 0.01) and 2.5 (P , 0.01) mg/kg b.w. Discussion Previously, natural products have been used in popular medicine to treat several diseases without any knowledge about how harmful these compounds may be to human health. Recently, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of these natural products (19–21). In the present study, distinct assays were performed to reveal whether the ethanolic extracts of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F were mutagenic and or genotoxic. The results presented here demonstrated that the extract was genotoxic and mutagenic at highest concentrations in comet assay and MN test (50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F was both mutagenic and Table I.

M. de Oliveira et al. 504 genotoxic at the highest dose of 3.8 mg/kg b.w. A similar result was obtained in a recent study that describes mutagenic and genotoxic activity at high concentrations of another clerodane diterpene assessed by the MN test and comet assay (22). Considering that comet assay detects genomic lesions that are susceptible to DNA repair while MN test reveals more drastically lesions in chromosome level (23), it is important to realize that the two highest concentrations of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and at the high concentration case- argreiin F induced unrepairable DNA damage. A mutagenic effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F could represent a potential antitumour property, as previous works on C.sylvestris demonstrated strong antitumour activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (17) and its casearins (clerodane diterpenes) exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against V-79 tumour cells (18). Interestingly, in the comet assay, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was more efﬁcient at preventing primary DNA damage at low concentrations (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). The molecules with non-mutagenic and/or antimutagenic properties could have antioxidant properties and, sometimes, may activate DNA repair pathways (24). They may act directly on the mutagenic process, by increasing the ﬁdelity in DNA replication (desmutagens) or by stimulating DNA damage error-free repair (bio-antimutagenesis) (25). Additionally, ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not presented a dose- dependent response in both comet assay and MN test, and this result can be affected by various associated factors such as dependence of the effect of the substance on dose, the complexity of the test organism and the inﬂuence of simultaneous metabolic routes and enzymatic pathways (26). Caseargrewiin F was not antimutagenic when assessed by the MN test, but showed an antigenotoxic dose-dependent re- sponse in the comet assay over the range of 0.63–2.5 mg/kg b.w. (Table IV). In accordance with the present work, previous study has demonstrated that essential oil of C.sylvestris has clastogenicity and anticlastogenicity in HTC cell line (27). Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were identiﬁed in the essential oil (28) whereas in the present study, sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes were identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract. Among 15 sesquiter- penes identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract, 13 were previous identiﬁed in essential oil (11,28). The mutagenic and genotoxic activity as well as the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris could be related to the sesquiterpenes. Additionally, there are recent studies that describe sesquiter- penes as chemopreventive (27,29). However, we cannot exclude the potential biological effects of the clerodane diterpenes since caseargrewiin F protected DNA from primary damage. Moreover, the use of mice instead of cell lines to assess protective effect of ethanolic extract could better verify absorption and metabolism of C.sylvestris in a complex organism. Recently, natural products have been described to protect DNA from damage and cause DNA damage (30,31) as observed in the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and case- argrewiin F. Similar results were obtained in earlier studies and described these products as Janus compounds, referring to the mytological Roman god Janus, who had two faces in the same: one looking forward and the other backward (32). Comet assay also revealed that C.sylvestris exhibited chemoprotective effects, but was not able to reduce the levels of DNA damage to negative controls values. Other studies suggested similar effects. Santos and Takahashi (33) demonstrated that seleno- methionine, a selenium-derived antioxidant compound, was both genotoxic and antigenotoxic and reduced the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, but not to values as low as the negative control. Cytotoxic events could lead to overestimation of the chemoprotective effects observed here. Thus, it is also important to consider that C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F did not exhibit cytotoxic effects alone neither in combination with the CP as observed in the PCE/NCE values. Likewise, the chemoprotective effects can be considered only in the concentrations that did not exhibit genotoxic effects, a recom- mendation of the publication of Zeiger (34). Thus, our results demonstrate that the beneﬁts of using ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F as DNA protective compounds could be respectively safe at doses ,50 mg/kg b.w. and 3.8 mg/kg b.w. We conclude that the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protects DNA against damage in low concentrations, which was carefully estimated by using MN test and comet assay. Keeping in mind that the same ethanolic extract and caseargrewiin F also can cause DNA damage in high concentrations.

This compound crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. There is one strong hydrogen bond, with OD OA = 2.6238 (12) AÊ and ODÐH OA = 171.1 (17) involving the COOH group, forming a cyclic dimer about a center of symmetry. The packing of the molecules is additionally stabilized by one CÐ H O [CD OA = 2.9820 (16) AÊ and CDÐH OA = 101.8 (10)] and two CÐH intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Comment The title carboxylic acid, (I), has been investigated because of its interesting inhibitory activity against adenine phospho- ribosyltransferase (APRT) from Leishmania tarentolae which is a member of the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) family. The PRTases are responsible for the salvage of purine, pyridine and pyrimidine nucleotides, as well as aromatic amino acids. Most organisms synthesize adenine nucleotides by both the de novo and the salvage pathways. In contrast, protozoan parasites are strict purine nucleotide auxotrophs because of the absence of a purine de novo biosynthetic pathway (Berens et al., 1995). Therefore, these microorgan- isms are absolutely dependent on scavenging pre-formed purine nucleotides from the host or the media (Ullman & Carter, 1997). To look for new potential anti-leishmania drugs, we used the APRT from L. tarentolae as a model system to investigate the inhibitory capacity of A. fusci¯orus extracts. The screening was performed using a spectrophotometric assay (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1980); the IC50 of pure compound (I) is 147 mM. In view of this interest, we have extracted the title compound, (I), and present here its crystal structure. Compound (I) crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The re®ned molecular structure, together with the atom-labeling scheme, are shown in Fig. 1 (Johnson, 1965). All the bond distances and angles are close to normal values (Allen et al., Received 3 July 2003 Accepted 22 September 2003 Online 30 September 2003 organic papers o1576 M. Silva et al. C16H20O5 Acta Cryst. (2003). E59, o1575±o1577 1983). The benzene ring C4±C9 in the central part of the molecule is very nearly planar, the maximum deviation of any of its atoms from the least-squares plane describing them being 0.0051 (8) AÊ , while the average deviation is 0.0030 (9) AÊ . Atoms (C2, C3, C16, O17, O18 and O19) around the benzene ring are coplanar [r.m.s. deviation 0.0535 (10) AÊ ]. Thus, the structure exhibits a planar central moiety, a typical structural feature observed in anti-leishmania inhibitors (Chan-Bacab & PenÄa-Rodrigues, 2001). Several packing features may be noted (Spek, 1990). There are classical intermolecular hydrogen bonds [O21Ð H21 O20i; symmetry code: (i) 1 2 ÿ x, 1 2 ÿ y, 1 ÿ z] between the COOH groups of neighbouring molecules, forming a centrosymmetric dimer (Fig. 2). O21 O20i is 2.6238 (12) AÊ and O21ÐH21 O20i is 171.1 (17). There is also a weak C16ÐH16B O21ii [symmetry code: (ii) x, ÿy, z ÿ 1 2] intermolecular hydrogen bond that is responsible for stabilization of the in®nite parallel chains (Fig. 3). Furthermore, two intermolecular CÐH interac- tions involve atoms C15 and C16 and the cloud of the benzene ring. The former is between atom H15A and the - ring of a molecule at (ÿx, 1 ÿ y, ÿz) and the second between atom H16A and the molecule at (ÿx, ÿy, ÿz). These are characterized by the distances C15 CgBz and C16 CgBz of 3.5534 (15) and 3.6568 (15) AÊ , respectively, and by the angles C15ÐH15A CgBz and C16ÐH16A CgBz of 129.4 (11) and 152.2 (11), respectively (CgBz denotes the centroid of the benzene ring). These interactions link in®nite parallel chains, as shown in Fig. 4. All geometrical details of the intermolecular contacts were interpreted as hydrogen bonds on geometrical grounds (Ellena et al., 2001); Table 2 reports the relevant geometrical parameters. Experimental The roots and leaves of A. fusci¯orus were collected in Manaus-AM/ Brazil in December 2000. An authenticated specimen was deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto de Pesquisas da Amazonia, INPA/ Brazil, reference code 189859.

The hexane extract of the root (5.0 g) was chromatographed on an silica gel column ( h = 28 2 cm) using a hexane/EtOAc gradient to fractionate the extract. Nine fractions were collected. Fraction 5 (hexane±ethyl acetate 7:3) was chroma- tographed on an silica gel column ( h = 50 1.5 cm) using a gradient system of hexane, ethyl acetate and methylene chloride. 42 fractions were collected and, based on normal phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC), seven fractions were pooled. Fraction 3 (hexane/ethyl acetate/methylene chloride 7:2:1) produced an amor- phous white solid (25 mg) that was washed successively with hexane and crystallized by vapor diffusion at room temperature from hexane/ methylene chloride (1:1). The purity of the compound was checked by TLC (silica gel, Merck PF 254, 0.25 mm thickness).

After decades of intensive searching for antimicrobial compounds derived from actinobacteria, the frequency of isolation of new molecules has decreased. To cope with this concern, studies have focused on the exploitation of actinobacteria from unexplored environments and actinobacteria symbionts of plants and animals. In this study, twenty-four actinobacteria strains isolated from workers of Trachymyrmex ants were evaluated for antifungal activity towards a variety of Candida species. Results revealed that seven strains inhibited the tested Candida species. Streptomyces sp. TD025 presented potent and broad spectrum of inhibition of Candida and was selected for the isolation of bioactive molecules. From liquid shake culture of this bacterium, we isolated the rare antimycin urauchimycins A and B. For the first time, these molecules were evaluated for antifungal activity against medically important Candida species. Both antimycins showed antifungal activity, especially urauchimycin B. This compound inhibited the growth of all Candida species tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin. Our results concur with the predictions that the attine ant-microbe symbiosis may be a source of bioactive metabolites for biotechnology and medical applications. 1. Introduction The increased resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics is a problem of public health [1]. The increasing number of fungal species that can infect humans, particularly immunocompro- mised individuals, further reinforces this concern. A limited number of antifungal agents are commercially available when compared to antibacterial drugs. This scenario motivates the search for new bioactive compounds in various biological systems using several approaches, including metagenomics and microbial genome-mining. Actinobacteria are widely known for their ability to pro- duce bioactive secondary metabolites, especially compounds with antimicrobial activity. These bacteria are responsible for producing two-thirds of the commercially available antibi- otics [2, 3]. Most actinobacteria species explored commer- cially were isolated from the soil. However, after decades of bioprospecting actinobacteria from this environment, it is becoming more difficult to obtain strains producing novel bioactive metabolites [4]. Thus, many companies have turned the search for microbial producers of novel antifungal com- pounds to other environments such as hydrothermal vents, 2 BioMed Research International marine environments, tropical rain forests, and microbial symbionts associated with plants and animals hosts [5, 6]. For example, the occurrence of actinobacteria associated with marine sponges and the fact that such strains produce com- pounds with antimicrobial activity confirms this potential [7– 9]. In addition, endophytic actinobacteria are also explored for their capacity to produce antimicrobial compounds [10– 12]. Several studies have focused on the association between actinobacteria and insects from an ecological perspective [13–25]. On the other hand, few studies have focused on the multitude of chemical compounds that are involved in such interactions [26]. The best studied example is the symbiosis between actinobacteria and fungus-growing ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: tribe Attini). In this association, the actinobacteria are found on the ants’ integument and produce antimicrobial compounds that help the ants to suppress the microfungus Escovopsis sp. [13, 14]. This fungus is considered a specialized parasite of the ant cultivar and causes negative impacts to the ant colony [27]. Actinobacteria isolated from the integument of attine ants are generally classified in the genus Pseudonocardia and Streptomyces. Bioactive molecules have already been isolated and characterized from actinobacteria isolated from several attine genera [26]. Pseudonocardia isolated from Acromyrmex octospinosus and Apterostigma dentigerum are known to pro- duce several compounds like (i) dentigerumycin, a complex compound active against Candida albicans and Escovopsis [28]; (ii) a nystatin-like antifungal [29]; (iii) the novel quinone pseudonocardones A–C active against the malaria causal agent Plasmodium berghei [30]; (iv) the already known antibi- otics 6-deoxy-8-O-methylrabelomycin and X-14 881, both active against Bacillus subtilis and P. berghei [30]. In addition to Pseudonocardia, actinobacteria in the genus Streptomyces are also found on the integument of Acromyrmex workers and were shown to produce (i) candicidin, active against Escovopsis sp. [29, 31–34], (ii) antimycins active against Escovopsis sp. [32–34], and (iii) actinomycin D, actinomycin X2 and valinomycin that are active against B. subtilis [32]. Poulsen [35] suggested that the attine ant-microbe asso- ciation is little explored regarding the search for new antimicrobials. The author highlights the various symbiotic associations between attine ants and microorganisms as a promising source for drug discovery, especially those with antimicrobial activity. Here, we explored the antimicrobial potential of actinobacteria isolated from the integument of Trachymyrmex fungus-growing ants and demonstrate the action against different medically important Candida species. We also report two previously described urauchimycins from a Streptomyces strain and emphasize the newly discovered anti-Candida activity of these compounds. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification. Twelve Trachymyrmex colonies were collected in different Brazilian biomes (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/835081). Colonies were carefully excavated in order to reach the first fungus garden chamber. Fungus garden with the tending workers and brood was sampled using an alcohol-flamed spoon and stored in sterile plastic containers. All containers were kept in a cooler during transport to the laboratory where they were maintained at 25∘C. From each colony, we randomly selected four workers for actinobacteria isolation. Then, the propleural plates were scraped with a sterile needle under a low power stereomicroscope. All ants used in the present study had a visible, whitish covering on the propleural plates. Scrapings were plated on SCN agar (in g ⋅L−1: 10.0 starch, 0.3 casein, 2.0 KNO3, 2.0 NaCl, 2.0 K2HPO4, 0.05 MgSO4 ⋅7 H2O, 0.02 CaCO3, 0.01 FeSO4 ⋅7H2O and 18.0 agar supplemented with 0.05 Nystatin) [36]. After scraping, the entire body of all workers was inoculated on SCN agar. All plates were incubated at 25∘C for 30 days. From each sampled Trachymyrmex colony, one representative strain was selected from each morphotype obtained. The strains were subcultured in YMA (in g ⋅L−1: 3.0 yeast extract, 3.0 malt extract, 5.0 peptone, 10.0 glucose, 18.0 agar) and stored at −80∘C in 15% glycerol. We used a molecular approach to provide taxonomic affiliation to actinobacteria strains. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method of Sampaio et al. [37]. We carried out 16S rDNA PCR with the universal primers 27F (5-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-3) and 1492R (5- TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3) [38]. Reactions were conducted in a final volume of 25 𝜇L and contained 1 𝜇L of diluted DNA template (1 : 10), 2.0 𝜇L of each primer (10 mM), 2.5 𝜇L of 10X buffer, 1.0 𝜇L of MgCl2 (50 mM), 4.0 𝜇L of dNTPs (1.25 mM each), 0.2 𝜇L of Taq polymerase (5 U/𝜇L), and 12.3 𝜇L of ultrapure water. Amplicons were cleaned up with GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purifica- tion Kit (GE Healthcare). Forward and reverse sequences were generated using the same primers, along with an internal primer U519F (5-CAGCMGCCGCGGTAATWC- 3). Sequences were generated using BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies) in an ABI 3130 sequencer and manually edited in BioEdit v. 7.1.3 [39]. Contigs were compared with those available in the databases NCBI- GenBank (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Ribossomal Database Project (RDP, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). Sequences generated in the present study were deposited in NCBI- GenBank (accessions KC480554-KC480557). A phylogenetic analysis was carried out in order to deter- mine the taxonomic affiliation of strain TD025. Sequences of closest relatives were retrieved from the NCBI-GenBank and the RDP Project and aligned in ClustalW. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in PAUP v. 4.0 [40]. Genetic dis- tances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model of nucleotide substitution [41]. Robustness of the relation- ships was estimated from 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. 2.2. Organic Extracts and Antifungal Assays. All actinobac- teria were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 50 mL of modified MPE medium (in g ⋅L−1: 5.0 soy flour, BioMed Research International 3 20.0 glucose, 5.0 of NaCl, 4.0 CaCO3) [42]. Each flask was inoculated with five mycelium disks (1 cm in diameter) cut from a previously grown culture and then incubated at 28∘C for two days on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. From this culture, 10 mL was inoculated in two Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 100 mL of the same medium and incu- bated for five days on the same conditions. After incubation, the fermented broth was separated from the mycelium by centrifugation and partitioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the EtOAc extracts were diluted in RPMI-1640 culture broth containing 10% DMSO and used in the antimicrobial assays. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evalu- ated against the yeasts Candida albicans CBS 562, Candida dubliniensis CBS 7987, Candida glabrata CBS 138, Candida krusei CBS 573, Candida parapsilosis CBS 604, and Candida tropicalis CBS 94. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the microdilution method according to the M27-A2 standard of the Clinical and Lab- oratory Standards Institute [43]. 2.3. Isolation and Characterization of the Bioactive Com- pounds of Strain TD025. The actinobacteria strain that exhib- ited both a broad antifungal spectrum and lower MIC values was strain TD025. In order to identify the compounds responsible for the observed results, the strain was cultured in 5 L of modified MPE medium and the extracts were obtained as described. The fermented broth (5 L) was separated from the cells by centrifugation and portioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The crude extract, a dark green oil (1.40 g), was separated by means of column chromatography using silica gel 60 eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc as the elution gradient, yielding 8 fractions. All fractions were submitted to antimicrobial assays against C. albicans following the procedure described above. The most active fraction (67.5 mg) was subjected to preparative TLC (thin layer chromatography) eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7 : 3) two times, yielding 3 subfractions. The subfractions obtained were submitted to antimicrobial assays against C. albicans. The most active subfraction was submitted to semipreparative HPLC separations carried out in a Shimadzu (LC-6AD apparatus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP). The separation was carried out using VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18 column eluted with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50 : 50 : 0.01) at a flow rate of 3 mL ⋅min−1, yielding com- pounds 1 and 2. The isolated molecules were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic experiments recorded on a BRUKER DRX-400 spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard. 2.4. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Fungi- cide Concentration of Bioactive Compounds. After isola- tion and determination of the structure of the targeted compounds, they were evaluated for antimicrobial activity following the method described previously. Besides the MIC determination, we also evaluated the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The MFC was determined by inoculat- ing Sabouraud dextrose medium with 10 𝜇L of the contents of each of the wells where there was growth inhibition of yeast, the MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the substance capable of preventing the onset of colony forming units. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification. Several acti- nobacteria colonies were observed after incubation of iso- lation plates. We selected just one morphotype of each per ant colony, rendering a total of 24 strains ouf of 12 Tra- chymyrmex spp. nests (Table S1). Four actinobacteria genera were identified and Streptomyces was the most abundant taxon (Table 1), corresponding to 66.67% of the strains. It is assumed that the main actinobacteria associated with the integument of attine workers is the genus Pseudonocardia [14–16, 20]. However, several authors have demonstrated the isolation of actinobacteria other than Pseudonocardia on the integument of attine ants [17–19, 21, 22, 29, 31]. The prevalence of Streptomyces and absence of Pseudonocardia among our isolates may be due to the culture medium used [44]. The SCN medium is suitable for the isolation of fast-growing actinobacteria, but according to other authors [13–16], the use of a low-nutrient medium, such as chitin agar, may provide the recovery of Pseudonocardia strains. In eight out of 12 ant colonies, we obtained more than one actinobacteria morphotype (Table S1). From colony CTL080820-02, the two morphotypes isolated from two different workers were identified as the same actinobacteria species (Tables S1 and 1). On the other hand, different actinobacteria species were isolated in the seven remaining colonies. We also observed the occurrence of different acti- nobacteria strains in a single worker (Tables S1 and 1). This result demonstrates the diversity of actinobacteria present on the integument of these ants (Table S1, nests SES080911-04 and SES080924-01). The 16S rDNA sequence of strain TD025 showed 99% similarity with sequences of several species of the genus Streptomyces deposited in the databases. For a better charac- terization, we performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). The result suggests a differentiated phylogenetic position for strain TD025 when compared with the remaining sequences. This preliminary analysis allowed us to assign this strain as belonging to the genus Streptomyces, with S. cirratus as the closest relative strain (Figure 1). However, more refined phylogenetic analyses, along with morphological and physi- ological studies, are necessary to ensure the identification of TD025 to the species level. 3.2. Screening for Antifungal Activity. Our screening for antifungal activity revealed that seven out of 24 extracts (29.16%) inhibited the growth of at least one Candida species. C. albicans was the most sensitive yeast and was 4 BioMed Research International Table 1: Actinobacteria identification according to 16S rDNA sequencing.

The yeasts C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were the most resistant strains, being inhibited by one and two actinobacteria extracts, respectively, with MIC values of 1000 𝜇g ⋅mL−1 (Table 2). Except for strain TD034 identified as Amycolatopsis decaplanina (Table 1), the other actinobacteria exhibiting antimicrobial activity were identified as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. This genus is recognized as the largest producer of antibiotics because from approximately 3,000 known antibiotics obtained from actinobacteria, the genus Streptomyces contributes with 90% of this total [45]. The extracts of Streptomyces sp. TD025 and Streptomyces crystallinus TD027 showed activity against all yeast strains except for C. glabrata. These extracts were effective against C. albicans and C. krusei and showed low activity against C. tropicalis (Table 2). More interestingly, both strains were isolated from the same colony but from independent workers (Table 1). Because lower MICs were obtained for the extract of Streptomyces sp. TD025, this strain was selected to verify the chemical compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity. 3.3. Bioactive Compounds of Streptomyces sp. TD025. Chro- matographic procedures revealed that EtOAc extract from TD025 contains two compounds (1 and 2, Figure 2). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited typical NMR data of urauchimycins (Figures S1 and S2). Their NMR data are in agreement with those previously reported by Imamura et al. [46]. Although these urauchimycins (1 and 2) have already been isolated, they have never been tested on various species of Candida as carried out in the present study. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 22 carbon signals: four carbonyls (𝛿179.0, 𝛿170.6, 𝛿169.8, and 𝛿158.7), three quaternary sp2 carbons (𝛿150.6, 𝛿127.4, and 𝛿112.8), three methine aromatic carbons (𝛿124.8, 𝛿120.6, and 𝛿119.0), two sp3 methylene group (𝛿35.6 and 𝛿30.5), three sp3 methine groups (𝛿54.0, 𝛿50.1, and 𝛿32.4), three oxymethinic groups (𝛿77.1, 𝛿76.3, and 𝛿70.9), and four methyl groups (𝛿18.4, 𝛿18.4, 𝛿15.1, and 𝛿11.4). Two carboxylic carbons 𝛿170.6 and 𝛿173.9 showed correlations with different hydrogens of the structure, showing a dilactone system of nine members, typical of the antimycin class. The 1H NMR spectrum showed a singlet at 𝛿8.50, assigned to a hydrogen bounded to a carbonyl group and three aromatic hydrogens at 𝛿8.55 (dd, J 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), 𝛿7.24 (dd, J 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), and d 6.92 (t, J 8.1 Hz), suggesting a 1,2,3 trisubstituted aromatic ring. The substance was identified as urauchimycin A by comparison with the literature data [46]. The 1H and 13C NMR spectram of 2 were very similar to those observed for compound 1. Differences were observed in chemical shifts of the hydrogen of the methyl and methylene BioMed Research International 5 100 73 65 74 98 100 100 86 58 58 68 71 0.001 Streptomyces sp.

The scale bar denotes the number of substitutions per site. groups of the side chain. Based on published data [46] compound 2 was identified as Urauchimycin B, an isomer of compound 1. Urauchimycins belong to the antimycin class, a group of well-known antifungals. Antimycins act by inhibiting the electron flow in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [47]. Antimycins have been previously identified in Streptomyces isolated from the integument of attine ants [32–34]. Schoe- nian and colleagues [32] detected the well-know antimycins A1–A4 in 50% of the actinobacteria identified as Streptomyces isolated from workers of several Acromyrmex species. These data along with the rare antimycins identified in the present study indicate that this chemical class is often produced by Streptomyces associated with attine ants. Compounds belonging to this class may have an important role in the attine ant-microbe association. Another antifungal compound widely distributed in Streptomyces associated with attine ants is candicidin [31–34], which was not detected in Streptomyces sp. TD025. It is possible that candicidin was lost in one of the purification steps of the AcOEt extract or it is not produced by this strain. Urauchimycins A and B were previously isolated from Streptomyces sp. Ni-80 isolated from a marine sponge in Urauchicove, Irimore, Japan. These substances were the first antimycins having an odd number of carbons and a branching side chain [46]. Imamura et al. [46] suggested that such structures are the result of an evolution of actinobacteria in the marine environment, which could have resulted in a change in their secondary metabolism. In 2006, two new urauchimycins were described: urau- chimycin C, isolated from Streptomyces sp. B1751 from marine sediment, and urauchimycin D, isolated from Streptomyces sp. AdM21 from soil [48]. In the study by Imamura and coworkers [46], the urauchimycins A and B inhibited the morphological differentiation of C. albicans up to a con- centration of 10 𝜇g ⋅mL−1. Urauchimycins C and D showed no inhibitory activity against C. albicans, Mucor miehei, and bacteria [48]. The study of antimicrobial activity of urauchimycins A and B was restricted to C. albicans in the work by Imamura and colleagues [46]. The reisolation of these molecules in the present study allowed a better evaluation of its spectrum of 6 BioMed Research International Table 2: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (𝜇g⋅mL−1) of actinobacteria extracts towards different medically important Candida species.

The urauchimycins from Streptomyces sp. TD025 pre- sented MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nys- tatin for C. albicans and C. glabrata (Table 3). Urauchimycin B showed inhibitory activity against all Candida strains eval- uated, showing MIC similar to those provided by nystatin. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity against Candida spp. with MIC values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin, which indicates the potential for medical use. For many years, antimycins were used for the treatment of human infections, but due to its mechanism of action and associated side effects, its use in human treatment was discontinued [47]. However, with the pressing need for new antifungal agents that complement or substitute for the scarce products available on the market, it is interesting and nec- essary to determine the toxicity presented by urauchimycin B, to assess whether it can be used as an antifungal agent for humans and animals. In addition, evaluation of the isolated compound against Candida species resistant to commercially available antifungal agents should be performed to confirm the potential of this relatively unexplored antifungal. Here we show that Trachymyrmex ants, one attine genus understudied with respect to its microbial symbionts, har- bor antimicrobial-producing actinobacteria. As observed by other authors [28–33], the present study demonstrates that BioMed Research International 7 Table 3: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicide concentrations (MFC) (𝜇g⋅mL−1) of Urauchimycins A and B obtained from Streptomyces sp.

Moreover, our study corroborates previous work [35] that suggests the attine ant-microbe association is a promising source of microorganisms that produce active metabolites. The few recent studies that focused on the chemical charac- terization of bioactive compounds produced by actinobacte- ria associated with attine ants support the potential isolation of novel molecules with biological activity [28–32]. Thus, an exploration program of isolation of bioactive molecules from actinobacteria from attine ants certainly will result in the discovery of novel compounds with activity against microorganisms that are potentially pathogenic to humans. 4. Conclusion As suggested by Poulsen [35], we found that the integument of Trachymrymex ants is a potential source for the isolation of actinobacteria that produce bioactive molecules. The isola- tion of Urauchimycins A and B enabled, for the first time, the evaluation of their activity against various Candida species. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity and MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nystatin. Toxicity studies and in vivo activity should be carried out in order to verify the potential use of this molecule in the treatment of fungal infections.

These drugs are, however, not consistently effective and, moreover, exhibit serious side effects including cardiac and/or renal toxicity.2) There is thus particular inter- est in the discovery of natural products that might be devel- oped to generate safer and more efﬁcient chemotherapeutic agents against T. cruzi.3) A number of biologically-active chromenes have been isolated from species of the genus Piper, including the prenylated chromene 1 from Piper gaudichaudianum4) and chromenes 2—5 (Fig. 1) from P. aduncum.5) Whilst these chromenes have been shown to exhibit anti-fungal4) and anti- tumour properties,5) no evaluation has yet been made with respect to their activity against T. cruzi. The object of the present study was to examine a range of natural chromenes and chromene derivatives in order to determine their poten- tial for further development to treat Chagas disease. METHODS AND RESULTS General All reagents were of analytical grade. For methylation reactions, an ethereal solution of diazomethane (30 ml) was prepared by dissolving 2.14 g of N-methyl-N-ni- troso-p-toluenesulphonamide (Diazald; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 10.0 ml of ethanol containing 4.0% potassium hydroxide.6) Hydrogenation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium (3.0 or 10.0%) on activated charcoal (Acros Organics, New Jer- sey, U.S.A.) as catalyst.7) The acetylated chromene was pre- pared by treatment with acetic anhydride (20.0 ml) and pyri- dine (20.0 ml) overnight.8) Benznidazole, employed as posi- tive control in the assays of trypanocidal activity, was ob- tained from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Plant Material Specimens of P. gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum were cultivated from seed under greenhouse con- ditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru) and voucher specimens (with codes Kato 0093 and 0057, respectively) were deposited at the Herbarium of the 538 Vol. 31, No. 3 Notes Natural Chromenes and Chromene Derivatives as Potential Anti-trypanosomal Agents João Marcos BATISTA Jr.,a Adriana Aparecida LOPES,a Daniela Luz AMBRÓSIO,b Luis Octávio REGASINI,a Massuo Jorge KATO,c Vanderlan da Silva BOLZANI,a Regina Maria Barretto CICARELLI,b and Maysa FURLAN*,a a Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Prof. Francisco Degni, 14801–970, Araraquara, SP, Brazil: b Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Rodovia Araraquara/Jaú Km 1, 14801–902, Araraquara, SP, Brazil and c Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo; Av.

Received September 18, 2007; accepted December 6, 2007; published online December 13, 2007 The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-trypanocidal activities of natural chromene and chromene derivatives. Five chromenes were isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum, and a further seven de- rivatives were prepared using standard reduction, methylation and acetylation procedures. These compounds were assayed in vitro against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The results showed that the most of the compounds, especially those possessing electron-donating groups as sub- stituents on the aromatic ring, showed potent trypanocidal activity. The most active compound, [(2S)-methyl-2- methyl-8-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate], was almost four times more potent than benznidazole (the positive control) and showed an IC50 of 2.82 mM. The results reveal that chromenes exhibit signiﬁcant anti-trypanocidal activities and indicate that this class of natural product should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas dis- ease.

Evaluation of Trypanocidal Activity Assays of the anti- parasitic activities of the isolates and their derivatives were conducted by screening their effects on the proliferation of epimastigotes of T. cruzi Y-strain grown in axenic culture in LIT medium. Stock solutions (containing 1.0 mg/ml) of the natural chromenes and their derivatives were prepared in di- methylsulphoxide and serially diluted (1 : 3) in liver infusion tryptose medium to yield sample solutions with concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg/ml. The number of remaining viable protozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber following incubation at 28 °C for 72 h with the test sample. All assays were con- ducted in triplicate. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined by linear regression analysis. The IC50 values for compounds 1—12 and for benznidazole (em- March 2008 539 ployed as positive control) are shown in Table 1. For the sta- tistical analysis, method of probits was employed. DISCUSSION As part of an on-going screening program for new anti- chagasic drugs, the prenylated chromene [(2S)-2-methyl-8- (3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H- chromene-6-carboxylic acid] (1), the major metabolite of the ethanolic extract of Piper gaudichaudianum,4) was evaluated with respect to its toxicity against epimastigotes of T. cruzi and exhibited a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 value of 33.8 mM. On the basis of this ﬁnding, the natural benzopyrans 2—5 (isolated from P. aduncum) were assayed for trypanoci- dal activity together with some novel chromene derivatives obtained from 1, 3, 4 and 5 by simple chemical transforma- tions. Speciﬁcally, hydrogenation7) of the isoprene units and of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring of 1 produced the derivative 6. The benzopyran ester 7 was obtained from 1 by methylation with diazomethane,6) and this ester was subse- quently reduced to 8 by catalytic hydrogenation. Similarly, derivatives 9 and 10 were obtained from chromenes 3 and 4, respectively, whilst derivative 11 was obtained by selective hydrogenation of 5. Finally the chromene 4 was acetylated to 12. Most of the isolates together with their derivatives showed signiﬁcant trypanocidal activities in comparison with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 10.3 mM). Compound 7 proved to be the most active with an IC50 value of 2.82 mM, i.e. almost four times more potent than benznidazole. All compounds that showed activity possessed electron- donating substituents. Within this group the prenylated com- pounds 1, 5, 7 and 11 were the most active, whilst the ester derivative 7 (containing two prenyl units) was an extremely powerful trypanocidal agent with a potency ca. 10-fold greater than that of the corresponding acid. This ﬁnding sug- gests that both prenyl and ester substituents are necessary for the strongest anti-parasitic activity. The lower activity exhib- ited by chromene 2 compared with 3 corroborates the impor- tance of an ester group, and indicates a direct correlation be- tween the electronic nature of the substituents and trypanoci- dal activity. Moreover, the observed reduction in activity of 12 occasioned by the introduction of an electron-withdraw- ing acetyl group at C-8 following acetylation8) of 4, substan- tiates the inﬂuence of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1). Reduction of the double bonds of the prenyl substituents (as in derivatives 6 and 8) gave rise to a signiﬁcant decrease in toxicity indicating their essential role in trypanocidal ac- tivity. Furthermore, reduction of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring (as in derivatives 9 and 10) resulted in the total loss of toxicity suggesting that a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring is essential for trypanocidal activity. These results suggest that substituents on the aromatic ring that contribute to an increase in lipophilicity are also re- quired for activity (Table 1). In conclusion, several natural chromenes from P. gau- dichaudianum and P. aduncum, along with a series of semi- synthetic derivatives, have been shown to exhibit potential trypanocidal activities against epimastigotes of T. cruzi. The results suggest that chromenes should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.

Received July 2, 2007; accepted January 24, 2008; published online January 28, 2008 In early studies, we have reported the antinociceptive proﬁle of ()-spectaline, a piperidine alkaloid from Cassia spectabilis. The present study describes the synthesis, the antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities of a series of 2,3,6-trialkyl-piperidine alkaloids: the natural ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) and ten semi-synthetic spectaline derivatives. Structure–activity relationship (SARs) studies were performed. The struc- tures of all synthesized derivatives were conﬁrmed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance. Compounds were evaluated for their analgesic (acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constrictions, hot-plate test, formalin-in- duced pain test) and some of them for the anti-inﬂammatory activities (carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test). The pharmacological results showed that several of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than ()-spectaline. LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. In the formalin-induced pain only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the in- ﬂammatory phase, ()-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity. In the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, only ()-spectaline exhibited an anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg. Our results suggest different mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio-776 (3-O-Boc- spectaline), LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl-spectaline) and ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754). The antinociceptive proﬁle of some of the semi-synthetic spectaline derivatives extends our research concerning the chemical and pharmaco- logical optimization of isolated natural products in the search of new drug candidates from brazilian biodiver- sity.

Design Concept of the New 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Derivatives writhing test (ED5048.5 mmol/kg) and capsaicin induced pain (ED5020.8 mmol/kg).8) Extending our research program concerning the bio- prospection of natural products and its derivatives, we have selected, to conclude this investigation, another abundant piperidine alkaloid, ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio- 755, Chart 1) and synthesized other 10 semi-synthetic deriva- tives prepared from natural ()-spectaline, i.e. a series of 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloids. The present study was focused on the synthesis, evaluation of antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory properties and structure–activity rela- tionship (SAR) analysis of these new derivatives in order to verify the stereoelectronic contributions and requirements of the pharmacophoric groups A, B and C for the antinocicep- tive and anti-inﬂammatory activities (Chart 1). Results and Discussion The antinociceptive proﬁle of all new 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine derivatives developed herein was initially evalu- ated using classical acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constriction test,9) with indomethacin as standard. The results are disclosed in Fig. 1. Some of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than ()-spectaline and indomethacin. Among them, the natural acetate derivative (LASSBio-755) and its O-Boc analogue (LASSBio-776) were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. Based on these results some preliminary structure–activity relationships were analysed. Comparing the inhibitory proﬁle of compounds LASSBio- 782, LASSBio-821 and LASSBio-775 with LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755 indicates that the presence of groups that blocked the hydrogen bond donnor character of the piperi- dine nitrogen seems to be deletery for the analgesic activity. On the other hand, the antinociceptive activity showed to be inversely dependent of the volume of the groups at C-3 (OR1 group) once that the inhibition of the constrictions follows the order R1HAcBoc. The introduction of more polar and hydrogen bond-donating hydroxy groups at C-13 in the alcohol or oxime derivatives, i.e. LASSBio-781, LASSBio- 820 and LASSBio-784, did not result in a increase of the an- tinociceptive activity but indicated through the direct com- parison of the bioproﬁle of compounds LASSBio-781 and LASSBio-820 that the stereochemistry at C-3 seems to be a pharmacophoric requirement for an adequate ﬁt in the target receptor. Additionally, the introduction of an acetyl group at C-3 of LASSBio-755 modify drastically the toxicological as- pect of these alkaloids, once that it did not show any sign of toxicity when administered at a single dose of 500 mmol/kg (data not shown) in contrast with ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754).8) Considering the signiﬁcant antinociceptive activity ob- served for LASSBio-755 and its analogue LASSBio-776 we decided to investigate its effects on other models of pain and compare the results with that showed by ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754).8) In the formalin-induced pain10) only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the inﬂammatory phase, ()-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity (Fig. 2). Indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the later phase without interfering on the earlier one in the formalin-induced pain test.11) These results on the for- malin test led us to investigate the anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle of these same compounds on the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema.9) LASSBio-755 and, unexpectedly, LASSBio- 776 did not show an anti-inﬂammatory activity at the dose used. Only ()-spectaline was able to inhibit the edema for- mation, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg (Fig. 3). The same order of potency was observed for both antinociceptive (ED5048.5 mmol/kg)8) and anti-inﬂammatory (ED5056.6 mmol/kg) (Fig. 3) activities of ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754), indicating a common pathway of action. Despite the absence of effect on the neurogenic phase of the formalin test at the dose used, LASSBio-755 and LASS- Bio-776 showed a signiﬁcant increase in the latency time in the hot-plate test,12) similar to morphine, while ()-spec- taline (LASSBio-754), even at a dose of 300 mmol/kg, was inactive (Fig. 4). The hot-plate and formalin test differs in some aspects. Hot-plate test is based on the use of a short-duration nocicep- tive thermal stimulus (phasic pain) while formalin use a long-duration chemical stimulus (tonic pain). Tissue injury leads to a persistent afferent input in the latter. The nocicep- tive response in the ﬁrst phase of formalin and hot-plate models seems to result from direct activation of nociceptors and is inhibited by drugs which act mainly at central sites.13,14) Centrally acting analgesics are also effective in the second phase.10) This phase is attributed mainly to the devel- opment of an inﬂammatory reaction at the site of injection and increased synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.13) 408 Vol. 56, No. 4 Fig. 1.

Considering the central activity observed for LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 in the hot-plate test, it was expected to observe some activity in the earlier phase of the formalin that could be dependent of the magnitude of the dose. The ﬁrst phase of formalin is brief and occurs in the ﬁrst 5 min. The ﬁrst measure in the hot-plate test was at 30 min and only LASSBio-755 showed a signiﬁcant activity. LASSBio-776 showed a signiﬁcant activity from 60 min. Since the com- pounds were administered orally and the dose used was the same in both tests, the lack of activity on the neurogenic phase could be related with the pharmacokinetics proﬁle of the compounds and somewhat with the mechanisms of the pain processing in these different models. Recently, searching for new candidates compounds useful for treating Alzheimer’s disease, the chloride analogues of some of these semi-synthetic piperidine alkaloid derivatives were described as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.15) The cholinergic system was involved in the transmission of noci- ceptive information and cholinergic drugs, such as mus- carinic and nicotinic agonists, and also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were described to induce antinociception.16—18) The acetylcholine-induced constriction test has been used for screening analgesic compounds.19) In this model ()-spec- taline and LASSBio-776 similarly inhibited the constrictions by 44.7% and 47.9%, respectively, while LASSBio-755 showed a more important antinociceptive effect, inhibiting the constrictions by 82% (Fig. 5). These results in addition with the hot-plate test and the acetylcholinesterase in- hibition15) suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the antinociceptive response elicited by LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755. Taken together these results suggest differents mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio- 776 (3-O-Boc-spectaline) and LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl- spectaline), acting mainly by modulation of receptors located at central nervous system, and for ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754) that showed to be a peripheral analgesic and anti-in- ﬂammatory agent. In conclusion, this study revealed new analgesic com- pounds derived from ()-spectaline without apparent toxic- ity and gave support to the strategy of modiﬁcations of iso- lated natural products from brazilian biodiversity seeking the optimization of the biological activities in the search of new drug candidates. Experimental Chemistry The natural alkaloids ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754) and ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) were obtained from the ethanolic extract of ﬂowers of Cassia spectabilis (DC.) IRWIN et BARN (Leguminosae), as previously described. 6,7) For the preparation of the target derivatives from ()-spectaline (LASS- Bio-754) the reaction sequences outlined in Chart 2 were followed. Reaction of LASSBio-754 with HCl under anhydrous conditions in CH2Cl2 yielded the hidrochloride LASSBio-768. Carbamate LASSBio-775 and carbonate LASSBio-776 were prepared, as a 1 : 2 mixture, by reaction of LASSBio- 754 with (BOC)2O/Et3N in CH2Cl2.20—22) Silyl ether LASSBio-777 was obtained by reaction of LASSBio-754 with tert-butyl dimethyl silyl triﬂate (TBSOTf)/2,6-lutidine in CH2Cl2.23,24) Treatment of carbonate LASSBio- 776 with BzCl/4-DMAP/Et3N25,26) and MsCl/Et3N in CH2Cl2 afforded N- benzoyl carbonate LASSBio-782 and N-methanesulfonyl carbonate LASS- Bio-821, respectively. Oxidation of LASSBio-754 under Jones conditions yielded the diketone LASSBio-766, that was subsequently reduced with LiAlH4 in THF to afford LASSBio-820. Reduction of LASSBio-754 with NaBH4 in MeOH furnished LASSBio-781, that differs from LASSBio-820 at the absolute conﬁguration on C-3. Finally, LASSBio-754 was converted into the oxime LASSBio-784 by reaction with NH2OH·HCl in pyridine/ EtOH.27,28) Melting points were determined with a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melt- ing point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were April 2008 409 Fig. 3.

Pharmacology Experiments were carried out in albino swiss mice (20—25 g) and rats (150—200 g) of both sexes from LASSBio (Faculty of Pharmacy, UFRJ, Brazil) breeding unit. All animals were kept in standard- ized conditions, maintained only with water ad libitum for 12 h before the experiment. Animal experiments were performed according to the “Princi- ples of Laboratory Animal Care and Use in Research” (Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal-COBEA/Instituto Brasileiro Carlos Chagas Filho-IBCCFO, Brazil), based on international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and ethical guidelines for investigation of experi- mental pain in conscious animals.29) All compounds were administered orally (0.1 ml/20 g) as a suspension in arabic gum (0.5% in saline) (vehicle) 1 h before the noxius stimulus. In- domethacin was used as standard. Results are expressed as meanS.E.M. of “n” animals per group and the activities expressed as percentage of inhibi- tion when compared with the vehicle control group. The data were statisti- cally analyzed by the Student’s t test for a signiﬁcance level of ∗p0.05. When appropriated, the ED50 values (i.e. the dose able to elicit 50% of the maximum effect observed) were determined by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software. Acetic Acid-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice The antinoci- ceptive activity was determined in vivo using the mouse abdominal constric- tion test induced by acetic acid 0.6% (0.1 ml/10 g; i.p.).9) Compounds and in- domethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Ten minutes after i.p. injection of the acetic acid the number of constrictions per animal was recorded for 20 min. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Acetylcholine-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice Constric- tions were induced by acetylcholine (4.0 mg/kg; i.p.) and the number of con- strictions per animal was recorded for 10 min.30) ()-Spectaline, LASSBio- 755 and LASSBio-776 were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Formalin-Induced Pain in Mice The formalin-induced pain test was carried out as described by Hunskaar and Hole.10) Animals were injected subplantarly with 20 ml of 2.5% formalin in hind paw. ()-Spectaline, LASSBio-755, LASSBio-776, indomethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. The time that mice spent licking or biting the injected paw or leg was recorded. Two distinct periods of intensive licking activity were identiﬁed and scored separately unless otherwise stated. The ﬁrst period (earlier or neurogenic phase) was recorded 0—5 min after formalin injection and the second period (later or inﬂammatory phase) was recorded 15— 30 min after injection. Anti-inﬂammatory Activity The anti-inﬂammatory activity was deter- mined in vivo using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test as previ- ously described.9) ()-Spectaline and indomethacin were administered at a range dose of 10—300 mmol/kg and 0.3—100 mmol/kg respectively, LASS- Bio-755 and LASSBio-776 at 100 mmol/kg. Animals were then injected subplantarly with either 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenan solution in saline (0.1 mg/paw) or sterile saline (NaCl 0.9%) into one of the hind paw, respec- tively. The paw volumes were measured using a glass plethysmometer cou- pled to a peristaltic pump, 3 h after the subplantar injection. The edema was calculated as the volume difference between the carrageenan and saline- treated paw. Hot-Plate Test Central analgesic activity was investigated using the hot plate test as described earlier.12) In these experiments, the hot plate apparatus (Ugo Basile, Model-DS 37) was maintained at 561 °C. Mice were placed on the heated surface and the time between placement and the ﬁrst sign of paw licking or jumping was recorded as latency. Latency was recorded at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral administration of vehicle, morphine (39.5 mmol/kg, used as positive control) or compounds (100 mmol/kg). The basal latencies were found to be 6—10 s. A cut-off time of 30 s was followed to prevent any injury to the paws.

In this context, some enzymes such as cyclooxygenases, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) have been widely rec- ognized as powerful targets for the action of anti-inﬂamma- tory agents.1—3) MPO is a leukocyte-derived heme peroxi- dase which has long been considered as a microbial enzyme centrally linked to the unspeciﬁc immune defense system. MPO plays an important role in oxidants production by poly- morphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). It uses hydrogen perox- ide (H2O2) and chloride gas to catalyze the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which contributes to both micro- bial killing, and subsequent oxidative injury of host tissue triggering severe inﬂammatory disorders,4) including rheuma- toid arthritis,5) inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD),6) cystic ﬁbrosis,7) neonatal lung injury,8) and adult respiratory distress syndrome.9) Thus, the search for new MPO inhibitors from natural sources can provide prototypes for the anti-inﬂamma- tory drug discovery, and design of novel therapeutic strate- gies. Pterogyne nitens TULASNE (Fabaceae) popularly known as “cocal”, “yvira-ró”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” is a highly branched and ca. 5—12 m high tree.10) Its wood is used for house building, for furniture and to make bows.11) In folk medicine, stem barks have been used as antiparasitic agent e.g., for treatment of ascariasis.12) As previously reported, the leaves of P. nitens yielded ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which ex- hibited cytotoxic activity against the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against to CHO Aux B1 cells.13) Preliminary study on additional bio- logical activities of P. nitens indicated a strong inhibition of rat paw edema suggesting the presence of anti-inﬂammatory compounds in its leaves EtOH extract which prompted us to investigate its chemical composition and evaluate the antioxi- dant and MPO inhibitory properties of the isolates. Experimental Plant Material Leaves of Pterogyne nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher speci- men (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Insti- tute (SP, Brazil). Isolation and Puriﬁcation The shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (1.8 l3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with ethanol (2.7 l3) at room temper- ature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-butanol. After solvent removal using a rotaevaporator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1—E11). Chromatographic puriﬁcation of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (46 : 53.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 10 ml/min] led to the isolation of compounds 1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (55 : 44.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 13 ml/min], afford- ing compound 3 (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identiﬁcation as compound 5 (130 mg). The butanol frac- tion (1.8 g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1—B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4—B6 were combined (333 mg) and pu- riﬁed by RP-HPLC (MeOH : H2O : AcOH (68 : 31.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm and ﬂow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds 2 (66 mg) and 4 (89 mg). Radical Scavenging Activity (RSA) Antioxidant activity of com- pounds 1—6 was determined using DPPH· (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS· [2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as- reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1—6 and positive controls at various con- centrations (33.3—1.7 mM) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 mM DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS· was pre- pared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mM) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1 : 0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12—16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS· stock solution was diluted with KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1 : 10 before use) buffer solution (ratio 1 : 88). ABTS· solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds 1—6 and positive controls (0.5—7.0 mg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical May 2008 723 Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory and Radical Scavenging Activities of Flavones from Pterogyne nitens Daniara Cristina FERNANDES,a Luis Octávio REGASINI,a José Carlos Rebuglio VELLOSA,b Patrícia Mendonça PAULETTI,a Ian CASTRO-GAMBOA,a Vanderlan Silva BOLZANI,a Olga Maria Mascarenhas OLIVEIRA,b and Dulce Helena Siqueira SILVA*,a a NuBBE-Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Department of Organic Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil: and b Department of Biochemistry and Chemical Technology, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil. Received December 22, 2007; accepted February 12, 2008; published online February 18, 2008 Two new ﬂavone glucosides, nitensosides A and B (1, 2), together with four known compounds, sorbifolin (3), sorbifolin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (4), pedalitin (5), and pedalitin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (6) were isolated from Pterogyne nitens. Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolu- tion mass spectrometry. All the isolated ﬂavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory ac- tivity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nM on MPO. Additionally, the radical- scavenging capacity of ﬂavones 1—6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox®.

Anti-radical abilities against ABTS· and DPPH· species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition[1(Asample/A)100], where A is test absorbance without sam- ple (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with com- pounds 1—6 or positive controls. Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity Inhibitory effects of 7-me- thoxyﬂavones 1—6 on MPO were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample con- centrations of compounds 1—6 (0.50—50 nM) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibi- tion expressed in concentration-response curves. Results and Discussion Nitensoside A (1) was obtained as yellow amorphous pow- der. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (a,b-unsaturated CO), 1606, 1502, 1452 (CC, aro- matic), and a broad band at 1160 cm1, indicating the pres- ence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These re- sults strongly suggested that compound 1 is a ﬂavonoid gly- coside.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two anomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at d 4.92 (1H, d, J7.0 Hz, H-1), d 4.45 (1H, d, J1.5 Hz, H-1), d 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a), d 3.70 (1H, dd, J10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b), and d 1.04 (1H, d, J6.0 Hz, H-6) suggested the presence of one b-glucopyranosyl and one a-rhamnopyranosyl unit in compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at d 102.4 (C-1), d 100.6 (C-1), d 66.6 (C-6) and d 17.7 (C-6). In the aromatic moiety of compound 1, signals at d 7.96 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-2, 6), 6.94 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-3, 5), 6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4-trihydroxy- ﬂavone).17,19) The singlet at d 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the ﬂavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR res- onance at d 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton signal at d 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.90, which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at d 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations conﬁrmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4-trihydroxy-7-methoxyﬂavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolinH] ion at m/z 301 observed in ﬁrst-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound 1.

Assignment of the inner sugar res- onances was achieved by using the anomeric proton reso- nance at d 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of 1H–1H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (J7.0 Hz) conﬁrmed the b-linkage of the ﬁrst glucosyl moiety. The downﬁeld shift of C-6 (5.5 ppm) and upﬁeld shift of C-5 (1.4 ppm) glucopyra- nosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin- 6-O-b-glucopyranoside,19) indicated that the rhamnopyra- nosyl moiety was attached at C-6. Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at d 100.6 (C-1) and d 3.70 (H-6) conﬁrmed the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage of compound 1. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound 1 showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [MH] at 607.1657 m/z, in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C28H31O15 (607.1657). Compound 2 was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 623.1600 (Calcd 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C28H31O16. The UV and IR spectra of 2 were similar to those of compound 1 suggesting a 6-O- glucosylﬂavone derivative. The IR of 2 showed a broad hy- droxyl band at 3427 cm1, and an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm1, in addition to a C–O stretching band at 1045 cm1, indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of 2 exhibited absorption maxima typical of a ﬂavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The 1H- and 13C-NMR data (Table 1) suggested that compound 2 had the same 7- methoxyﬂavone skeleton as compound 1, except for the pres- ence of a hydroxy group at C-3. In fact, the major difference between compounds 1 and 2 was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at d 7.42 (1H, dd, J8.5, 2.0 Hz, H-6), d 7.50 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz, H-2), and d 6.88 (1H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-5) for compound 2. The 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 2 presented 28 signals, deduced from distor- tionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90°, DEPT 135° and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, ﬁfteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quater- nary carbons, including one a,b-unsaturated ketone at d 182.1, which conﬁrmed the ﬂavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC cor- relation of signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.88 (OMe) in addition to NOESY interaction of signals at d 3.88 and d 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at d 128.0 (C-6) and d 4.89 (H-1), and between signals at d 66.5 (C-6) and d 4.43 (H-1) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage in compound 2. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures of ﬂavones 1 and 2 were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-O-a- rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyﬂavones were isolated and identiﬁed as sorbifolin (3),20) sorbifolin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (4),20) pedalitin (5),20) and pedalitin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (6).13) The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay.14,15) Pedalitin deriva- tives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin de- rivatives, probably due to presence of the ortho-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity.21,22) Pedalitin deriva- tives 2, 5 and 6 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC50 (mM) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC50 values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives 1, 3 and 4 (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the cathecol moi- ety on the B-ring of ﬂavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin de- rivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (5) when compared to its glucosides 2 and 6 in both assays, evi- dencing the inﬂuence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and there- fore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference com- pound quercetin (IC50 4.12 mM), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones.23) Similarly, this trend has also been ob- served for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC50 (5.7 mM to- wards ABTS, and 13.5 mM towards DPPH) than its 6-O-glu- cosyl derivatives 1 and 4, thus conﬁrming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi- calar activity of 7-methoxyﬂavones. Although a broad spectrum of the effects on mam- malian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids,24) few studies have been devoted to the MPO in- hibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols.25,26) MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modiﬁcations.16) The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds 2, 5 and 6, displaying a 3,4-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC50 values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1, 3 and 4, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohy- droxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides 1, 2, 4 and 6 showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between May 2008 725 Fig. 2. Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds 1 and 2 MPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inﬂammation derived diseases. Conclusion The association of antiradicalar properties and MPO in- hibitory activity observed for ﬂavones 1—6, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated ﬂavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inﬂammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme in- volved in inﬂammatory processes.

Naturforsch. 60b, 787 – 791 (2005); received September 17, 2004 The stems of Pilocarpus grandiﬂorus have afforded the new imidazole alkaloid 4,6-dehydro- 1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-2,5-dioxopilocarpine in addition to the 17 known compounds germanicol, β- amiryn, ocotillone, stigmast-4-en-3-one, 3β-hydroxy-stigmast-5-en-7-one, 6β-hydroxy-stigmast-4- en-3-one, β-sitosterol, scopoletin, 3-(1’,1’-dimethylallyl)-scopoletin, elisin, dictamine, 4-methoxy-2- quinolone, platydesmine, syringaresinol, syringaldehyde, syringic acid and vanillic acid. Their struc- tures were elucidated on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence. The phenolic compounds vanillic acid and syringaldehyde and the furoquinoline alkaloid platydesmine exhibited antifungal ac- tivity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, the symbiotic fungus of leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens rubropilosa). Key words: Pilocarpus grandiﬂorus, Jaborandi, Imidazole Alkaloid, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, Atta sexdens rubropilosa Introduction Pilocarpus commonly known as “Jaborandi” is a shrub belonging to the Rutaceae and comprises 16 neotropical species spread over tropical and subtrop- ical America. In Brazil, the occurrence of thirteen species [1] has been reported. This genus has long been known as the most important source of the imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine. Imidazole alkaloids are histamine derivatives found only in the genus Casimiroa and Pi- locarpus [2]. The alkaloid content in some Pilocar- pus (0.5– 1.0%) consists mainly of the imidazole alka- loid pilocarpine, together with small amounts of pilo- sine and related structures. Pilocarpine salts are valu- able in ophthalmic practice and used in eyedrops as miotics and for the treatment of glaucoma [3]. Leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyr- mex are among the most polyphagousagricultural pests of the South American countries. These ants cut veg- etables for substrate of their symbiotic food fungus and produce consistent economic damage to the harvesting of the cultivated plants. The agricultural pest control 0932–0776 / 05 / 0700–0787 $ 06.00 c⃝2005 Verlag der Zeitschrift f¨ur Naturforschung, T¨ubingen · http://znaturforsch.com practices generally involve toxic bait applications dam- aging the environment [4]. An alternative control for these insects can be achieved by inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus through more selective and less toxic natural products than the baits existent in the market. In this paper, we report the isolation of 18 com- pounds, the structural elucidation of a new imidazole alkaloid and the evaluation of their activities as in- hibitors of the growth of the symbiotic fungus Leuco- agaricus gongylophorus of leaf-cutting ants, Atta sex- dens rubropilosa. Results and Discussion In continuation of our search for compounds to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants [5 – 15], we have investigated the dichloromethane extract of the stems of P. grandiﬂorus leading to the isolation of a new imidazole alkaloid (1) in addition to the known compounds germanicol (2) [16], β-amiryn (3) [17], ocotillone (4) [18], β-sitosterol (5) [19], stigmast- Unauthenticated Download Date | 12/27/18 5:31 PM 788 R.

The known compounds were identiﬁed by compar- ison of their physical and spectral data with those al- ready reported in the literature. The new imidazole alkaloid had its structure determined on the basis of chemical and spectral evidence. The new alkaloid 1 had spectroscopic characteristics of the known imi- dazole alkaloid pilocarpine. The HREIMS spectrum displayed a molecular ion at m/z 238.0935 in accor- dance with the molecular formula C11H14O4N2. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals at δ = 1.01 (3H, t, J = 7.4 Hz), δ = 1.84 (1H, m) and δ = 1.38 (1H, m) indicating an ethyl group; two double- doublets at δ = 4.42 (1H, dd, J = 9.0, 5.4 Hz) and δ = 4.08 (1H, dd, J = 9.0, 2.0 Hz) for protons of oxy- genated carbons at δ = 71.7 and other lactone carbon at δ = 177.8 and the signals at δ = 2.67 (1H, ddd, J = 8.0, 7.0, 5.0 Hz), δ = 4.76 (1H, dddd, J = 11.5, 7.0, 5.4, 2.0 Hz) indicating a pattern similar to pi- locarpine. The 13C NMR spectrum for 1 (Table 1) showed eleven carbons in agreement with the imi- dazole alkaloid structure. The signals at δ = 177.7, 162.4, 152.4, 132.2 and 112.3 suggesting a change in the structure of pilocarpine with two additional car- bonyl groups and a double bond. The absence of a signal in the aromatic region and the signal at δ = 5.23 (1H, d, 11.0 Hz) in addition to the two carbonyl observed in the 13C NMR spectrum suggests a mod- iﬁcation of the imidazole ring. This is supported by HMBC spectrum (Table 2), which showed a correla- tion of the N-methyl group to the carbonyl C-2 and C-9 at δ = 152.4 (3J) and 162.4 (3J), and from H-6 to Table 2.

In the HSQC spectrum, the carbon at δ = 35.7 was cor- related with the signal at δ = 4.76. This value can be explained by anisotropic effects of the carbonyl group and the double bond. The G-NOESY experiments (Ta- ble 3) showed correlations of H-6 with the N-3-methyl group and H-8, requiring a cis conﬁguration for the double bond. The dichloromethane extract of the stems as well as fractions of P. grandiﬂorus showed strong inhibitory activity on the growth of L. gongylophorus. Among the 18 isolated compounds, the phenolic compounds syringaldehyde(10) and vanillic acid (12) and the furo- quinoline alkaloid platydesmine (18) exhibited higher inhibition of the fungal growth at 50 µg ml−1. Antifungal activities have been described for pheno- lic compounds against Cladosporium herbarum [33], Aspergillus ﬂavus and A. parasiticus [34], Geotrichum candidum, Coriolus versicolor, Phanerochaete chryso- sporium and Mycelia sterilia [35]. Grayer and Harbone [36] suggested that furoquino- line alkaloids might also play a role in the defense of plants against potentially pathogenic fungi.

(Lamiaceae, formely Verbenaceae) and Siphoneugena densiflora O. Berg (Myrtaceae) were screened for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypano- soma cruzi and T. brucei, as well as for their enzymatic inhibitory activities on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and trypanothione reductase (TR) enzymes from T. cruzi and adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) enzyme from Leish- mania tarentolae. In general, polar extracts displayed strong effects and some of the tested compounds have shown good results in comparison to positive controls of the bioassays. Key words: Myrtaceae, Trypanosoma, Leishmania Introduction Siphoneugena densiflora O. Berg commonly known as Uvatinga belongs to the family Myrta- ceae and occurs in grasslands (“campos rupes- tres”), deciduous forests (“cerrado˜es”) and gallery forests in Goia´s, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Sa˜o Paulo States of Brazil. This plant takes part in a genus comprising only nine species; two of them are vulnerable to extinction in Sa˜o Paulo State (Programa Biota FAPESP, 2007) and one species, S. delicata, has been recently described (Sobral and Proenc¸a, 2006). S. densiflora has been biologically and chemically researched by our group (Gallo et al., 2006a, b, c) since neither data about it could be found in the literature nor popu- lar use has been registered. Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae, formely Verbenaceae) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espı´rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro 0939Ð5075/2008/0500Ð0371 $ 06.00 ” 2008 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen · http://www.znaturforsch.com · D and Sa˜o Paulo, and is commonly called “Taruma˜”. Its leaf tea is used in folk medicine to treat kidney infections (Rodrigues, 2001; Gallo et al., 2008). Several of its compounds had already been charac- terized and bioassayed (Leita˜o et al., 1997; Leita˜o and Delle Monache, 1998; Santos et al., 2001; Men- sor et al., 2001), but none was regarded as neither potential trypanocidal nor enzyme inhibitor. Trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a compli- cated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoal agents. Trypanosomatids have no functional tricarbox- ylic acid cycle, and their bloodstream forms are highly dependent on glycolysis to the stage of pyr- uvate as sole energy supply. Trypanosome glycoly- Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM 372 M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants sis occurs in a specific microbody called glyco- some. Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy neces- sary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy- drogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of Trypanosoma cruzi catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphor- ylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bis- phosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD+ and in- organic phosphate. The in silico modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker et al., 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spermi- dine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb et al., 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the N1,N8-(bisglutathionyl)- spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S]2) to di- hydrotrypanothione (T[SH]2). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S]2) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against try- panosomatids (Hamilton et al., 2003). The genus Leishmania owns three enzymes in- volved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephos- phoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and α-d-5- phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into ad- enosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophos- phate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofura- nose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid se- quence when compared to corresponding mam- malian enzymes, which should allow the develop- ment of selective inhibitor compounds. In our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from T. cruzi or APRT enzyme from Leishmania tarentolae, were assessed. Materials and Methods Plant material Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae) and Sipho- neugena densiflora O.

Isolation of compounds 8 and 10 from a dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of stem of Siphoneugena densiflora (SD-DMS) A quantity of 1.62 g of SD-DMS was chroma- tographed over Sephadex-LH20 (28.0 ¥ 3.0 cm) using gradient elution from dichloromethane/hex- ane (50:50 by volume), dichloromethane (100%), methanol/dichloromethane (50:50 by volume) to methanol (100%). A total of 34 fractions of 20 mL each was collected and pooled into 10 fractions (DMS1 to DMS10). Fraction 5 (DMS5, 75.4 mg) was rechromatographed over Sephadex-LH20 (45.0 ¥ 2.0 cm) using methanol as eluent to afford 15 fractions of 20 mL each, which were combined into 5 fractions (DMS5m to DMS5q).

T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activity The enzymatic activity of T. cruzi gGAPDH and the inhibitory activities of extracts and compounds against this enzyme have been determined accord- Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 375 ing to an earlier reported procedure (Vieira et al., 2001). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), i.e., the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentra- tions, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC50 = 55.5 μm). L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activity APRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier de- scribed procedures (Thiemann et al., 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectro- photometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propane- diol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 μL APRT so- lution. The reaction started by the addition of en- zyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira et al., 2001). T. cruzi TR inhibitory activity Enzyme activity and assay were performed ac- cording to prior descriptions (Hamilton et al., 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as posi- tive control [IC50 = 2.72 μm (personal communica- tion, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC50 value was deter- mined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Im- perial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC50 values, and the results were fitted into the equation Y = {Range/[1 + (X/IC50)s]} + Background, where Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in μm), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1). T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assay Bloodstream forms of T. brucei, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% se- rum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of T. brucei was evaluated using the Alamar Blue“ assay (Räz et al., 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 μm. T. cruzi cytotoxicity assay The assay was carried out using blood infected with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi “Y” strain col- lected by cardiac puncture in experimentally in- fected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal mu- rine blood to 2 · 106 trypomastigotes/mL. The as- say was performed in triplicate on titration micro- plates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or com- pounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL and 100 μg/ mL. The plates were incubated at 4 ∞C, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC50 = 31 μg/mL or 76 μm) were run in parallel. The re- sults were expressed as percentage of lysis of try- pomastigote forms compared to the DMSO con- trol. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.

VP-HHL (53%) showed characteristic signals of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. VP-DHL (38%), when submitted to column chromatography, yielded a fraction containing a mixture of steroids which was responsible for 93% of Tc lysis at 500 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table). VP-EHL (36%) yielded compound 18 (31%), and VP-MHL (52%) afforded compounds 18 and 23 (16%). VP-DML, after fractionation, afforded com- pounds 16, 17, and a mixture of flavonoids con- taining quercetin 3-O--d-glucopyranoside and quercetin 4-O--d-glucopyranoside, which caused 97% Tc lysis at 500 μg/L. The same mixture inhib- ited the gGAPDH activity by 92% at 100 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table), which may explain the mechanism of action of the mixture on the trypomastigote forms of the para- site. 16 performed a better activity against T. cruzi (33%, Table II) in comparison with compound 14 (27%), indicating that O-methylation of the 3-hydroxy group was important to improve the activity. VP-BHAL showed a good trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi (60%, Table III), however, the compounds isolated from this fraction did not.

The outcomes from triterpenes 4 (Table I), 24, 25 and 26 (Table II) point out a clear correlation between increasing number of hydroxy groups and higher activity, which justifies a meticulous investi- gation on structure-activity relationships in this case. All the substances tested against T. brucei were inactive, perhaps because of the low concentration (100 μm) tested in contrast to the concentration tested on T. cruzi (500 μg/mL, see Tables I and II). gGAPDH inhibition On the whole, 26 extracts and subfractions were tested. Eleven of them, the most polar (SD-metha- nolic and hydroalcoholic extracts), showed out- comes above 70% (Table III), and the majority belonged to S. densiflora (SD). The ascription of such activities to the hydrolysable tannins 11, 12, 13, and ellagic acid (9) may be considered due to the low IC50 values accomplished by these com- pounds (Table I). Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 381 Among the flavonoids, the simple and highly oxidized flavonol quercetin (1) was the most ac- tive. The flavone luteolin (14), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduc- tion of the methoxy group at position C-3 (15) or C-3 (16), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested en- zymes (for comparison, see activities of com- pounds 17, 18 and 23 in Table II). The O-glycosyl- ated flavonol quercitrin (2) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone 1. Lio et al. (1985) ob- served the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activi- ties also performed by compounds 21 and 22 (Ta- ble II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I and II). An unseparated mix- ture of lupeol, α-amyrin and -amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from S. densiflora (SD-DML), tested at 200 μm, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentra- tion, a mixture of compound 24 and its isomer 2α,3-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound 24 inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II). APRT inhibition From 17 extracts and subfractions tested, eight presented results greater than 60%. Several could not be screened because they absorbed at the same wavelength used in the bioassay.

Furthermore, quercetin (1) as well as quercitrin (2), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD- EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had ac- tivities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I and II). When analyzing the results dis- played by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hy- droxy groups. Accordingly, compound 29, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to 28 and two in relation to 30, was twice more active than 28 and seven times more than 30 (Table II). TR inhibition All tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (11) and castalagin (12) which performed an IC50 value of 179.3 μm on enzyme inhibition, although this re- sult is not promising in comparison with clomi- pramine, the positive control.

In this context, endo- phytes belonging to the Penicillium genus have been recognized as a rich source of bioactive sec- ondary metabolites (Fill et al., 2007). Recent ex- amples include the anticancer berkelic acid from Penicillium sp., polyketides with HIV-integrase inhibitory activity from P. chrysogenum and the insecticidal paraherquamides H and I from P. clu- niae (Singh, 2003; Stierle et al., 2006). As part of our interest for bioactive metabo- lites from endophytes associated with Brazilian plants (Cafêu et al., 2005; Inácio et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2006; Teles et al., 2006), Alibertia macrophyl- la (Rubiaceae) was selected for our study, due to the fact that this species accumulates a series of bioactive compounds (Bolzani et al., 1991; Silva et al., 2007). Thus, the major aim of the current study was to identify potential bioactive compounds from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endo- phytes associated with A. macrophylla leaves, by using antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibi- tory assays. Material and Methods General 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the solvents as internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer in the ESI mode using MeOH/H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V).

Naturforsch. 64 c, 824 – 830 (2009); received June 29, 2009 In the course of our continuous search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi living in plants from the Brazilian ﬂ ora, leaves of Alibertia macrophylla (Rubiaceae) were submitted to isolation of endophytes, and two species of Penicillium were isolated. The ac- etonitrile fraction obtained in corn from a culture of Penicillium sp.1 afforded orcinol (1). On the other hand, Penicillium sp.1 cultivated in potato-dextrose-broth furnished two differ- ent compounds, cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val) (2) and uracil (3). The chromatographic fractionation of the acetonitrile fraction obtained from Penicillium sp.2 led to three dihydroisocoumarins, 4-hydroxymellein (4), 8-methoxymellein (5) and 5-hydroxymellein (6). Compounds 5 and 6 were obtained from the Penicillium genus for the ﬁ rst time. Additionally, metabolites 1 – 6 were evaluated for their antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. The most active compounds 1 and 4 exhibited detection limits of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 2 showed a detection limit of 10.0 μg, displaying potent AChE inhibitory activity.

Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde/H2SO4 reagent fol- lowed by heating at 120 ºC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 preparative column (250 mm × 21.2 mm). Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 instrument using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230 – 400 mesh (Merck). Plant material Authenticated Alibertia macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) was collected in Estação Ecológica Experimental de Mogi-Guaçu, Fazenda Campin- inha, Mogi-Guaçu, São Paulo, Brazil, in Novem- ber 2003. The botanical identiﬁ cation was made by Ph.D. Maria Cláudia Marx Young (Institute of Botany, São Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher speci- men was deposited at the Herbarium of the Bo- tanic Garden of São Paulo, Brazil (voucher no. SP 370915). Isolation and identiﬁ cation of the endophytes For isolation of the endophytic fungi, adult and healthy leaves of A. macrophylla were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were ﬁ rst washed with water and soap, and then im- mersed in an 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁ nally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. Sterilized leaves were cut into 2 × 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthramicine sulfate (50 mg/mL) with approx. 3 to 4 pieces on each dish (Silva et al., 2006). The endophytic fungi were identiﬁ ed according to the characteristics of morphology of the cul- ture and spores, mechanism of spore production, and molecular taxonomy according to a modi- ﬁ cation of the rapid preparation of DNA from ﬁ lamentous fungi (Raeder and Broda, 1985). The fungi were identiﬁ ed by Ph.D. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Plu- ridisciplinar de Pesquisas Químicas, Biológicas e Agrícolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in our collection with culture numbers 05070032-C and 05-070032-A for Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, respectively. Preparation of the crude extract in corn and potato-dextrose-broth of Penicillium sp.1 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cool, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d. After the incubation period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 × 250 mL); after that the solvent was evaporated, providing the crude MeOH extract (10.6 g). The methanol extract was dissolved in water and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was suspended in acetonitrile and parti- tioned with hexane. Evaporation of the organic phase resulted in the crude acetonitrile extract (804 mg). The fungus was cultivated using potato-dex- trose-broth (PDB) as culture medium (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/L H2O). For the PDB, 20 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) were used, each containing 100 mg of potato extract, 5.0 g dextrose and 250 mL distilled water, which were autoclaved at 125 °C for 15 min. Approx. 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of Penicillium sp.1 were inoc- ulated into each ﬂ ask, and the ﬂ asks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After in- cubation for 28 d at 25 °C on rotatory shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂ asks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁ ltration, and the ﬁ ltrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 × 2.5 L). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase under reduced pressure yielded a brown, solid residue (507 mg). Preparation of the crude extract in corn of Penicillium sp.2 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cooling, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d.

TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol), in order to wash them, and were thoroughly dried just before use. After migration of the sample in a suitable solvent (or direct deposition of sam- ple), the TLC plate was dried for complete re- moval of the solvent. The plate was then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and thoroughly dried again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was laid ﬂ at on plastic plugs in a plastic tank con- taining a little bit of water; by this means, water did not come directly into contact with the plate but the atmosphere was kept humid. The cover was placed on the tank and incubation was per- formed at 37 °C for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After in- cubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the 1-naph- thyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple colouration after 1 – 2 min. Galanthamine was employed as positive control (Marston et al., 2002). Results and Discussion The molecular structures of all isolates (Fig. 1) were conﬁ rmed by the MS and NMR data as shown below. Assignments were based on 2D- NMR experiments including gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC. Compound 1 was isolated as a brown amor- phous powder and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C7H8O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 123). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic signals, δH 5.99 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-6) and δH 6.01 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H, H-2 and H-4) suggesting a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o spectra showed ﬁ ve signals, assigned to one oxygenated aromatic groups at δC 158.1 (C-1 and C-5), two methines attributed to signals at δC 99.7 (C-6) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4) and one methyl group at δC 21.1 (C-7). The position of the methyl substituent at position C-3 was at- tributed on the basis on the gHMBC experiment, which indicates a correlation of δH 2.43 (H-7) with δC 138.9 (C-3) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4). This data suggests that 1 is orcinol (Monde, 1998). Compound 2 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H16N2O2 ([M+H]+ at m/z 197). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed signals at δH 0.86 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-11), δH 1.02 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12), δH 4.12 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-6), and δH 3.92 (brs, 1H, H-9). Also, three mul- tiplets at δH 3.40 (2H, H-3), 1.78 (2H, H-4), and 2.13 (2H, H-5) were observed. Analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum indicated two methyl groups, three methylene carbon atoms and three methine carbon atoms. The signals at δC 170.2 and δC 165.2 were attributed to two amide carbonyl groups at C-7 and C-1, respectively, and 1H NMR signals of an amino acid suggested that 2 belongs to the diketopiperazine class. The gHMBC cross-peaks between the signal for C-1 and the signals for H-3, H-6, H-9, and H-10, as well as the signal for C-7 and the signals for H-5, H-6, and H-9 conﬁ rmed that 2 was biosynthesized by condensation of the amino acids proline and valine. The interpretation of these results combined with comparison with literature data (Furtado et al., 2005) suggest that diketopiperazine 2 is cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val). Compound 3 was isolated as yellow amorphous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecu- lar formula C4H4N2O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 111). The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 appeared to be relatively simple, exhibiting two doublets at δH 5.41 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-5) and δH 7.38 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-6). The 13C NMR spectrum showed only four signals, for two carbonyl groups [δC 151.9 (C-2) and δC 164.4 (C-4)] and two methines [δC 99.9 (C- 5) and δC 142.9 (C-6)]. These data indicate that 3 is uracil (Schindler, 1998; Martin et al., 2007). Fig. 1. Chemical structures of compounds 1 – 6 isolated from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2.

Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecu- lar formula C10H10O4 ([M+Na]+ at m/z 217). The 1H NMR spectrum showed doublets for three ar- omatic protons at δH 6.86 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-5), δH 6.96 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-7) and δH 7.45 (dd, J = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, 1H, H-6). Altogether these signals suggest that 4 presented a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The gCOSY cross-peaks of the doublet at δH 1.51 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-9) coupled to a methine hydrogen atom with a signal at δH 4.63 (dq, J = 6.5, 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-3) in turn coupled to a methine hydrogen atom at δH 4.50 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-4), suggesting an α-methylhydroxy unit in the molec- ular structure of 4. The broad singlet at δH 11.0 (1H) indicated the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a hydroxy group (8-OH) and a carbonyl group (C-1). The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o spectra showed the presence of ten signals, assigned to one methyl [δC 16.0 (C-9)], ﬁ ve methine groups [δC 78.1 (C-3), δC 67.2 (C-4), δC 118.5 (C-5), δC 136.7 (C-6), δC 118.2 (C-7)], and three aromatic quaternary carbon atoms [δC 162.1 (C-8), δC 106.8 (C-8a), δC 140.5 (C-4a)], and one signal at δC 169.1 (C-1), which was attributed to a carbonyl group, suggesting that 4 is an dihydro- isocoumarin. This information coupled to data of the literature (Holler et al., 1999) assigne 4 to the structure of 4-hydroxymellein. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C11H12O3 ([M+H]+ at m/z 193). In particular, a high similarity between the NMR spectral data of compounds 5 and 4 was observed. The major difference was identiﬁ ed in the chemi- cal shifts attributed to H-4 of 5, which showed a multiplet at δH 2.80 (2H, H-4). Furthermore, the presence of a singlet at δH 3.88 (3H, H-10) sug- gested a methoxy substituent. A gHMBC correla- tion was observed between the signal at δC 161.2 (C-8) and H-10, which conﬁ rmed the position of the methoxy group at C-8. This information cou- pled to literature data (Kamisuki, 2007) assigne 5 to the structure of 8-methoxymellein. The dihydroisocoumarin 6 was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data in- dicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M–H]– at m/z 193). Considering differences in the NMR spectral data between compounds 5 and 6, the 1H NMR spectrum of 6 exhibited two ortho-coupled hydrogen atoms at δH 6.73 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-7) and δH 6.92 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-6), suggesting a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o data indicated signals at δC 156.5 and δC 143.0, which where attributed to the hydroxy- lated aromatic carbon atoms C-8 and C-5, respec- tively. These data indicate a hydroquinone ring in the molecular structure of 6, which was identiﬁ ed as 5-hydroxymellein (Harwood, 1984). Compounds 1 – 6 were evaluated for their an- tifungal activity against Cladosporium cladospo- rioides and C. sphaerospermum using a direct bioautography assay (Table I). The most active compounds, orcinol (1) and 4-hydroxymellein (4), showed a potent effect towards the yeasts, exhib- iting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, re- spectively. 5 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity to- wards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 μg, re- Table I.

Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes 829 spectively. 5-Hydroxymellein (6) proved to be not potent, since the content at which this compound showed activity was 50 μg. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydro- isocoumarins and free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8. The identiﬁ cation of the compounds 1, 4 and 5, potentially bioactive against the phytopatho- genic fungi, indicates that they act as defence of the host species against possible attacks of patho- gens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for compounds isolated from Penicillium, few stud- ies have been devoted to the acetylcholineste- rase (AChE) inhibitory activity. AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to terminate the impulse-transmitted action through cholinergic synapses (Stryer, 1995; Sigurdsson and Gudbjar- nason, 2007). Although the fundamental reason of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not clear so far, AD is ﬁ rmly associated with impairment in the cholinergic transmission. A number of AChE in- hibitors have been considered as candidates for the symptomatic treatment of AD as the most useful relieving strategy (Barbosa-Filho et al., 2006; Alarcón et al., 2008). The diketopiperazine 2 exhibited the highest AChE inhibitory activity displaying a detection limit of 10.0 μg (Table I). Compounds 1 and 3 showed a detection limit of 60 μg, which was considered as weakly potent. The dihydroisocoumarin 4 displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 30.0 μg. On the other hand, compounds 5 and 6 were not active (detection limits over 100 μg). Similar to the observed antifungal activ- ity, free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8 corrobo- rate to increase the anti-AChE potency presented by dihydroisocoumarins. In conclusion, six metabolites from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endophytes associ- ated with A. macrophylla leaves, exhibited poten- tial bioactivity, including antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results suggest that com- pounds 2 and 4 should be considered further in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for the use in the drug design for Alzheimer’s disease treatment.

Among the plant families studied, Meliaceae and Ruta- ceae are perhaps the most promising (Schoon- hoven, 1982), at least partly due to the presence of limonoids and triterpenoids characteristic of the Rutales order. The biological activity of limo- noids from Rutales has been reviewed (Cham- pagne et al., 1992). Some neem-based botanical insecticides have already been developed and marketed (Schmutterer, 1990, 1995, 2005). Carapa guianensis Aublet, also called andiroba, andiroba-saruva, iandirova, carapá, and nandiro- ba (Lorenzi and Matos, 2002), is a tall Meliaceae tree growing wild throughout South America, West India, and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in ﬂ ooded areas of the Ama- zon rainforest (Ambrozin et al., 2006). From the nuts of this plant an oil, called andiroba oil, is ex- tracted, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, as analgesic, anti-inﬂ ammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and as an anticancer remedy (Bickii et al., 2000; Gilbert et al., 1999; MacKinnon et al., 1997; Moura et al., 2002). Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, together with 2 – 5% of unsaponiﬁ able material. In addi- tion, from several parts of Carapa guianensis li- monoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, ﬂ avo- noids, and diglycerides have been isolated (Lavie et al., 1973; Marcelle and Moto, 1975; Ollis et al., 1964, 1970; Qi et al., 2003, 2004). Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae) (“canjarana”) is a native tree of economic impor- tance in Brazil. It is a dioecious tree with wide- spread distribution in the neotropics, extending from Costa Rica to southern Brazil and northern Argentina. According to Pennington et al. (1981), it inhabits mainly nonﬂ ooded evergreen lowland or lower hill rain forests. In the present paper, triterpenoids and limo- noids isolated from C. canjerana and C. guianensis were examined for their effects on the fall army- worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepi- doptera: Noctuidae). S. frugiperda is a major pest of many crops in the Americas and one of the most important pests of tropical maize, causing up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity of this crop in Brazil (Cruz et al., 1996).

The ethanolic extract (88.3 g) of the fruits was submitted to liquid-liquid partition with 120 ml methanol/water (3:1, v/v) solution. This solution was partitioned with dif- ferent solvents to give fractions in n-hexane (fr- Hex, 47.4 g), dichloromethane (fr-CH2Cl2, 5.4 g), ethyl acetate (fr-EtOAc, 4.4 g), and methanol (fr- MeOH, 11.9 g). The fraction fr-Hex (2.8 g) was submitted to a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 45 fractions of 50 ml) using n- hexane/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase, yielding nine fractions (fr-Hex.1 to fr-Hex.10) after TLC analysis.

The fraction fr-Hex.2.2 (88.6 mg) was rechromato- graphed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 3.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 10 fractions of 5 ml each) eluted with n-hexane/acetone (9:1, v/v) to afford ocotil- lone (1, 16.3 mg) and cabraleadiol (2, 24.4 mg). The ethanolic extract (14.3 g) of the seeds of C. canjerana was chromatographed on microcry- stalline cellulose-D and silica gel (column 5.0 x 22.0 cm i.d., fractions of 250 ml each) using n-hex- ane (250 ml) followed by dichloromethane (1 l), acetone (1 l), and methanol (1 l) as mobile phas- es yielding 13 fractions (EES-1 to EES-13). The fraction EES-2 (1.72 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 69 fractions of 10 ml each) using n-hexane/ acetone/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase to yield eleven fractions (EES-2.1 to EES- 2.11) which were joined based on TLC. The frac- tion EES-2.6 (293.4 mg) was rechromatographed by column chromatography using a Sephadex LH- 20 column (3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol), yielding ﬁ fteen fractions (EES-2.6.1 to EES-2.6.15). The fraction EES-2.6.7 afforded methyl angolensate (3, 48.2 mg). The fraction EES-2.7 (230.6 mg) was re- chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 35 fractions of 10 ml each), using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as mobile isocratic phase, yielding seventeen fractions (EES- 2.7.1 to EES-2.7.17). The fraction EES-2.7.9 af- forded 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide (4, 63.7 mg). The arillus ethanolic extract (10.0 g) of C. gui- anensis was submitted to vacuum chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase (70 – 230 mesh, column 30 x 5 cm i.d.) and n-hexane followed by CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH (1 l each) as mobile phases, yielding four fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (3.8 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica gel (230 – 400 mesh, 30 x 4 cm i.d., n-hexane and acetone gradient as elu- ent, starting with pure n-hexane and ﬁ nishing with pure acetone, 32 fractions of 200 ml each) to give ﬁ ve fractions (Ac1 to Ac5). The fraction Ac3 (3.0 g) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 10 x 3 cm i.d.) eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2 to MeOH, 28 frac- tions of 50 ml each) to yield ten fractions (Ac3.1 to Ac3.10). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5, 24.4 mg) and β-photogedunin (6, 14.4 mg) were isolated from fraction Ac3.2 by recycling HPLC (Asahipack polymeric column; eluent, methanol/ dichloromethane, 7:3, v/v; ﬂ ow, 4 ml min–1). Biological activity Larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Labora- tory of Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil, and reared on semi-artiﬁ cial diets (Kasten et al., 1978; Parra, 1986). They were maintained in an incubation chamber with a pho- toperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark, (70 5)% rela- tive humidity, and (25 1) °C. For each treatment and control, 30 neonate larvae of S. frugiperda were used. A solution of compound was added to ascorbic acid (1.56 g; an Unauthenticated Download Date | 9/2/15 2:05 PM A. L. F. Sarria et al. · Triterpenoids and Limonoids against Spodoptera frugiperda 247 ingredient of the diet). After evaporation of the solvent, the mixture was incorporated into the semi-artiﬁ cial diet in which bean and wheat germ are the basic ingredients (Kasten et al., 1978) at ﬁ nal contents of 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg kg–1 for 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), and 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg–1 for ocotillone (1), cabraleadiol (2), methyl angolensate (3), 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide (4), and β-photogedunin (6). The diet for the con- trol was prepared similarly but without the tri- terpenoids or limonoids. Gedunin (7) was used as positive control. The diets were placed in previously sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm × 2.5 cm), into which larvae of S. frugiperda were introduced individu- ally. The pupae were weighed 1 d after pupation and were transferred to plastics cups, where they stayed until the emergence of adults. Daily obser- vations were made and the following parameters were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal phases, (2) weight of pupae, and (3) percentage of dead insects (mortality) at the end of each phase. Statistics Data were submitted to an analysis of variance ANOVA (Zar, 1974), and the averages were com- pared applying the Tukey test (P 0.05). Each tube containing one insect, independent of the developed phase, was considered as one replicate, therefore, the number of replicates was different for each treatment. For evaluation of the mortal- ity of the larvae and pupae, the experimental unit was constituted by the mean of ﬁ ve tubes contain- ing one larva each, with six replications by treat- ment. Results and Discussion The triterpenoids 1 and 2 and limonoids 3 and 4 were isolated from the fruits and seeds of C. canjerana and the limonoids 5 and 6 from the aril- lus of C. guianensis (Fig. 1). Their structures were conﬁ rmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and comparison with data from the literature (Braga et al., 2006; Ambrozin et al., 2006). Compounds 1 – 6 were incorporated in the semi-artiﬁ cial diet. 2, 4, and 5 affected larval de- velopment (Table I), and only 6 affected pupal development at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg [(8.5 1.64) days and (8.9 1.25) days, respec- tively, control (10.1 1.45) days].

Larvae fed with semi-artiﬁ cial diet treated with 2, 4, and 5 at 50.0 mg kg–1 prolonged the larval time for approximately 1.2 days similar to gedun- in, suggesting that these compounds act as larval growth inhibitors (Table I). Compounds 2 and 4 prolonged the larval phase, although no alteration in pupal weight was ob- served. Tanzubil and McCaffery (1990) observed that larvae treated with low doses of azadirachtin produced pupae with a weight comparable to that of the controls, suggesting that they did not expe- rience any severe feeding inhibition. Compound 5 also effected prolongation of the larval phase followed by reduction of the pupal weight. The larvae treated with 5 showed prolonga- tion of the larval phase by 1.4 days (at 50.0 mg kg–1) and 2.6 days (at 100.0 mg kg–1) when compared with the control (14.9 days, Table I). The reduction of the pupal weight was by 17.8 and 25.8 mg at 50.0 and 100.0 mg kg–1, respectively, when compared with the control (262.5 mg, Table I). Larvae treated with 6 at 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg–1 presented reduction of the pupal weight by 30.0, 31.1, and 31.5 mg, respectively, when com- pared with the control (272.7 mg, Table I).

Ocotillone (1) isolated from the leaves of Dysoxylum malabaricum (Govindachari et al., 1994) was tested against Spodoptera litura and showed excellent PFI (percentage feeding in- dex) values comparable to those of azadiradione, epoxyazadiradione, and limonin (Govindachari et al., 1995). Methyl angolensate (3) exhibited insecticidal activity against S. litura in no-choice tests (Ab- delgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh et al., 2002; Powel et al., 1991), and this result agrees with that observed in the present work. Isolated from diethyl ether and acetone extracts of the stem bark of Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) 3 showed antifeedant activity by the conventional leaf disc method on the third-instar larvae of Spodop- tera littoralis (Boisd., Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at 500 μg ml–1 (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh et al., 2002) in a study examining struc- ture-insect antifeedant relationships of plants belonging to the Rutales order. In a dual-choice antifeedant bioassay against Spodoptera litura L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), methyl angolensate (3) showed a PFI of 65.3, near to that of cedrelone (51.5). Two limonoids (sandoricin and 6-hydroxy- sandoricin) isolated from seed extracts of Sando- ricum koetjape Merr. (Meliaceae), which possess chemical structures similar to that of methyl an- golensate (3), showed signiﬁ cant antifeedant ac- tivity against the fall armyworm (S. frugiperda), incorporated in diet at 25 ppm, and similar activ- ity against the European corn borer (ECB), Os- trinia nubilalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), at 200 ppm. Toxicity results for both insects indi- cated that continued feeding on diets containing sandoricin or 6-hydroxysandoricin at the 200 ppm level would result in nearly 100% mortality prior to pupation (Powell et al., 1991). β-Photogedunin (6) presented the highest in- secticidal activity against S. frugiperda causing mortality of 53.3% in the larval stage and 20.0% in the pupal phase at 50 ppm. These results agree with those of Céspedes et al. (2000), who tested an epimeric mixture of photogedunin and their corresponding acetates and observed that these compounds caused signiﬁ cant mortality of S. fru- giperda larvae (45% to 100% at 10.0 to 52.0 ppm) after 7 days, as well as growth reduction, and pho- togedunin acetates showed the highest insecticid- al activity at 10.0 ppm with 17% survival. Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 6 showed moderate in- secticidal activity at 50.0 mg kg-1 with 40.0, 40.0, 33.3, and 53.3% mortality, respectively, for the lar- val phase. Although the compounds tested here were less active than the positive the control ge- dunin (7, 63.3%), the use of these compounds, in particular 6, is suggested for the control of S. frugiperda. Comparison of the activities of 6 and 7 suggests that oxidation of the furan ring led to a decrease in the insecticidal activity.

(RUBIACEAE). The present communication reports the isolation and identification of four triterpenoid saponins from the chloroform extract of the leaves of Tocoyena brasiliensis: 3-O-β-D- quinovopyranosyl quinovic acid, 3-O-β-D-quinovopyranosyl cincholic acid, 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl quinovic acid and the 28- O-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester derivative of quinovic acid as binary mixtures, respectively. From the ethanol extract a flavonoid identified as ramnazin-3-O-rutinoside was obtained. The structures of these compounds were assigned by data analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectrometry and comparison with data recorded in the literature for these compounds. Keywords: Tocoyena brasiliensis; saponins; antifungal. INTRODUÇÃO O gênero Tocoyena (Rubiaceae), com cerca de 30 espécies, ocorre nas regiões pan e neotropical1. São espécies típicas do Cer- rado, sendo encontradas preferencialmente no Cerrado stricto sen- so, mas também ocorrem em florestas com clima quente e úmido, como a Floresta Amazônica2. Todos os representantes de Tocoyena são árvores de pequeno porte ou arbustos. Este gênero pertence à subfamília Ixoroideae, tribo Gardenieae-Gardeniineae, sendo os iridóides considerados seu principal marcador quimiotaxonômico3. Investigações fitoquímicas previamente realizadas por nosso gru- po sobre Rubiaceae, em particular T. formosa, conduziu ao isola- mento de iridóides glicosilados e não glicosilados, uma saponina triterpênica derivada do ácido quinóvico e um flavanol glicosilado4,5. Além de iridóides, a subfamília é conhecida por metabolizar flavonóides, triterpenos, derivados fenólicos e alcalóides do tipo emetínicos, quinolínicos e poliindolenínicos1. Tocoyena brasiliensis Mart., conhecida popularmente como genipapinho6, não apresenta registro de trabalhos sobre sua compo- sição química. Ensaios preliminares, objetivando a detecção de subs- tâncias com atividade antifúngica, indicaram para o extrato cloro- fórmico das folhas desta espécie atividade fraca contra o fungo filamentoso Cladosporium cladosporioides. O presente trabalho des- creve o isolamento e identificação de duas misturas binárias de saponinas triterpênicas e um flavonóide glicosilado. As misturas das saponinas 1+2 e 3+4 apresentaram atividade moderada contra o fun- go C. cladosporioides. As estruturas das substâncias foram estabe- lecidas com base na análise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo fitoquímico das folhas de T. brasiliensis resultou na separação de duas misturas binárias de saponinas triterpênicas, a primeira contendo o ácido 3-O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-quinóvico7 (1) e o ácido-3-O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-cinchólico (2) e a se- gunda, o ácido 3-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo-quinóvico8 (3) e o ácido 28-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo quinóvico9 (4). A saponina identificada como o ácido 3-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo-quinóvico8 (3) e o flavonóide ramanzina-3-O-rutinosídeo10 (5) também foram isola- dos como substâncias puras neste estudo. As estruturas dos compostos isolados foram caracterizadas a partir da análise dos dados espectroscópicos (RMN de 1H e 13C, DEPT 135, COSY 1H-1H, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY 1D) e por comparação com os dados disponíveis na literatura. As quatro saponinas triterpênicas isoladas apresentaram como padrão comum os C-27 e C-28 oxidados como grupo carboxílico. A ocorrência do grupo carboxila no C-27 foi evidenciada princi- palmente pela diferença ∆δ no C-14 de aproximadamente + 13,0 ppm, quando comparado com a α-amirina (C-14 ≈ δ 42,0)11. A diferença de deslocamento químico deste carbono é decorrente do efeito α da carboxila (C-27) em C-14. Assim, os esqueletos triterpênicos das saponinas isoladas foram identificados como de- rivados do ácido quinóvico12 ou do ácido cinchólico12, bastante dis- cutidos e analisados na literatura. A ocorrência da mistura binária das saponinas 1+2 foi eviden- ciada no espectro de RMN de 1H pelos sinais em δ 5,49 (m) e 602 Quim. Nova Hamerski et al. 5,45 (m) atribuídos aos átomos de hidrogênio olefínicos (H-12). O espectro de RMN de 13C mostrou sinais para dois esqueletos triterpênicos, sendo estes sinais análogos aos observados para áci- do quinóvico12 e ácido cinchólico12. No espectro de RMN de 13C foram observados os sinais em δ 128,1 (C-12), 132,8 (C-13), 55,5 (C-14), 53,8 (C-18), 38,6 (C-19), 36,2 (C-20), 176,9 (C-27), 178,8 (C-28), 18,2 (C-29) e 21,2 (C-30), que caracterizaram o esqueleto triterpênico do ácido quinóvico. Para o ácido cinchólico foram observados no espectro de RMN de 13C os sinais em δ 125,1 (C-12), 136,8 (C-13), 55,4 (C-14), 43,2 (C-18), 43,0 (C-19), 30,5 (C-20), 176,4 (C-27), 178,6 (C-28), 33,2 (C-29) e 23,5 (C-30) (Ta- bela 1). No espectro de RMN de 1H pode-se identificar a presença de dois monossacarídeos por meio de seus átomos de hidrogênio anoméricos em δ 4,13 (d, J = 7,5) e 4,12 (d, J = 7,9), que foram correlacionados no mapa de contorno gHMQC aos átomos de car- bono anoméricos em δ 105,2 e 105,3, respectivamente. A presença de metila em δ 1,10 (d, J = 6,0) no espectro de RMN de 1H e δ 18,1 no espectro de RMN de 13C sugeriu a presença de uma unidade de raminose, porém os valores dos deslocamentos químicos para os átomos de carbono não eram compatíveis aos observados para esse açúcar. No espectro de experimento COSY 1H-1H foram observa- das as correlações entre os hidrogênios carbinólicos, que foram atribuídas inequivocamente aos seus respectivos carbonos pelo es- pectro de experimento gHMQC. As constantes de acoplamento observadas para os H-1’ (J = 7,5), H-2’ (J = 9,0), H-3’ (J = 9,0) e H-4’ (J = 9,0) para ambas as unidades do açúcar indicaram a dispo- sição diaxial dos átomos de hidrogênio do carboidrato (Tabela 2). Adicionalmente, o espectro de gHMBC apresentou correlações entre o H-6’ (δ 1,10 d, J = 6,0) com os C-5’ (δ 75,5) e C-4’ (δ 71,3); o H- 2’ (δ 2,94 m) com o C-1’(δ 105,2). A associação destes dados ali- ados aos obtidos da literatura permitiram identificar a unidade de açúcar como a β-D-quinovose. A posição da unidade do açúcar no C-3 foi determinada pela correlação a longa distância, observada no mapa de contorno gHMBC entre o H-1’ e o C-3 (δ 88,1). Após análise dos espectros de RMN e comparação com os dados da lite- ratura foi possível identificar a substância 1 como ácido 3-O-β-D- quinovopiranosídeo-quinóvico7 e a substância 2 como o ácido-3- O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-cinchólico, inédita na literatura. O espectro de RMN de 13C da substância 3 apresentou sinais que revelaram a presença de uma saponina. Foram observados no espectro de RMN de 13C os sinais em δ 128,0, 132,5, 55,3, 176,3, 178,6 atribuidos aos C-12, C-13, C-14, C-27 e C-28, respectiva- mente, do esqueleto triterpênico. Além do sinal de carbono anomérico em δ 105,6 (C-1’), outros sinais referentes a uma uni- dade glicosídica foram observados. Os deslocamentos químicos destes e dos demais carbonos, com suas respectivas multiplicidades, apresentaram valores concordantes com os da literatura para o áci- do 3-O-β-D-glucopiranosídeo-quinóvico8 (3) (Tabela 1). O espectro de RMN de 13C da mistura 3 + 4 apresentou sinais que indicaram se tratar de uma mistura binária de saponinas triterpênicas. Após identificação dos sinais atribuídos para a subs- tância 3 no espectro de RMN de 13C, observaram-se os sinais para um segundo ácido quinóvico12, caracterizado principalmente pelos sinais duplicados em δ 55,3 e 56,2; 53,7 e 53,8 atribuídos aos C-14 (3), C-14 (4), C-18 (3) e C-18 (4), respectivamente. A diferença entre as duas substâncias foi evidenciada pelos valores dos deslo- camentos químicos dos átomos de carbono das unidades de açúca- res. O valor do deslocamento químico do C-1’ (substância 4) em δ 94,0 é observado quando a glicose está ligada ao C-28, conseqüên- cia do efeito de blindagem da carboxila (Tabela 1). O espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D obtido pela irradiação no H-1’ (δ 4,13, d, J = 7,5) da glicose exibiu correlações com os sinais em δ 2,93, 3,02, 3,05 e 3,10 atribuídos respectivamente aos H-2’, H-4’, H-5’ e H-3’ da unidade glicosídica ligada ao C-3, da substância 3. A irra- diação no H-1’ (δ 5,21, d, J = 7,9) gerou um espectro de experi- mento TOCSY 1D onde foram observadas as correlações com os sinais em δ 2,89, 2,99 e 3,12, atribuídos aos H-4’, H-2’ e H-3’, respectivamente, pertencentes à glicose ligada ao C-28 da substân- cia 4. Os dados obtidos com o espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D aliados aos espectros de gHMQC e gHMBC auxiliaram na atribui- ção inequívoca das unidades de glicose. A análise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D e comparação com os descritos na literatura permi- tiram identificar a substância 4 como ácido 28-O-β-D-glucopira- nosídeo quinóvico9. O flavonóide ramanzina-3-O-rutinosídeo (5) foi identificado pela comparação de seus dados espectroscópicos de RMN de 1H e 13C com os registrados na literatura10. A posição da unidade de β- D-glicose no C-3 foi confirmada pela correlação observada no es- pectro de gHMBC entre o H-1” (δ 5,38, d, J = 8,0) e o C-3 (δ 133,5). A posição da metoxila no C-3’ do anel B do flavonóide foi confirmada pela correlação observada entre os átomos de hidrogê- nio da metoxila (δ 3,83, s) e o C-3’ (δ 147,0). A atividade antifúngica detectada na fase clorofórmica das fo- lhas de T. brasiliensis contra o fungo fitopatogênico C. cladosporioides pode ser atribuída à presença de saponinas Tabela 1.

As substâncias isoladas e identificadas foram submeti- das a novos ensaios antifúngicos, utilizando a técnica da bioauto- grafia13, para se determinar os limites de detecção (quantidade míni- ma da amostra, em µg, necessária para inibir o crescimento do fun- go), sendo utilizados os fungos filamentosos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum (Tabela 3). As misturas (1 + 2) e (3 + 4) apresenta- ram atividade moderada (5 µg/mL) contra C. cladosporioides em comparação com o padrão nistatina (0,5 µg/mL) e não inibiram o crescimento de C. sphaerospermum. Não foi observada atividade antifúngica para a substância 3, este resultado é um indício de que a atividade antifúngica observada para a mistura das saponinas 3 + 4 pode ser atribuída para a saponina 4. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em DMSO-d6, no espectrômetro Bruker AC-200 F e Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrão de referência. Os experimentos TOCSY, COSY, gHMBC e gHMQC foram realizados em espectrômetro Varian Inova 500 e DEPT 135o em espectrômetro Bruker AC-200 F. Os espec- tros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa resolução FISION Modelo VG Platfform II, no modo Eletrospray. Os espectros no IR foram registrados em espectrofo- tômetro Perkin-Elmer 1600 (Series FTIR), em células de KBr. Os espectros no UV foram registrados em espectrofotômetro Perkin- Elmer Lambda 14P UV/VIS. Nas análises por CCDC e CCDP fo- ram utilizadas placas de sílica gel 60 G F254. As placas foram observadas sob luz UV 254-366 nm (Chromatovus) e reveladas com vapores de iodo ressublimado e solução de anisaldeído, segui- da de aquecimento. Nas cromatografias em coluna foram utiliza- das como fase estacionária sílica gel (230-400 mesh), sílica quimi- camente modificada com grupos octadecila (ODS) (Merk) e Sephadex LH-20. Material vegetal As folhas de T. brasiliensis foram coletadas na Estação Ecoló- gica de Itirapina, Itirapina – SP em janeiro de 2000. Uma exsicata encontra-se depositada no Herbário do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente de São Paulo. Extração e isolamento dos constituintes As folhas de T. brasiliensis (2.400 g) foram secas, moídas e submetidas à extração através de maceração com EtOH/H2O (8:2). O extrato EtOH/H2O foi concentrado sobre pressão reduzida ob- tendo-se 210,0 g de extrato bruto, sendo 130,0 g submetidos à par- tição utilizando n-BuOH/H2O (1:1). A fase n-BuOH foi concentra- da à pressão reduzida, novamente solubilizada em MeOH/H2O (9:1) e, em seguida, submetida à partição com hexano (48,3 g), clorofór- mio (11,2 g) e acetato de etila (11,2 g). Uma fração da fase CHCl3 (4,9 g) das folhas foi submetida à cromatografia líquida a vácuo utilizando sílica gel como fase esta- cionária, eluída em gradiente de polaridade [Hex; Hex/CH2Cl2 (8:2) → (4:6); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (95:5) → (6:4); MeOH], da qual foram coletadas 18 frações (70 mL cada). A fração 11 (1,09 g) foi fracionada em coluna de sílica gel eluída com CH2Cl2 /MeOH (9:1), obtendo-se a mistura das saponinas 1+2 (32,4 mg) e a substância 3 (27,0 mg). A subfração 11-B (176,6 mg), oriunda da fração 11, foi submetida a fracionamento em coluna de sílica gel, eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH (8:2), obtendo a mistura das saponinas 3+4 (20,8 mg). O extrato etanólico das folhas (10,0 g) foi solubilizado em EtOH/H2O (6:4) e submetido à cromatografia líquida a vácuo utili- zando sílica de fase modificada (C-18) como fase estacionária e eluída em gradiente de polaridade [MeOH/H2O (2:8) → (6:4), MeOH, CH2Cl2] sendo obtidas 8 frações (100 mL cada). A fração 6 foi submetida a fracionamento em Sephadex LH-20, eluída com MeOH, obtendo-se o flavonóide glicosilado 5 (32,5 mg). Ácido 3-O-β-D-quinovopiranosídeo-quinóvico (1) Sólido amorfo branco.

The phytochemical investigation of trypanocidal extracts from leaves and stems of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani (Rutaceae) afforded new pyranoflavones along with the known compounds flavone, 7-methoxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, haplotusine, 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone alkaloid, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosteryl benzoate. Their structures were established based on their spectral data. NMR data for the alkaloid haplotusine and the new pyranoflavones are described for the first time herein. These compounds were assayed on the tripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Among them, haplotusine and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone showed moderate values of IC50 136.9 and 144.9 µM, respectively. Keywords: Conchocarpus heterophyllus; trypanocidal activity; pyranoflavones. INTRODUÇÃO A doença de Chagas, causada pelo protozoário Trypanosoma cruzi, é uma das mais graves endemias do Brasil. No Continente Americano, ela afeta 16-18 milhões de indivíduos, sendo que 100 milhões estão sob risco de contaminação.1 Devido à ampla distribuição geográfica desta doença, à falta de tratamento eficaz e seguro, e às graves manifestações clínicas que ocasiona, a procura de novas substâncias para a profilaxia e/ou tratamento desta endemia se faz necessária. Neste contexto, as plantas são valiosas fontes de novos com- postos ativos e com baixa toxicidade.2 De fato, segundo um levan- tamento recente, 61% dos 877 novos fármacos desenvolvidos du- rante o período de 1981-2002 são produtos naturais, ou substân- cias desenvolvidas a partir deles.3 De plantas da família Rutaceae foram isolados alcalóides e lignanas com atividades tripanocidas.4,5 Além disso, as atividades sobre o T. cruzi ou sobre sua enzima GAPDH (gliceraldeído 3- fosfatodesidrogenase) de vários extratos e algumas substâncias iso- ladas desta mesma família foram determinadas.6-8 A espécie Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) pertence à família Rutaceae (ordem Rutales) e era anteriormente denominada de Angostura heterophylla (A. St.-Hil.) Alb.9 Nenhum estudo fitoquímico sobre o gênero é descrito na literatura. Entretanto, do gênero Angostura foram isolados alcalóides acridônicos.10 Os extratos e as frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus apresentaram atividade sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 Neste trabalho são descritos o isolamento, as atividades tripanocidas das substâncias obtidas de tais extratos/frações, assim como os dados de RMN do alcalóide haplotusina (1) e das piranoflavonas inéditas (2). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus, ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi, permitiu o isolamento de esteróides, flavonas e alcalóides 2- e 4- quinolônicos. A partir do extrato hexânico do caule de C. heterophyllus foram isolados os esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol;11 da fração diclorometânica proveniente do extrato hexânico das folhas, o benzoato de β-sitosterila12 e uma mistura de piranoflavonas inéditas (2); da fração acetato de etila deste mesmo extrato, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona13 e 5-hidroxiflavona;14 e da fra- ção acetato de etila do extrato metanólico do caule, flavona, 7- metoxiflavona, haplotusina (1)15 e o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4- quinolona (3).16 Todas as substâncias foram identificadas através da análise dos seus dados espectroscópicos e comparação com os da literatura. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) está sendo descrita pela primeira vez Figura 1.

Entretanto, os dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) não estavam descritos.15 No espectro de RMN 1H do alcalóide 1 foram observados quatro sinais relativos a hidrogênios aromáticos [8,00 (dl, J = 8,0 Hz), 7,73 (m), 7,68 (m) e 7,34 δ (ddd, J = 8,0, 6,4 e 1,6 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a presença de um anel aromático orto- dissubstituído na substância 1. Adicionalmente, um singleto em 6,08 δ, integrado para um hidrogênio, revelou a identidade dessa substân- cia como um alcalóide 4-R-2-quinolônico, que é de ocorrência bas- tante ampla em plantas da família Rutaceae.17 Entretanto, apesar do alcalóide 1 ser do tipo 4-R-2-quinolônico, apresenta a ligação N- OCH3, que é bastante incomum. A presença desse grupo foi deduzida a partir do sinal em 63,73 δ no espectro de RMN 13C. As atribuições dos dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) (Tabela 1) foram realizadas através da análise dos mapas de contorno de HSQC e HMBC. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) foi identificada através de EM e RMN, em uma e duas dimensões. Seu espectro de RMN 1H apre- sentou sinais relativos a oito hidrogênios aromáticos [8,23 (dd, J = 7,9 e 1,6 Hz), 7,84 (dd, J = 7,8 e 1,6 Hz), 7,69 (ddd, J = 8,4, 7,2 e 1,6 Hz), 7,55 (dl, J = 8,4 Hz), 7,42 (m), 7,40 (m), 7,07 (ddd, J = 7,8, 7,8 e 0,9 Hz) e 6,98 δ (dl, J = 8,2 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a existência de dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Este fato foi confirmado pela análise do espectro de COSY 1H-1H. O espectro de RMN 1H apresentou ainda um sinal em 5,69 δ (1H, dd, J = 9,5 e 3,4 Hz) e vários sinais na região mais blindada [1,85 e 1,70 (m), 1,25 e 0,88 δ (t)]. Observou-se também que os hidrogênios em 1,85 e 1,70 δ acoplavam entre si e com o hidrogê- nio em 5,69 δ (dd). O mapa de contorno de HSQC permitiu a deter- minação dos deslocamentos químicos dos carbonos (Tabela 2) li- gados aos hidrogênios descritos anteriormente. Os experimentos de RMN 13C indicaram, excetuando-se a região mais blindada, a existência de 8 CH aromáticos e 7 carbonos quaternários, o que sugeriu a natureza de 2 como um flavonóide, mais especificamente como uma flavona. Além disso, definiu-se que tal flavona deveria ser substituída em 3, já que não existia o sinal de H-3 (geralmente em 6,8 δ) e em 2', pois só existiam dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Por conseqüência, foi determinado que entre os anéis B e C da flavona havia ocorrido ciclização, com formação de um anel pirano. Este tipo de ciclização é observada em flavonóides prenilados.18 Entretanto, nunca foi descrita na literatura a ocorrência de ciclização de uma flavona para uma piranoflavona através de uma cadeia policetídica, como é o caso de 2. A presença do anel pirano foi confirmada através das correlações (2J e 3J) de H-11 (5,69 δ) com C-2 (155,95 δ) e C-3 (114,45 δ). Vale ressaltar, que os carbonos quaternários em 155,95; 155,69 e 154,71 δ, por serem coincidentes na projeção do mapa de contorno de HMBC, foram atribuídos (Tabela 2) por comparação com a 2'-metoxiflavona.13 O carbono carbonílico em 174,85 δ foi determinado como C-4 através de sua correlação (3J) com H-5 (8,23 δ). A espectrometria de massas com ionização por electrospray no modo positivo permitiu que fossem identificadas algumas das piranoflavonas presentes na mistura 2. Através desta técnica analí- tica, determinou-se o tamanho e as insaturações presentes na ca- deia alquílica das diferentes piranoflavonas que constituíam a mis- tura (Tabela 3). Entretanto, a posição da dupla ligação não pode ser determinada. Portanto, a mistura 2 é constituída por piranoflavonas inéditas que se distinguem no tamanho e nas insaturações da ca- deia alquílica (R). As substâncias isoladas foram testadas sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi nas concentrações de 500, 250 e 100 µg/ mL e os valores de IC50 foram calculados a partir dos valores de porcentagem de lise parasitária (% L.P.) obtidos nessas concentra- Tabela 3.

Os resultados (Tabela 4) mostram que dentre as substâncias testadas, as mais ativas foram os alcalóides 1 e 3, apresentando valo- res de IC50 de 136,9 e 144,9 µM, respectivamente. Entretanto, as substâncias testadas não mostraram ser potentes agentes tripanocidas, principalmente quando comparadas ao quimio-profilático violeta de genciana, cujo IC50 é de 83 µM, e com a lignana (-)-metilpluviatolídeo, que na concentração de 67,5 µM ocasionou 99% de lise parasitária.4 Apesar deste fato, os resultados dos testes tripanocidas sugeri- ram que as substâncias isoladas podem ser os princípios ativos das frações e extratos de C. heterophyllus, que foram ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Materiais e equipamentos Os espectros de RMN 1H, 13C e dos experimentos 2D foram obtidos em espectrômetros DRX-200 e ARX-400 da Bruker. Fo- ram utilizados CDCl3 ou CD3OD como solventes e tetrametilsilano (TMS) como padrão interno. O espectro de massas foi obtido por injeção direta em um equi- pamento Micromass Quattro LC, utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações A obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus estão descritos em Ambrozin et al.6 Isolamento das substâncias A mistura dos esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol foi obtida do extrato AHCH. Este extrato foi inicialmente submetido à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 4,7 x 23,9 cm), utilizan- do-se sílica gel (230-400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH], originando 8 frações. Da quarta fração (AHCH4; 521,3 mg) foi obtida a mistura de esteróides (120,6 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 3,8 x 29,3 cm) de sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH]. A fração AHFHD (2,0 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 4,1 x 44,8 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hex:CH2Cl2→MeOH], originando 7 frações. A quarta fração (AHFHD4; 309,1 mg) foi cromatografada em sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,0 x 47,0 cm) e eluída com MeOH, dando origem a 5 frações. A quinta fração (AHFHD4,5; 5,9 mg) foi identificada como o benzoato de β-sitosterila. A fração AHFHD5 (375,6 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna e à cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa. Tais técnicas per- mitiram a obtenção de 2,8 mg da mistura de piranoflavonas 2. Da fração AHFHA foram obtidas a flavona e a 7-metoxiflavona, segundo procedimento descrito em Ambrozin et al.6 Desta fração também foi isolada a 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHFHA (7,5 g) foi inicialmente submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 8,0 x 5,9 cm), utilizando-se florisil como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (hexano→MeOH), obtendo-se 6 frações. A fra- ção 3 (AHFHA3; 1,6 g) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel (230-400 mesh) (φ x h = 3,9 x 25,2 cm), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (9:1) → MeOH), dando origem a seis frações. A sexta fração (AHFHA3,6; 31,4 mg) foi recromatografada em coluna de sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,2 x 49,2 cm) e eluída com MeOH, originando 6 frações, das quais a sexta (AHFHA3,6,5; 5,2 mg) foi identificada como 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHCMA (2,4 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 3,2 x 53,0 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (CH2Cl2:MeOH (9,5:0,5) → MeOH), para dar origem a 4 frações. A primeira fração (AHCMA1; 872,0 mg) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (7:3) → MeOH), obtendo-se 8 frações. Da quarta fra- ção (AHCMA1,4; 15,5 mg) foi isolada a haplotusina (1) (5,3 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição isocrática (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Da oitava fração (AHCMA1,8; 129,2 mg) foi isolado o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4-quinolona (3) (22,1 mg), por cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Ensaio tripanocida Os ensaios com as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi foram realizados no Departamento de Análises Clínicas, Bromatológicas e Toxicológicas da FCFRP-USP, segundo procedimento descrito em Vieira et al.7 Para os ensaios foram utilizadas cepas “Y” de T. cruzi, que são mantidas através de passagens seriadas em camundongos, por meio de repiques semanais, no Laboratório de Parasitologia do Departa- mento de Ciências da Saúde da FCFRP-USP. Os ensaios biológicos das substâncias foram realizados utili- zando-se sangue de camundongos albinos Swiss, infectados pela cepa “Y” do T. cruzi, o qual foi obtido por punção cardíaca no pico da parasitemia (sétimo dia). Esse sangue foi diluído em sangue de animal sadio, de forma a se obter uma concentração final de 2x106 formas tripomastigotas por mL de sangue. Os ensaios foram reali- zados em microplacas de titulação (96 poços), onde o sangue infectado e as misturas (ou substâncias) a serem avaliadas foram solubilizados (em triplicata), e o material foi incubado por 24 h a 4 oC. Após este tempo, a contagem das formas tripomastigotas foi Tabela 4. Atividade tripanocida das substâncias isoladas de C. heterophyllus substância Concentração %L.P.

The phytochemical investigation of the flowers of Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae) resulted in the isolation and identification of nine phenolic derivatives, quercetin 3-O-sophoroside, taxifolin, astilbin, ourateacatechin, caffeic, ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic and gallic acid, besides two guanidine alkaloids, pterogynine, pterogynidine. This is the first time these compounds have been reported in P. nitens flowers. As this is a monospecific genus, these secondary metabolites may have taxonomical significance.

INTRODUÇÃO Pterogyne nitens Tulasne (Fabaceae – Caesalpinioideae), uma espécie pertencente a um gênero monoespecífico, é popularmente conhecida como “amendoim-do-campo”, “amendoim-bravo”, “bál- samo”, “yvi-raró”, “cocal”, “tipa” etc. Na América Latina essa espécie arbórea ocorre na Argentina, Bolívia, Paraguai e Brasil. No território brasileiro ocorre com freqüência na região de Mata Atlântica e Cerrado compreendida entre o Ceará até o Paraná.1 “Amendoim-bravo”, como é popularmente conhecida no esta- do de São Paulo, é amplamente empregada na construção civil de- vido às características da sua madeira moderadamente densa e re- sistente.2 P. nitens também conhecida pela beleza e odor de suas flores, bem como pela intensidade de suas folhagens e frutificação possui grande valor ornamental sendo, portanto, recomendada para arborização de vias urbanas e rodovias e na reposição de mata ciliar em locais com inundações periódicas. Esta espécie habita os re- manescentes de vegetação paulista e encontra-se sob risco de extinção, fazendo parte da lista de espécies recomendadas para a conservação genética no estado de São Paulo.3 A literatura apresenta poucos dados das aplicações medicinais e da constituição química de P. nitens. Estudos etnofarmacológicos em comunidades guaranis do nordeste da Argentina revelam o uso das cascas do caule no tratamento de infestações parasitárias, prin- cipalmente no combate ao “tacho”, nome popular de Ascaris lumbricoides.4 Em trabalhos fitoquímicos anteriores, foram isola- dos cinco alcalóides guanidínicos das folhas e caules de P. nitens, os quais mostraram atividade citotóxica sobre linhagens mutantes de Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sugerindo atividade antitumoral po- tencial desses alcalóides.5 Dada a emergência de preservação da espécie ameaçada de extinção, o estudo sobre a composição micromolecular das flores de P. nitens foi bastante significativo para o registro do perfil meta- bólico da espécie. Desse estudo foram isolados e identificados onze constituintes: quatro flavonóides, quatro derivados do ácido cinâmico, dois alcalóides guanidínicos e o ácido gálico. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A identificação de todas as substâncias foi realizada com base na comparação de dados espectroscópicos de RMN de 1H, RMN de 13C, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY 1D e comparação desses dados com aqueles disponíveis na literatura. A análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracte- rizar as substâncias 1-4 como derivados do ácido cinâmico, com uma feição comum caracterizada por um par de dubletos entre δH 7,58-7,49 (J= 16,0 Hz; 1H) e δH 6,40-6,13 (J= 16,0 Hz; 1H), típi- cos do sistema trans-alceno de derivados aromáticos C6-C3. Os de- mais valores atribuídos aos sinais correspondentes ao anel aromá- tico demonstram sutis diferenças na série 1-4. Os sinais em δH 7,12 (d, J= 2,5 Hz), δH 7,04 (dd, J= 2,5 e 8,5 Hz) e δH 6,85 (d, J= 8,5 Hz) observados no espectro de RMN de 1H de 1 foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2, H-6 e H-5, respectivamente. Esses dados suge- rem a presença de um anel aromático 1,3,4-trissubstituído, permi- tindo concluir que o derivado de ácido cinâmico em análise é o ácido cafeico.6 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C da substância 2 apresentaram o mesmo perfil de sinais daqueles observados para 1, exceto pela presença do singleto em δH 3,90 (3H), atribuído a uma metoxila. A 803 Constituintes químicos das flores de Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae)# Vol. 31, No. 4 ligação do grupo metoxílico ao anel aromático foi estabelecida pela correlação observada entre os sinais em δH 3,90 (OCH3) e 147,9 (C-3), no mapa de contornos gHMBC. Assim, a substância 2 pôde ser caracterizada como sendo ácido ferúlico.7 Os espectros de RMN de 1H da substância 3 apresentaram dois singletos δH 6,98 (2H) e δH 3,80 (6H), os quais foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios metínicos H-2 e H-6 e aos dois grupos metoxílicos, respectivamente. Os de- mais dados espectrais confirmaram a posição dos dois grupos metoxílicos nos carbonos C-3 e C-5 e permitiram identificar a es- trutura molecular de 3 como sendo ácido sinápico.8 Os dados dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 4 foram quase similares àqueles observados para o ácido cafeico 1. Na estrutura de 4, além dos sinais de uma unidade de ácido cafeico analisados a partir dos es- pectros de RMN de 13C, foram diagnosticados um conjunto de si- nais compatíveis com uma unidade de ácido quínico. O espectro de RMN de 1H apresentou sinais para três hidrogênios metínicos em δH 3,56 (dd, J= 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-4), 3,92 (d, J= 3,5 Hz, H-4) e 5,06 (td, J= 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-5) e para hidrogênios metilênicos na região compreendida entre δH 1,08 e 1,99 (H-2 e H-6), os quais confirmaram a presença de uma unidade derivada do ácido quínico. A ligação do grupo cafeoíla à unidade de ácido quínico foi estabelecida pela correlação observada entre os sinais em δH 5,06 (H-5) e δC 165,7 (C-9’), no mapa de contornos gHMBC. Os valores observados para os acoplamentos de H-4 com H-3 e H-5 indicaram uma relação axial-equatorial entre H-4 e H-3 (J= 3,5 Hz) e axial- axial entre H-4 e H-5 (J = 10,0 Hz) confirmando as posições diequatoriais para os grupos cafeoíla e a hidroxila (4-OH). Os ex- perimentos de NOESY 1D mostraram um aumento na intensidade do sinal em δH 3,92 (H-3) pela irradiação do sinal atribuído ao hidrogênio H-4 (3,56) e ausência de NOE quando da irradiação do sinal em δH 5,06 (H-5), consolidando a configuração relativa pro- posta. Tais informações foram confirmadas com dados da literatu- ra, indicando que a estrutura de 4 corresponde ao ácido 5-O- cafeoilquínico.9 Os dados obtidos dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiram caracterizar a substância 5 como sendo ácido gálico.10 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiram inferir que a substância 6 pertence à classe dos flavonóides. Entre outras fei- ções destacam-se o conjunto de sinais do espectro de 13C em δC 73,6, 85,0 e 198,3 atribuídos aos carbonos C-3, C-2 e C-4, respec- tivamente, indicando que 6 possui a estrutura de um diidroflavonol. Um par de dubletos em δH 5,91 (J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) e δH 5,88 (J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) foram atribuídos ao anel A 5,7,9,10-tetrassubstituído. Os sinais em δH 6,96 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H), δH 6,80 (d, J= 8,0 Hz, 1H) e δH 6,84 (dd, J= 2,0 e 8,0 Hz, 1H) corroboram o padrão 1,3,4- trissubstituído para o anel B. Ainda o espectro de RMN de 1H de 6 apresentou um par de dubletos em δH 4,90 (J= 12,0 Hz, 1H) e 4,49 (J= 12,0 Hz, 1H), os quais foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2 e H-3, respectivamente. A constante de acoplamento apresentada por estes dois dubletos (J= 12 Hz) sugere um acoplamento do tipo axial- axial, conduzindo à proposição de que o anel B e o grupo hidroxila 3-OH mantém uma relação anti. Estes dados analisados em conso- nância com os de RMN de 13C permitiram caracterizar 6 como sendo taxifolina.11 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 7 indica- ram uma estreita similaridade entre 6 e 7. A única diferença notada entre os espectros das duas substâncias refere-se aos sinais carac- terísticos de uma unidade glicosídica em 7. O sinal em δC 17,8, atribuído ao carbono metílico C-6” e o conjunto de sinais em δC 100,1 (C-1”), 71,7 (C-4”), 70,4 (C-3”), 70,1 (C-2”) e 69,0 (C-5”) permitiram caracterizar a unidade monosídica como sendo uma ramnose. O espectro de RMN de 1H demonstrou a presença de um dubleto em δH 4,04 que foi atribuído ao hidrogênio anomérico H- 1”, cuja constante de acoplamento de 1,5 Hz inferiu a configura- ção α para a unidade de ramnose. A correlação deste dubleto e o sinal em δC 75,7, atribuído ao carbono C-3, observada no mapa de contornos gHMBC, sugeriu que a unidade de ramnose se encontra ligada ao carbono C-3. Os dados espectroscópicos analisados para 7 indicaram tratar-se da estrutura da astilbina.12 A análise polarimétrica dos diidroflavonóis 6 e 7 indicou valores de rotação óptica específica de +17o (c= 1,02 MeOH, 27 oC) e –22 o (c= 0,82, MeOH, 27 oC), respectivamente. Esses dados sugerem as configu- rações absolutas R,R dos carbonos C-2 e C-3 presentes nas estrutu- ras moleculares de 6 e 7, os quais se mostraram compatíveis com os valores descritos na literatura.13 O espectro de RMN de 1H da substância 8 apresentou três si- nais característicos de hidrogênios aromáticos: δH 6,53 (s, 2H), 5,93 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) e 5,95 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) indicando tratar-se também de um flavonóide. Os sinais correspondentes a dois hidro- gênios metilênicos em δH 2,72 (dd, J= 3,0 e 17,0 Hz) e δH 2,86 (dd, J= 5,0 e 17,0 Hz) foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-4a e H-4b, respectivamente e permitiram atribuir a estrutura de uma catequina para 8. Os sinais relativos aos carbonos entre δC 100,1 e 157,9 e 29,1 analisados em conjunção com as correlações observadas no mapa de contornos gCOSY para os hidrogênios H-4a, H-4b e H-3 ajudaram a confirmar a proposição de uma catequina para 8. Os experimentos de NOESY 1D foram empregados visando confir- mar a estereoquímica relativa de C-2 e C-3. A irradiação em δH 2,73 (H-4a) causou aumento na intensidade do sinal em δH 4,19 (m, H-3). A irradiação do sinal em δH 2,86 (H-4b) também levou ao aumento de intensidade em δH 4,19 (H-3), indicando a proximi- dade destes hidrogênios. No entanto, pela intensidade dos NOE observados os sinais em δH 2,86 (H-4b) e δH 4,19 (H-3) estão posicionados na mesma face do plano do anel ao qual estão liga- dos. A irradiação do sinal em δH 2,73 (H-4a) também causou um incremento em δH 4,78 (sl, H-2), indicando uma correlação 1,3- diaxial entre H-4a e H-2. Ao irradiar-se o sinal em δH 4,19 (H-3), houve um ganho de intensidade em δH 4,78 (H-2) e δH 2,73 (H-4a) coerente com uma relação sin entre H-2, H-3 e H-4a. Estes dados analisados em consonância com as constantes de acoplamento destes sinais permitiram atribuir a configuração relativa proposta. O mapa de contornos gHMBC demonstrou uma intensa correlação entre o si- nal em δH 3,80 (s, 3H), atribuído a um hidrogênio metoxílico e o sinal em δC 136,0, o qual está relacionado ao carbono C-4’, sugerindo que o grupo metoxila se encontra ligado ao carbono C-4’. A medida da rota- ção óptica específica de 8 [α]D 27 = -58o (c= 1,22, acetona) indicou as 804 Quim. Nova Regasini et al. configurações R e R dos carbonos C-2 e C-3, similares aos valores encontrados para a epigalocatequina.14 Os dados apresentados são com- patíveis com estrutura da ourateacatequina,15 confirmando sua identi- dade com 8. A análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracte- rizar a substância 9 também como um flavonóide. O espectro de RMN de 13C apresentou os sinais em δC 177,3, 155,4 e 132,9 atri- buídos aos carbonos C-4, C-2 e C-3, respectivamente, evidencian- do a subclasse dos flavonóis. Os sinais em δC 144,7 e 148,7 atribu- ídos aos carbonos C-3’ e C-4’, respectivamente, evidenciaram um flavonol cujo anel B encontra-se 1’,3’,4’-trissubstituído. Adicio- nalmente, os sinais de RMN de 13C compreendidos entre δC 60,6 e δC 82,6 analisados com os sinais de RMN de 1H em δH 5,66 (d, J= 7,5 Hz, 1H) e δH 4,58 (d, J=7,5 Hz, 1H) correspondentes a dois hidrogênios anoméricos indicaram duas subunidades de glicose e, com base no valor da constante de acoplamento (J= 7,5 Hz) para estes dois dubletos, verificou-se tratar de duas subunidades de β- glicose. Os experimentos de gHMBC demonstraram duas correla- ções entre os dubletos em δH 5,66 e δH 4,58 atribuídos aos hidrogê- nios anoméricos H-1” e H-1’”, respectivamente, e o sinal em δH 82,6 sugerindo que a ligação interglicosídica seja do tipo 2”’→1’”. O mapa de contornos gHMBC de 9 também apresentou uma corre- lação entre o sinal em δC 132,9 atribuído ao carbono C-3 e o dubleto em δC 5,66, levando à conclusão que a posição de O-glicosilação se encontra em C-3. Pelos dados obtidos pode-se caracterizar 9 como sendo quercetina 3-O-soforosídeo.16 Análise dos dados de RMN de 13C das substância 10 e 11 indi- cou tratar-se de alcalóides de estruturas bastante similares. Entre outras características destacam-se a presença de sinais em torno de δC 155,7 e 156,9 (C-2) típico de carbono guanidínico e um conjun- to de cinco sinais relacionados às subunidades isoprenílicas em torno de δC 17,8/17,7; δC 25,2/25,1; δC 39,0/38,7; δC 119,2/119,0 e δC 135,8/136,0. A análise desses dados indicou que 10 e 11 contêm um núcleo guanidínico substituído por unidades hemiterpenoídicas. Dado evidenciado por dois singletos em δH 1,62 (H-4’) e δH 1,68 (H-5’) atribuídos aos hidrogênios dos grupos metílicos; um dubleto em δH 3,72 (d, J= 6,5, H-1’) e um tripleto em δH 5,16 (t, J= 6,5, H- 2’) relacionados aos hidrogênios metilênicos e metínico, respecti- vamente, para 10. Da mesma forma, dados similares caracteriza- ram a estrutura de 11, indicando que as estruturas em questão se tratam de alcalóides guanidino-prenilados. A única diferença entre os alcalóides 10 e 11 deve-se ao padrão de substituição do núcleo guanidínico. No alcalóide 10 o sinal δH 3,72 (J= 6,5 Hz), atribuído aos hidrogênios H-1’, apresenta-se como um dubleto devido ao acoplamento com H-2’. Adicionalmente, a ausência do hidrogênio azometínico na estrutura alcaloídica indicou o padrão N,N- dissubstituído para 10, que foi caracterizado como sendo a pteroginina.17 No alcalóide 11, a presença de um tripleto em δH 7,72 (t, J= 6,5, 1H) devido ao acoplamento do hidrogênio azometínico do núcleo guanidínico com H-1’ da unidade hemiterpênica indicou que a substituição terpênica ocorre nos ni- trogênios vicinais da estrutura guanidínica. Análise de todos os dados indica que 11 possui padrão N,N’ de substituição isoprenílica. Fundamentado nestas análises, a substância 11 foi caracterizada como a pteroginidina,5 um isômero constitucional do alcalóide 10. As substâncias 1-11 foram avaliadas quanto à sua capacidade de inibição sobre mieloperoxidase (MPO), uma heme-enzima abun- dante em polimorfonucleares (PMNs), e considerada uma macromolécula-chave na resposta imunológica inespecífica a vári- os agentes invasores, principalmente bactérias. A MPO é respon- sável pela conversão de peróxido de hidrogênio (H2O2) e ânions cloreto em água e ácido hipocloroso (HOCl) que, por sua vez, atua como um potente agente antimicrobiano. Além disso, o excesso da atividade de MPO e subseqüente produção exagerada de HOCl culmina em um intenso estresse oxidativo para os PMNs. A litera- tura correlaciona essa injúria oxidativa promovida por MPO e HOCl com inúmeros processos inflamatórios, tais como artritite reumatóide, fibrose cística, doença inflamatória intestinal (IBD), injúria pulmonar neonatal, etc. Dessa forma, a busca por inibidores de MPO a partir de fontes naturais torna-se de grande valia na descoberta de novos agentes anti-inflamatórios.18 Dentre as substâncias ensaiadas com MPO, apenas as substân- cias 5 e 9 mostraram-se ativas, exibindo CI50 de 17,5 e 3,72 nM, quando comparadas à quercetina, utilizada como controle positi- vo, que apresentou uma CI50 de 1,22 nM. O valor de CI50 da quercetina apresenta-se inferior àquele observado para o seu glicosídeo 9, sugerindo a importância de uma hidroxila livre na posição 3 para atividade de inibição de MPO. As demais substân- cias mostraram-se inativas (CI50 > 100 nM), incluindo a substância 6, um análogo hidrogenado da quercetina. Essa observação sugere que uma insaturação situada entre os carbonos C-2 e C-3 no núcleo flavonoídico para uma ação inibitória sobe MPO. Os extratos e frações obtidas das flores de P. nitens tiveram sua capacidade antioxidante avaliada no ensaio em cromatoplacas re- veladas com β-caroteno, mostrando-se ativos, uma vez que manti- veram a coloração laranja nos pontos de aplicação. As substâncias fenólicas isoladas neste estudo são provavelmente as responsáveis pela atividade antioxidante dessas frações detectadas pelo teste preliminar com β-caroteno e que foi anteriormente relatado por Cai e colaboradores, que demonstraram a capacidade seqüestrado- ra de radicais livres das substâncias 1-9 nos ensaios com DPPH (2,2-difenil-1-picrilidrazila) e ABTS [2,2’-azino-di-(3-etillben- zotiazolina-6-ácido sulfônico)].19 A atividade seqüestradora de ra- dicais exibida pelos derivados fenólicos vem sendo amplamente discutida na literatura e está correlacionada a fatores mesoméricos que conferem a esse grupo funcional uma alta reatividade como doadores de elétrons.20 Os alcalóides guanidínicos 10 e 11 tiveram seu poder antioxidante avaliado sobre os radicais DPPH e ABTS. Os resultados indicaram que os alcalóides são inativos no teste com DPPH (CI50 > 200 μM) e mostraram atividade baixa sobre o radical ABTS, apresentando CI50 de 87,7 e 190,0 μM, tendo a quercetina como controle positivo (CI50 de 7,64 e 3,12 μM para os radicais DPPH e ABTS, respectivamente). O estudo químico das flores de P. nitens culminou no isola- mento de onze substâncias de três classes químicas distintas: flavonóides (flavonóis, diidroflavonóis e catequinas), derivados do ácido cinâmico e alcalóides. Dentre esses, somente as substâncias 10 e 11 já haviam sido relatadas como pertencentes ao metaboloma de P. nitens. Este trabalho permitiu concluir ainda que os metabólitos secundários acumulados nas flores desta espécie são predominan- temente de natureza fenólica. A descrição dos constituintes acu- mulados em P. nitens é também de grande valia tendo em conta que sua madeira vem sendo empregada indiscriminadamente pela construção civil e, por tratar-se de um gênero monoespecífico, esta leguminosa está seriamente ameaçada de extinção.2 PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectrômetro Varian INOVA-500® operando a 500 MHz para o núcleo de 1H e 125 MHz para o núcleo de 13C, TMS foi utilizado como referência interna. Os dados de rotação óptica foram obtidos em polarímento Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena®. As análises por CLAE no modo analítico foram realizadas em equi- 805 Constituintes químicos das flores de Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae)# Vol. 31, No. 4 pamento ProStar/Varian® acoplado ao detector ProStar 330® de ar- ranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analítica Phenomenex® Fenil- Hexila (250 x 4,60 mm; 5 µm). No modo preparativo, as análises por CLAE foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar/Varian® acoplado ao detector ProStar-UV®, utilizando-se coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexila (250 x 21,2 mm; 10 μm). Nas separa- ções em coluna aberta foram utilizadas gel de sílica derivatizado C-18 (40-63 μm, Merck®), gel de sílica para cromatografia flash (35-70 μm) e para cromatografia de exclusão molecular (Sephadex,® LH-20). As análises por cromatografia em camada delgada foram realizadas com cromatoplacas de gel de sílica G60 (0,25 mm). Após o desenvolvimento das cromatoplacas estas foram visualizadas sob luz ultravioleta (λ = 254 e 365 nm) e reveladas com solução de anisaldeído em ácido sulfúrico seguido de aquecimento. Material vegetal As flores de P. nitens foram coletadas no Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo – SP, no mês de abril de 2003, pela Dra. M. C. M. Young. O material botânico foi identificado como sendo Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae – Caesalpinoideae) pela Dra. I. Cordeiro, do mesmo Ins- tituto. Uma exsicata (SP204319) encontra-se depositada no herbário “Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann” do Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo - SP. Extração e isolamento As flores (1,8 kg) foram secas à temperatura ambiente por 15 dias e, posteriormente, submetidas à moagem empregando moi- nho de facas. O pó obtido (1,5 kg) foi levado à maceração empre- gando hexanos e posteriormente maceração em etanol. Após eva- poração, o extrato hexânico (3,8 g) foi analisado por RMN de 1H e CCDC mostrando tratar-se de uma mistura complexa de terpenos. O extrato etanólico (15,0 g) foi dissolvido em uma mistura de metanol:água (7:3) e posteriormente submetido à partição líquido- líquido empregando acetato de etila e n-butanol. A fração AcOEt (3,8 g) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna de permeação em gel (Sephadex®, LH-20, 180 x 5 cm), eluída em MeOH, obtendo-se 25 subfrações de 75 mL. A subfração AcOEt-17 (143,0 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia flash em coluna de gel de sílica (28 x 3 cm), eluída em modo gradiente (CHCl3:MeOH, 100 a 50%), obtendo-se os ácidos cafeico (1; 12, 0 mg), ferúlico (2; 14,0 mg) e sinápico (3, 7,0 mg). A subfração AcOEt-20 (79 mg) foi subme- tida à cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (8 x 3 cm) empregando misturas de MeOH:H2O (30 a 80%), resultando no isolamento de dois flavonóides, taxifolina (6, 14 mg) e ourateacatequina (8, 15 mg). A fração n-butanólica (3,0 g) foi submetida à cromatografia por exclusão molecular (LH-20, Sephadex, 180 x 5 cm) eluída em MeOH, resultando em 22 subfrações de 70 mL. A subfração BuOH- 7 (280 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna de gel de sílica (28 x 4 cm), eluída em misturas de CHCl3:MeOH (10 a 30%), obtendo-se dois alcalóides guanidínicos, pteroginina (10, 98 mg) e pteroginidina (11, 90 mg). A subfração BuOH-12 (120 mg) foi sub- metida à cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (10 x 3 cm), eluída em MeOH:H2O (1:1), obtendo-se astilbina (7, 27 mg). A subfração BuOH-18 (97 mg) foi submetida à CLAE-UV preparativo [MeOH:H2O (56:44), λ = 254 nm, fluxo = 11,0 mL/min), culmi- nando no isolamento do flavonol glicosilado (9, 18 mg). A fração hidroalcoólica (1,7 g) foi inicialmente submetida à cromatografia de permeação em gel (Sephadex®, LH-20, 120 x 8 cm), eluída em MeOH, obtendo-se 13 subfrações de 35 mL. A subfração HA-5 foi identificada como ácido gálico (5, 11 mg) e a subfração HA-12, como sendo o ácido 5-O-cafeoilquínico (4, 22 mg). Atividades antioxidante e inibitória sobre mieloperoxidase (MPO) Para os ensaios em CCD reveladas com β-caroteno, as amos- tras foram eluídas e reveladas com uma solução diclorometânica de β-caroteno a 0,02%. Após revelação, a cromatoplaca foi mantida à exposição de luz solar até total perda de coloração. Os pontos que mantiveram a coloração laranja indicaram a presença de subs- tâncias antioxidantes.21 Os ensaios de capacidade seqüestradora de radicais livres realizados para as substâncias 10 e 11 seguiram pro- tocolos relatados na literatura com pequenas modificações.22 A atividade inibitória sobre MPO das substâncias 1-11 foi avalia- da segundo o método de oxidação do guaiacol. O meio reacional cons- tituído de uma mistura de MPO (8,0 nM), peróxido de hidrogênio (0,3 mM) e guaiacol (70 mM) foi utilizado para a avaliação da ação de MPO na presença das substâncias em estudo e do controle positivo quercetina. As substâncias foram dissolvidas em DMSO nas concen- trações 0,50; 5,0; 10,0; 25,0; 50,0 e 100 nM. Após o tempo de reação (4 h), o meio reacional foi lido em espectrofotômetro (470 nm). A atividade inibitória foi expressa em CI50, valor calculado a partir da plotagem de um gráfico correlacionando velocidade inicial versus absorbância, obtendo-se, assim, as curvas concentração-resposta.23 AGRADECIMENTOS À Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), Programa BIOTA-FAPESP (Instituto Virtual da Biodiversidade, www.biota.org.br), Conselho Nacional de Desen- volvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) e à Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).

A chemical study on the EtOAc extract produced by Xylaria sp., an endophytic fungus from Piper aduncum, resulted in the isolation of a new cytochalasin 1, along with five known 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5), and R (6). The 1-6 were evaluated against the fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum and only 5 showed weak activity. The cytotoxicity in vitro against HeLA and CHO cells lines were investigated and the cytochalasins 2-4, and 6 showed a strong activity against HeLA. The DNAdamaging activity of 1-6 were also investigated against mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. Keywords: Xylaria sp.; Piper aduncum; endophytic fungus. INTRODUÇÃO Aproximadamente um quarto de todos os produtos naturais biologicamente ativos conhecidos têm sido produzidos por fun gos.1 Estes são estimados em 1,5 milhões de espécies2 distribuídos principalmente entre fungos micoparasitas, coprófilos, de solo, de água doce, epifíticos e endofíticos. Fungos endofíticos são micro- organismos que habitam o interior de um vegetal,3 em pelo menos por um período de seu ciclo de vida. Apesar de serem produtores de metabólitos secundários biologicamente ativos,4 são pouco explorados. Dando continuidade aos estudos de prospecção química e bioló gica em fungos endofíticos isolados de espécies vegetais do cerrado, a espécie vegetal Piper aduncum foi selecionada, pois a medicina popular relata propriedades diurética, cicatrizante e anti-hemorrá gica.5-7 Dados fitoquímicos de P. aduncum relatam a ocorrência de amidas, fenilpropanoides, di-hidrochalconas e derivados prenilados com atividades moluscida, bactericida e citotóxica.8,9 Estes fatos, associados às observações de que micro-organismos endofíticos podem mimetizar a química de seus respectivos hospedeiros e produzirem substâncias ou derivados com maior bioatividade,10 direcionaram o estudo químico/biológico dos fungos endofíticos associados à P. aduncum. P. aduncum foi submetida ao isolamento e à purificação dos endófitos e conduziu a seis linhagens puras. Após triagem quími ca/biológica, a linhagem PA-01 foi classificada como Xylaria sp. e selecionada para estudo, mediante atividade seletiva do extrato bruto AcOEt contra a linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevi siae RS 321 e contra os fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. O fungo Xylaria sp. foi cultivado no meio de cultura PDB, em escala ampliada, para obtenção do extrato bruto que, após fracio namento cromatográfico por CLAE, levou ao isolamento de uma citocalasina inédita (1) e das 19,20-epoxicitocalasina conhecidas D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5) e (6). A estrutura das substâncias isoladas foi determinada com base nas análises dos dados espectrométricos de IV, EM-ES, RMN de 1H e 13C (1D e 2 D). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A fórmula molecular da citocalasina 1 foi estabelecida como C30H37NO7 por ESI-EMAR (m/z 524,2729 [M + H]+) e com auxílio dos espectros de RMN de 13C e DEPT. O espectro no IV mostrou as absorções de hidroxila (3440 cm-1) e uma absorção larga (1710 cm-1) atribuída a estiramentos C=O. A análise dos dados de RMN de 1H, 13C e DEPT indicou a presença de quatro átomos de carbono carbonílico (sendo dois de grupos cetona), um anel benzênico mo nossubstituído, cinco metilas, onze átomos de carbono de grupos metínicos (dois olefínicos e três carbinólicos), dois metilênicos e dois átomos de carbono quaternário, sendo um carbinólico. O índice de deficiência de hidrogênio calculado foi igual a 13. Estes dados são característicos de substâncias da classe das citocalasinas. A atribuição de todos os átomos de hidrogênio aos respectivos átomos de carbonos foi realizada com auxílio dos mapas de contorno do experimento gHMQC. A análise dos espectros de gCOSY e TOCSY indicou os átomos de hidrogênios acoplados em série e permitiu identificar os quatro sistemas de spins da molécula H-2’ a H-6’; H-10 a H-12; H-8 a H-22 e H-19 a H-21. A estereoquímica da ligação dupla entre C-13 e C-14, assim como o epóxido em C-19 e C-20 foi definida como trans pelas constantes de acoplamento (J = 15,5 e 2,0 Hz, respectivamente).11 A correlação gHM BC de H-10a (dH 2,68) com C-1´ (dC 137,5) confirmou a presença do grupo fenil em C-10. As correlações de H-12 (dH 1,01) e H-8 (dH 3,42) Citocalasinas produzidas por Xylaria sp. 2039 Vol. 33, No. 10 com C-7 (dC 212,6) e comparação com dados de citocalasa-13(E),19(E)- dieno-1,7,17-triona,12 possibilitaram a elucidação do núcleo isoindolona. As correlações de H-22 (dH 1,12) e H-23 (dH 1,44) com C-17 (δC 214,9) e entre H-21 (dH 5,43) e C-8 (dC 51,2) e comparação com 19,20-epoxi citocalasina C (3)13 permitiram elucidar o anel macrocíclico. As configurações relativas do núcleo isoindolona e do anel macrocíclico de 1 foram estabelecidas pelo experimento NOESY, onde se observou correlação entre H-4 e H-21, valores dos desloca mentos químicos de RMN de 1H e 13C, constantes de acoplamento e comparação com 18,21-di-hidroxi-16,18-dimetil-10-fenil-citocalasa- 13(E),19(E)-dieno-1,7,17-triona12 e com 19,20-epoxicitocalasina C (3),13 respectivamente, Figura 1. Estas informações permitiram estabelecer a configuração relativa da inédita citocalasina 1. As substâncias 2-6 foram identificadas pela análise por EM, RMN de 1H e 13C, gHMQC, gHMBC, gCOSY e NOESY e por comparação com dados descritos na literatura.13 As citocalasinas 1-6 (Figura 1) foram avaliadas quanto à atividade antifúngica, frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium clados porioides e C. sphaerospermum, usando-se o método da autobiografia direta.14 A substância 5 mostrou uma fraca atividade na concentração de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrão nistatina (1mg mL- 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentaram-se inativas. As substâncias 1-6 foram ensaiadas frente à linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevisiae RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica não serem as responsáveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15 A avaliação da atividade citotóxica de 1-6 foi realizada em células de mamíferos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cérvix humano) e CHO (ovário de hamster chinês).16 Para a linhagem não cancerígena CHO, as substâncias 2, 3, 5 e 6 apresentaram IC50 de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As citocalasinas 1 e 4 não apresen taram IC50 nas concentrações testadas, sendo que 1 foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1. Na linhagem cancerígena HeLa as substâncias 1-6 apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 5,0 mmol L-1. A forte atividade apresentada pelas citocalasinas 2-5 contra a linhagem cancerígena HeLa e a fraca contra a linhagem não cance rígena CHO evidenciam uma seletividade destas substâncias para as linhagens tumorais HeLa. Para o nosso conhecimento, este é o primeiro relato de citocalasinas sendo produzidas por fungos endofíticos associados à Piper aduncum. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentação Os espectros de absorção na região do IV foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa resolução da marca Fisons, modelo VG Pla tfform II, no modo de ionização electrospray (ESI). Os espectros Figura 1. Estruturas das substâncias isoladas de Xylaria sp. Silva et al. 2040 Quim. Nova de massas de alta resolução foram obtidos em espectrômetro QTOF (Micromass), utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em CDCl3 e DMSO-d6, no espectrômetro Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrão de referência. O aparelho de cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE) foi um Varian Pro Star, com detectores UV-Vis. As colunas analíticas e preparativas utilizadas foram Phenomenex tipo Luna - C18 (250 x 4,60 mm, 5 mm) e (250 x 21,20 mm, 10 mm), respectivamente. Os meios de cultura líquido e sólido foram submetidos à esterili zação em autoclave a 121 °C e 1 atm de pressão por 20 min. Material vegetal Folhas saudáveis de Piper aduncum foram coletadas na Casa de Vegetação do Instituto de Química - UNESP- Araraquara em maio de 2001. Isolamento dos fungos endofíticos As folhas coletadas foram lavadas com água e sabão, a seguir esterilizadas por imersão em NaClO (1%) por 5 min, seguido de etanol 70% por 1 min e lavadas com água esterilizada 2 vezes por 10 min.17-22 As folhas esterilizadas foram assepticamente seccionadas em segmentos de 1 cm2 aproximadamente e colocados em placa de Petri, contendo o meio de cultura batata dextrose ágar (PDA), marca Difco, preparado na concentração de 39 g/L, acrescido do antibiótico sulfato de gentamicina e incubado a 25 oC. O crescimento dos fungos foi monitorado diariamente e, após cada cultura atingir de 1-2 cm em diâmetro, foram submetidos a sucessivas repicagens até obtenção das linhagens puras. Foram obtidas seis linhagens puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Química Orgânica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como Xylaria sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Coleção Micológica de Lavras, Universi dade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292. Cultivo em meio líquido e obtenção dos extratos brutos O fungo endofítico Xylaria sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 dias. A seguir foi inoculado em 20 frascos de Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentração de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantidos em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 °C por 28 dias. Após este período o caldo foi separado do micélio por filtração, extraído com AcOEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extraído com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fração CHCl3 (0,7 g). Isolamento das citocalasinas A fração CHCl3 (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de sílica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco frações: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1). Estas foram analisadas por CLAE-DAD (Si C-18, gradiente H2O:CH3CN 5 a 100% de CH3CN, 40 min, fluxo de 1 mL/min), sendo detectada uma alta concentração de citocalasinas na fração PA-01-3. A fração PA-01-3 foi submetida à CLAE-prep em fase reversa [l = 220 nm, 10 mL/min CH3CN:H2O (68:32)], resultando nas cito calasinas 1 (5,5 mg, tR = 71 min), 2 (17,5 mg, tR = 32 min), 3 (30,0 mg, tR = 54 min), 4 (15,0 mg, tR = 26 min), 5 (15,5 mg, tR = 74 min), e 6 (12,5 mg, tR = 43 min). Bioensaios Teste de bioautografia com fungos Para avaliação da atividade antifúngica do extrato bruto AcOEt e das substâncias 1-6 frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioi des e C. sphaerospermum, utilizou-se a metodologia descrita anterior mente na literatura.14 Os ensaios foram realizados nas concentrações de 5, 10, 20, 50 e 100 µg mL-1, usando nistatina como controle positivo. Teste para avaliação preliminar da atividade citotóxica Para a avaliação da atividade citotóxica do extrato bruto AcOEt e das substâncias 1-6, foram utilizadas três linhagens mutantes de Sac charomyces cerevisiae (rad+, 52Y e RS 321), segundo metodologia descrita na literatura.15 Os extratos foram testados na concentração de 2 mg mL-1 e as substâncias puras com 0,5 mg mL-1, como padrões foram utilizados: camptotecina: rad+ 200 µg mL-1 (16,0 mm; 16,0 mm) e 52Y (5 µg mL-1; 21,0 mm) e estreptonigrina: RS-321 (4 µg mL-1 20,0 mm).

Extração ácido-base de uma nova porção do extrato bruto etanólico permitiu a identificação do alcalóide liriodenina. Os derivados fenilpropanoídicos e o alcalóide N-acetilnonaina estão sendo descritos pela primeira vez no gênero Michelia. O alcalóide liriodenina e a lignana siringaresinol apresentaram atividade antifúngica moderada. Palavras-chave: Magnoliaceae; Michelia champaca; alcalóides; atividade antifúngica. Introdução Magnoliaceae compreende cerca de 10 gêneros e 220 espécies, sendo que a maioria ocorre no Hemisfério Norte, mas também são encontrados na Ásia (Índia e Malásia) e América do Sul (Brasil). No Brasil são cultivadas várias espécies dos gêneros Magnolia e Michelia, popularmente conhecidas como magnólia amarela [1]. A espécie Michelia champaca aparece como uma planta importante na medicina indígena [2]. É usada pela população para regular a menstruação, combater infecções da garganta e febres, artrites, reumatismos [3], como anticoncepcional [2] e como proteção pós- parto [4]. Estudo farmacológico com o extrato da casca da raiz indicou propriedade inseticida potente contra a larva do mosquito Aedes egyptii [5]. Estudos fitoquímico e biológico com raízes [6], cascas da raiz [7] e folhas [6] de M. champaca levaram ao isolamento de lactonas sesquiterpênicas com significativa atividade antitumoral e permitiram estabelecer o perfil químico deste gênero como essencialmente terpênico [5], com predominância das lactonas sesquiterpênicas. KHAN e colaboradores [4] relatam, com base em triagem fitoquímica, a presença de alcalóides, flavonóides, taninos, saponinas, além de triterpenóides em folhas, sementes, caules e raízes de M. champaca. O flavonóide quercetina foi isolado das flores, pela primeira vez no gênero por KAPOOR e JAGGI [8]. Além da atividade antitumoral descrita anteriormente, alguns autores relatam também atividade antifúngica para a espécie. O extrato metanólico das flores 13 Ecl. Quím., São Paulo, 32(3): 13-18, 2007 de M. champaca mostrou forte atividade frente ao patógeno Staphylococcus aureus [9]. Os extratos diclorometânico e metanólico das folhas apresentaram atividade moderada frente a vários fungos patogênicos e fitopatogênicos [10]. Ainda, sementes, caules e raízes foram bioativos quando ensaiados com fungos patogênicos humanos [4]. Neste trabalho, descrevemos o fracionamento biomonitorado dos caules de M. champaca, buscando isolar e identificar os possíveis metabólitos secundários responsáveis pela atividade antifúngica detectada na fase diclorometânica quando bioensaiadas com os fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. Materiais e Métodos Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em espectrômetro Varian AS 500 (500 MHz para 1H e 125 MHz para 13C). Foram utilizados os solventes deuterados CDCl3, DMSO-d6 e CD3OD, produzidos pela Acros, Aldrich ou CIL, sendo TMS o padrão interno. As colunas cromatográficas tiveram como fase estacionária sílica gel 60 H (70 – 230 mesh, Merck) e sílica C18 (43 – 60 μm). As análises em cromatografia em camada delgada foram realizadas em sílica gel 60 F254 (placa) e as manchas visualizadas por absorção da radiação UV, anisaldeído 2% em H2SO4 seguida de aquecimento, câmara de iodo e solução dragendorff. Os cromatogramas foram obtidos por Cromatografia Líquida de Alta Eficiência (CLAE), num aparelho Varian ProStar, com detector UV-Vis, registrados em microcomputador de 500 MHz com processador Pentium II. Foram utilizadas colunas analíticas Phenomenex Luna C18 (5 ?m, 250 x 4,6 mm) e coluna preparativa Phenomenex Luna C18 (10 μm, 250 x 21,20 mm). Os solventes orgânicos utilizados para obtenção de extratos e fracionamentos foram das marcas Mallinckrodt, Synth e J. T. Baker (grau CLAE). A água (grau CLAE) foi obtida usando um sistema de purificação Milli-Q Plus (Millipore). As soluções foram concentradas em evaporador rotativo Buchi R-114, sob pressão reduzida. Os espectros de massas de baixa resolução foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Platfform, no modo electrospray. Os espectros de infravermelho foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Nicolet-730 FT-IR. Material vegetal Michelia champaca L. (Magnoliaceae) foi coletada no Campus da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), em Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brasil e identificada pela Dra. Inês Cordeiro do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado de São Paulo. Extração e isolamento dos constituintes químicos Os caules M. champaca foram secos à temperatura ambiente, moídos e submetidos à percolação em etanol, resultando no extrato bruto (55,30 g), após evaporação do solvente sob pressão reduzida. O extrato bruto foi solubilizado em MeOH/H2O (70:30, v/v) e submetico à partição com solventes de diferentes polaridades, fornecendo as fases hexânica (9,00 g), diclorometânica (13,04 g), acetato de etila (4,82 g), n-butanólica (11,90 g) e hidroalcóolica (9,08 g). Todas essas fases foram bioensaiadas para averiguação da atividade antifúngica. Parte da fase diclorometânica (6,5 g), a qual foi a única a apresentar atividade, foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna (CC) usando sílica gel (70 – 230 mesh) e eluída com hexano/AcOEt e AcOEt/MeOH em misturas de polaridade crescente, fornecendo 22 frações, após análise por cromatografia em camada delgada. A fração 8 (690 mg, eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 80:20, v/v) foi submetida à CC utilizando sílica de fase reversa C18, eluída com MeOH/H2O em gradiente decrescente de polaridade, obtendo-se 6 frações. A subfração 8.3 (74,2 mg, eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 40:60, v/v) foi submetida a CLAE preparativa em fase reversa C18 (λ = 254 nm, MeOH/H2O 80:20 (v/v), fluxo de 10 mL min-1), 14 Ecl. Quím., São Paulo, 32(3): 13-18, 2007 fornecendo as substâncias 1 (4,6 mg) e 2 (3,7 mg). A fração 7 (420 mg, Hex/AcOEt 10:90, v/v) foi cromatografada em coluna de fase reversa C18, eluída em MeOH/H2O em gradiente crescente de polaridade, obtendo- se 10 frações. A subfração 7.5 (69,6 mg, MeOH/H2O 65:35, v/v) foi submetida a CLAE preparativa λ = 247 nm, MeOH/ H2O 50:50 (v/v), fluxo de 17 mL min-1) e forneceu a substância 3 (9,3 mg). A fração 5 (380 mg, Hex/AcOEt 40:60, v/v) foi também submetida a cromatografia em fase reversa, à vácuo, fornecendo 11 frações. A subfração 5.8 (70,9 mg, MeOH/H2O 80:20, v/v) foi submetida a cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa de fase normal, sendo eluída em AcOEt/MeOH 20:80 (v/v) e fornecendo a substância 4 (8,0 mg), após recristalização em MeOH. Uma nova porção do extrato bruto (25,0 g) foi solubilizada em HCl 5%, após precipitação do material graxo com metanol. Fez-se, em seguida, extração com AcOEt, basificação da fase aquosa e novamente extração com AcOEt [11]. A fração alcaloídica (247,4 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna utilizando C18, eluída em MeOH/H2O em gradiente decrescente de polaridade, fornecendo a substância 5 (14,5 mg, MeOH/H2O 70:30, v/v). Bioensaio antifúngico Estes ensaios foram realizados no laboratório do Instituto de Botânica de São Paulo sob a supervisão da Dra. Maria Cláudia Marx Young. Suspensões contendo esporos dos fungos das espécies Cladosporium cladosporoides e Cladosporium sphaerospermum foram utilizadas como reveladores em cromatografia em camada delgada para a realização da bioautografia [12]. A amostra de extratos foi aplicada em cromatoplacas e eluída com solventes adequados. Após a evaporação dos solventes e localização das manchas por meio de absorção no ultravioleta, uma solução de glicose e sais contendo esporos do fungo foi nebulizada sobre as placas que foram incubadas à temperatura de 25º C em câmara úmida e escura durante 2 a 3 dias. Após o tempo de incubação, observou-se o crescimento do fungo sobre a placa. Nos locais onde existem substâncias fungitóxicas surge um halo de inibição. Foi utilizado nistatina (1 μg) como padrão positivo. Resultados e Discussão As fases hexânica, diclorometânica, acetato de etila, n-butanólica e hidroalcóolica, provenientes da partição líquido-líquido do extrato etanólico, foram bioensaiadas com os fungos Cladosporium cladosporoides e C. sphaerospermum, sendo que apenas a fase diclorometânica apresentou atividade moderada. Esta fase foi, então, fracionada em coluna cromatográfica de fase normal fornecendo dois derivados fenilpropanoídicos, álcool 4-O-β-D-glicopiranosídeo sinapílico (1) e aldeído 4-O-β-D-glicopiranosídeo sinápico (2), uma lignana siringaresinol (3) e um alcalóide N-acetilnonaina (4) (Figura 1). Avaliação prévia do extrato bruto com revelador draggendorff, detectou a ocorrência de alcalóides na matriz vegetal. Assim, o extrato bruto foi submetido a extração ácido-base para obtenção de uma fração rica em alcalóides, que foi fracionada em coluna cromatográfica de fase reversa e levou ao isolamento de liriodenina (5) (Figura 1). As estruturas de todas as substâncias isoladas foram determinadas através de métodos espectroscópicos (EM, IV e RMN de 1H e 13C, uni e bidimensionais) e confirmadas através da comparação com dados da literatura. Todas as substâncias isoladas do extrato ativo e a substância 5 foram submetidas a bioautografia com os fungos Cladosporium cladosporoides e C. sphaerospermum, e as substâncias 3 e 5 15 Ecl.

Abstract: The fractionation of the dichlorometanic layer of dried stems of Michelia champaca afforded four substances: sinapyl 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside alcohol, sinapyl 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside aldehyde, syringaresinol and N-acetylnonaine. Part of the crude extract portion was submitted to acid-basic extraction allowed the identification of the alkaloid liriodenine. The two phenylpropanoids derivatives and the alkaloid N-acetylnonaine were been reported for the first time from Michelia genus. The alkaloid liriodenine and the lignan syringaresinol showed moderate antifungal activity. Keywords: Magnoliaceae, Michelia champaca, alkaloids, antifungal activity M. C. M. Monteiro, I. H.

A lignana siringaresinol já havia sido isolada da espécie Michelia fuscata, enquanto que liriodenina é comumente encontrada no gênero e em outras partes de M. champaca. A atividade antifúngica detectada na fase diclorometânica e confirmada na lignana 3 e no alcalóide 5 é um dado relevante, já que é a primeira vez que está sendo descrito para uma lignana. Substâncias com atividade frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos do gênero Cladosporium são de grande interesse para a agricultura. 17 Ecl.

ABSTRACT: Chromatographic fractionation of the organic extract from leaves of Ouratea multiﬂ ora afforded the ﬂ avone dimers heveaﬂ avone, amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl eter, podocarpusﬂ avone-A and amentoﬂ avone. Their structures were elucidated from spectral data, including 2D-NMR experiments of the natural substances. Biological activities of all isolates were evaluated, using antimicrobial assay against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, cytotoxicity assay against mouse lymphoma (L5178) and KB cell lines, TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidant activity measured by DPPH test. Keywords: Ochnaceae, Ouratea multiﬂ ora, biﬂ avonoids, antibacterial activity. INTRODUCTION Species of the Ochnaceae family are distributed in tropical and subtropical zones throughout the World (Hegnauer, 1969; Carvalho et al., 2000) This family is characterized by the presence of ﬂ avonoids and biﬂ avonoids and terpenoids as main secondary metabolites (Oliveira et al., 2002; Estevam et al 2005). Several members of the Ouratea genus are employed for the extraction of edible oil, and are used as medicinal plants (Moreira et al., 1994; Agra et al., 2007). As part of our research program on the bioactive constituents of Atlantic Forest plant species, we have investigated Ouratea multiﬂ ora collected in Juréia Reserve, São Paulo State. As result, four ﬂ avonoid dimers: heveaﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986) amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl-ether (Geiger, 1986), podocarpusﬂ avone-A (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987) and amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987; Felício et al., 2001), were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the leaves. Additionally, the biological activity of the isolates was also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS General procedure 1H and 13C NMR, inverse heteronuclear HMQC and HMBC as well as COSY experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument operating at 500 MHz for hydrogen, and 125 MHz for carbon, respectively. Pyridine-d5 or DMSO-d6 were used as solvents and TMS as internal standard. TLC was performed on precoated aluminum sheets (silica F254, 0.25 mm, Merck, Parmtadt, Germany) with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and by spraying with anisaldeyde reagent followed by heating (120 °C). Silica gel (230-400 mesh ASTM, particle size 0.040- 0.063 µM, Merck) or Sephaex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used in the CC fractionations. Plant material Ouratea multiﬂ ora was collected at the Botanical reserve of Juréia, São Paulo, Brazil and a 320 Carlos Alberto Carbonezi, Lidilhone Hamerski, A. A. Leslie Gunatilaka, et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 voucher was placed at the Botanical Institute, São Paulo State, Brazil. Extraction and isolation Dried powdered leaves of Ouratea multiﬂ ora (118.0 g) were extracted by maceration using ethanol at room temperature. The extract was ﬁ ltered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude extract (3.44 g) was dissolved in n-BuOH. Subsequent addition of water afforded two phases which were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The n-BuOH fraction (2.10 g) was solubilized with methanol/water (8:2 v/v) and partitioned with n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate, successively. The ethyl acetate phase after concentration of the solvent (980.0 mg), was chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column with a gradient elution of MeOH/H2O. The separation was monitored by TLC, and eluted fractions exhibiting similar appearances were combined, yielding 20 fractions. Fractions 7 and 8 showed a solid precipitation. The solid was washed with cold methanol to afford heveaﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986) (1) (21.2 mg). Fraction 13 was chromatographed on silica gel yielding amentoﬂ avone 7”, 4”’-dimethyl ether (2) (10.8 mg). Fraction 15 gave a powder after precipitation. This powder was washed with cold methanol to afford podocarpusﬂ avone-A 3 (Markam et al., 1987) (8.9 mg). Fraction 17 was chromatographed on silica gel using CHCl3:MeOH (4:6) yielding amentoﬂ avone 4 (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987) (15.0 mg). Antimicrobial assay Sterile ﬁ lter paper disks were impregnated with 20 mg of samples using DMSO as carrier solvent. The impregnated disks were then placed on agar plates previously inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 2592) and Bacillus subtilis (DSM 2105). Solvent controls were incubated at 37 oC for each organism, and after incubate time of 24 h at 37 oC, antimicrobial activity was recorded as clear zones (in mm) of inhibition surrounding the disk. The sample was considered active when the inhibition surrounding the disk was greater than 7 mm. Cytotoxicity assay Antiproliferative activity was examined against two cell lines and was determined through an MTT assay as described earlier (Edrada et al., 1996). TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors The protocol adopted for this in vitro assay is described by Ellman and co-workers (Ellman et al., 1961). Determination of the radical-scavenging activity The determination of the antioxidant activity was tested according to a protocol described elsewhere (Cardoso et al., 2004; So; Lewis, 2002).

The 13C NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed 31 signals, which were attributed to twelve sp2 CH, including signals at δCH 114.1 and 127.6, each representing two carbon atoms, three sp3 carbons (δCH3 55.1, 55.5 and 55.9), sixteen sp2 quaternary carbons and two carbonyl groups (δC 181.6 and 182.2) (Table 2).

A. Leslie Gunatilaka, et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals for two chelated hydroxyls at δH 13.19 and 12.93 (OH-5 and OH-5”), three aromatic methoxyl groups, a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring (B ring) and a 1,4-disubstituted (B’ ring). The 1H NMR spectra [1D and 2D (1H-1H-COSY)] showed a para-substituted aromatic ring at δH 7.55 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’), δH 6.82 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’), two meta aromatic hydrogens at δH 6.23 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-6), 6.49 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8), commonly observed in a ﬂ avone nucleous. The structure of 1 was established on the basisi of HMBC spectra, which showed heteronuclear long- range couplings of quaternary carbons C-7’’ (δC 161.2), C-7 (δC 164.8) and C-4”’ (δC 162.4) with the hydrogens of methoxyl groups at δH 3.72 (OMe-7’’), 3.77 (OMe-7), and 3.81 (OMe-4”’), respectively, and by comparison of their spectral data with those reported for heveaﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986). Compound 2 also showed spectral features of a ﬂ avonoid dimer derivative (Table 2). The 1H MNR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 showed the presence of to chelated hydroxyl and at δH 3.83 and δH 3.75 two methoxyl groups. The 1H-1H-COSY spectrum of compound 2 showed a set of doublets at δH 7.66 (d, J 9.5 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’) and δH 6.91 (d, J 9.5 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) of an AA’BB’ system, besides the signals at δH 7.98 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.14 (d, J 8.5, H-5’) and 8.01 (dd, J 8.5; 2.5, H-6’) attributed to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring. Furthermore, the 1H-1H-COSY spectrum showed signals with a meta coupling pattern at δH 6.17 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-6) and 6.45 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8) corresponding to an A ring of a ﬂ avone. The HMBC spectrum of 2 revealed correlations of the hydrogen-bonded OH-5 (δH 12.94) with C-5 (δC 161.4), C-6 (δC 98.8) and C-10 (δC 103.7), while OH-5” (δH 13.20) correlated with C-5” (δC 161.4), C-6” (δC 95.6) and C-10” (δC 104.2). From the long range coupling of H-6 (δH 6.17) and H-3 (δH 6.82) with C-10 (δC 103.7); H-3”’ and H-5”’ (δH 6.91) with C- 1”’ (δC 122.9); and H-3” (δH 6.92) with C-10” (δC 104.2) thus, the structure of 2 was established to be a dimer. A literature search conﬁ rmed the structure of 2 as 7”,4”’- dimethoxy-amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986). 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 showed signals at δH 13.05, δC 182.2, δH 12.95, and δC 181.8 of two hydrogen of chelated hydroxyl groups, and an O-methyl group at δH 3.74 (δC 55.5). A detailed analysis of cross peaks from the 1H-1H COSY spectrum showed two doublets for a mono-oxygenated para disubstituted system at δH 7.65 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’) and 6.91 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’), one trioxygenated tetra substituted ring with alternating oxy-substituents at δH 6.17 (d, J 1.5 Hz, H-6) and δH 6.45 (d, J 1.5 Hz, H-8), and one mono-oxygenated trisubstituted system at δH 7.98 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.15 (d, J 8.5 Hz, H-5’) and 8.00 (dd, J 8.5; 2.5 Hz, H-6’). Additional 1D and 2D NMR data indicated a pentasubstituted aromatic ring with a 5,7- dioxygenation pattern for the A’ ring of a ﬂ avone (δH 6.41, H-6”) and two singlets (δH 6.81 (H-3), δH 6.86 (H-3’’) of both ﬂ avones units in compound 3. Analysis of HMBC spectra revealed characteristic correlations which deﬁ ned the positions of aromatic rings and their substitution patterns. Correlations of H-3 (δ 6.81) with C-2 (δ 163.8), C-4 (δ 181.7), C-10 (δ 103.7), C-1’ (δ 121.1) and H-3” (δ 6.86) with C-2” (δ 163.2), C-4” (δ 182.2), C-10” (δ 103.7), C-1”’ (δ 123.0) established the linkages between rings C/B and C”/B”, respectively. Moreover, the correlation between H-2’ (δ 7.98) and C- 8” (δ 104.0) showed the linkage between C-3’and C-8”. The ROESY correlation observed between methoxyl group at δH 3.74 and the aromatic protons at δH 6.91 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) justify the location of the methoxyl group at C-4”’ of the B’ aromatic ring. These data are in agreement with those published for podocarpusﬂ avone- A (Geiger, 1986; Markham, et al., 1987). 1H NMR spectrum of 4 showed two signals at δH 13.09 and 12.96 due to chelated phenolic hydroxyls, and two doublets at δH 7.56 (J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’), and 6.70 (J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) assigned to an AA’BB’ aromatic system. Signals of a trisubstituted aromatic ring containing one oxygenated carbon were observed at δH 8.00 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.14 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-5’), and 7.99 (dd, J 9.0; 2.5 Hz H-6’), along with doublets of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring containing three oxygenated carbons at δH 6.18 (J 2.5 Hz, H-6) and 6.45 (J 2.5 Hz, H-8). Analysis of the HMBC spectra evidenced correlations of the hydroxyl group with hydrogen bonded by cross peak at δH 13.09 (OH-5) with C-5” (δ 161.1), C-6” (δ 98.7), and C-10” (δ 103.6) and δH 12.96 (OH-5”) with C-5 (δ 162.1), C-6 (δ 98.9) and C-10 (δ 103.7), which are in agreement to those of amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987). Previous studies on 13C NMR data for amenthoﬂ avone derivative dimers indicated a close relationship between substituent effects and chemical shift for the inter-ﬂ avonoid linkage: a) amenthoﬂ avones; I-3’ (+ 6 ppm), II-8’’ (+ 10 ppm), b) dihydroamenthoﬂ avone; I-3’(+ 4 ppm), II-8” (+ 9 ppm), which can be diagnostic values in the recognition of new biﬂ avones in the amenthoﬂ avone series (Markhan, et al., 1987; Felício, et al., 2001). The values of 13C NMR spectra of 1-4 (Table 2) followed logically the average found to the series reported and indicated that O-methylation induced shifts that are in the same direction as those reported for monoﬂ avonoids (Markham, 1978). The biﬂ avonoids were assayed for cytotoxicity toward mouse lymphoma (L5178) and melanoma cancer cell line (KB) (Edrada et al., 1996). None of the compounds were active toward the cell line, however, they showed weak activity against the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and B. subitilis at the concentrations of 0.5 and 10 µg/mL (Table 3). The reference antibiotic, streptomycin sulfate, inhibited the growth of all bacterial species tested in this study at 5 µg/mL (zone inhibition = 30-35 mm). Compounds 1-4 also were submitted to preliminary TLC screening for selecting potential 323 Bioactive ﬂ avone dimers from Ouratea multiﬂ ora (Ochnaceae) Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J.

The antioxidant activities of biﬂ avones 1-4 were tested toward DPPH radical (Table 3) (Cardoso et al. 2004). Compound 4 showed moderate scavenging activity (IC50 18.5 µg/mL) in this test (So; Lewis, 2002), while 1-3 showed weak scavenging activity which conﬁ rms the dependence of antioxidant activity with the number of free aromatic hydroxyl groups of tested compounds.

ABSTRACT: The activity of crude extracts of three Rapanea species (Myrsinaceae) and Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Thirty-three extracts from different organs of these species were assayed and eleven of them showed significant activity (lysis % >50). The fractionation of an active extract from branches of R. lancifolia (99.5%) led to the isolation of two flavonoids: quercetin and taxifolin, which have weak trypanocidal activity. Additionally, one active extract from fruits of C. fruticosa (97.7%) afforded mexicanolide limonoids: cipadesin, mexicanolide, febrifugin and cipadesin A, that were slightly active on T. cruzi. Moreover, other two flavonoids (flavone and 7-methoxyflavone), previously assayed against T. cruzi, were isolated from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (100%). The results presented here suggest that the plants evaluated could be a source of new active compounds against T. cruzi.

It is caused by a flagellate protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted to humans by blood-sucking triatomine insects and by blood transfusion (WHO, 1997). With the control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans), infected blood transfusion is becoming the major cause for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). The only trypanocidal substance currently used to prevent the infection by this route is gentian violet, but its use is limited due to undesirable effects on the patients (Dias, 1993). The treatment of Chagas’ disease is still a challenge, since the only current available drug (benznidazole) has strong side effects (de Castro, 1993). Thus, the search for more efficient and less toxic drugs is needed to control this disease. In the past years, the study of compounds isolated from plants has received considerable attention in the search for alternative chemotherapy of parasitic diseases (Serrano et al., 2000) and many natural compounds have been identified as trypanocides (Duschak & Couto, 2007; 2 Guimarães & Faria, 2007). Several extracts from plants of Meliaceae and Rutaceae families have been showed in vitro activity against T. cruzi (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004; de Mesquita et al., 2005). Therefore, natural products constitute a promising source of new active compounds for treatment of Chagas’ disease. In this paper, we report the results of the evaluation of in vitro trypanocidal activity of 33 crude extracts from different organs of Rapanea lancifolia, R. guianensis, R. umbelata Myrsinaceae, and Cipadessa fruticosa Meliaceae. Moreover, it is showed the trypanocidal activity of flavonoids isolated from hexane extracts from branches of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa, as well the activity of four limonoids isolated from dichloromethane extract from fruits of C. fruticosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material Plants were collected in different states of Brazil and identified by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP and Dr. José Rubens Pirani from Department of Botany, USP, SP (Table 1).

Fernandes, Paulo C. Vieira, Maria F. das G. F. da Silva et al. giving four fractions. Fraction 4 was fractionated in the same conditions to yield compounds 1 (3.2 mg) and 2 (3.7 mg). The hexane extract (12.2 g) from branches of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 1524 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give nine fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1), affording nine fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2- MeOH (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 7 (16.7 mg) and 8 (8.2 mg). The dichloromethane extract from fruits (15.0 g) of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 180 g), was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, resulting in the fractions: hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:1); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1); EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Fractions CH2Cl2/ AcOEt (1:1) and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) were studied, as following described: the fraction CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1) (5.0 g) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography on silica gel using a gradient elution (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH), resulting in the four corresponding soluble fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (2.3 g) obtained from the last fractionation was several times chromatographed on silica gel and finally submitted to preparative HPLC to afford for limonoids 3 (19.4 mg), 5 (8.1 mg), and 6 (8.5 mg). Limonoid 4 (48.9 mg) was isolated from fraction EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) (4.6 g) of extract through several chromatographies on silica gel. Compounds 1-6 were identified through 1H and 13C NMR spectra, 1H - 1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC experiments and MS. The spectral data of 1 and 2 were in agreement with those published in the literature (Kuo et al., 1998; Moon et al., 2001) as well as the data of limonoids 3 (Luo et al., 2000), 4 (Paula, 1996), 5 (Govindachari & Kumari, 1998) and 6 (Leite et al. 2005a). Additionally, compounds 7 and 8 were characterized by comparison of 13C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975). The in vitro activity on T. cruzi of compounds 3 - 6 is described herein. On the other hand, the activities of compounds 1, 2, 7 and 8 were previously reported (Ambrozin et al., 2004; Tasdemir et al., 2006). Bioassay The bioassays were carried out according to the procedures described by Ambrozin et al. (2008). The activity of crude extracts was evaluated in triplicate at 4 mg/mL and pure substances at 250, 100, and 50 µg/ mL. It is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (µmol/L) for compounds 3-6 were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed against T. cruzi. The hexane extract (9.3 g) from branches of R. lancifolia (fresh weight: 1870 g) was fractionated through column chromatography on silica gel affording hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol fractions. The methanol fraction (1.5 g) was chromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, 3 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this work, we assessed the trypanocidal activity of 33 extracts of three Myrsinaceae and one Meliaceae species (Table 2). Eleven of them (33%) showed significant activity (lysis % > 50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. The majority of the extracts of C. fruticosa presented relevant activity. The best result was obtained from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH) that reduced 100% of the parasite number. The majority of the extracts of the three Rapanea species assayed did not present significant results, since several extracts led to the total lysis of the parasites and the red blood cells, as well. However, some extracts of these species showed high trypanocidal activity without affecting the red blood cells, such as the hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH). Similar studies involving the trypanocidal activity of Meliaceae and Rutaceae species have been reported by our group (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2008) showing that these plants can be considered a promising source of active compounds against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. Thus, the significant results obtained from the extracts of C. fruticosa are consistent with those previously reported for this family. The investigation of the methanol fraction of the active hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH) led to the isolation of the flavonol quercetin (1) Plant Plant part Solvent extraction Crude extract Lysis % Rapanea lancifolia (Myrsinaceae) hexane RLFLH 76.8 flowers dichloromethane RLFLD 72.2 methanol RLFLM TLa hexane RLLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RLLD TLa methanol RLLM TLa hexane RLBH 99.5 branches dichloromethane RLBD 7.0 methanol RLBM 47.69 hexane RGFLH TLa flowers dichloromethane RGFLD TLa methanol RGFLM TLa Rapanea guianensis (Myrsinaceae) hexane RGLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RGLD TLa methanol RGLM 68.5 hexane RGBH TLa branches dichloromethane RGBD TLa methanol RGBM 6.94 Hexane RUFRH TLa fruits dichloromethane RUFRD 69.4 Rapanea umbellata (Myrsinaceae) methanol RUFRM TLa hexane RURH TLa roots dichloromethane RURD TLa methanol RURM TLa hexane CFFRH 95.5 fruits dichloromethane CFFRD 97.7 methanol CFFRM 60.6 Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) Hexane CFLH 33.7 leaves dichloromethane CFLD 92.8 methanol CFLM 40.2 hexane CFBH 100 branches dichloromethane CFBD 76.1 methanol CFBM 42.0 Table 2.

Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Ana C. Leite, Artur Placeres Neto, Alessandra R. P. Ambrozin, João B. Fernandes, Paulo C. Vieira, Maria F. das G. F. da Silva et al. and the dihydrofl avonol taxifolin (2). Several biological activities have been reported for these fl avonoids. Quercetin (1), for example, presented antiprotozoal effect against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 = 14 µM), Trypanosoma brucei brucei (IC50 = 13.2 µM), Leishmania donovani (IC50 = 63.8 µM) (Camacho et al., 2002), T. brucei and T. rhodesiense (Williamson & Finnigan, 1978). In addition, this compound was described as a constituent of an aqueous extract from Lychnophora pinaster, Asteraceae which showed trypanocidal activity (Silveira et al., 2005). Recently, high leishmanicidal activity was described for such compound (Tasdemir et al., 2006). Compounds 1 and 2 were previously assayed on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, but showed low activity (Tasdemir et al., 2006). The relevant activity of the original extract (RLBH) is probably associated with the presence of other compounds or mixture of them. The mexicanolide limonoids 3-6, isolated from fruits of C. fruticosa, showed signifi cant trypanocidal activity (Table 3). They were obtained from the very active dichloromethane extract of fruits (Table 2, CFFRD, 97.7 %). This extract also afforded other limonoids (Leite et al., 2005a,b), which were not assayed herein. Recently, we reported the inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from T. cruzi. The results showed that crude extracts from C. fruticosa showed high ability to inhibit the enzyme activity (Leite et al., 2009). Thus, this specie could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against Chagas’ disease. In addition, the extracts from C. fruticosa showed high inhibition of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), a key enzyme from Leishmania that has been proposed as a target for the rational search of new leishmanicidal drugs (Ambrozin et al., 2005b). 5 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts The trypanocidal activity of flavone (7) and 7-methoxyflavone (8), isolated from the active hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH), was previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active fraction of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (Rutaceae), presented low activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (IC50 = 2116 and 787 µg/mL or 9531 and 1084 µmol/L, respectively) when compared with other flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004). Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites of C. fruticosa. As limonoids in the present work showed trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH extract may be associated with these compounds. Table 3.

The phytochemical study of three active extracts of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa led to the isolation of quercetin (1), taxifolin (2), flavone (7) and 7-methoxyflavone (8), which had showed weak activity against the trypomatigote forms of T. cruzi, and cipadesin (3), febrigufin (4), mexicanolide (5), and cipadesin A (6) that were appreciably actives. In addition, the trypanocidal activity of plants of Myrsinaceae family and limonoids 3-6 are been disclosed for the first time.

No contexto de nossas pesquisas por novos agentes antifúngicos obtidos da flora brasileira, oito extratos e doze frações de Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, foram submetidos ao ensaio antifúngico pelo método de microdiluição, contra quatro espécies de fungos oportunistas, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis e Cryptococcus neoformans. Este trabalho revelou que os extratos e frações de P. nitens foram mais ativos contra C. krusei e C. parapsilosis quando comparados a C. neoformans, sendo que o crescimento de C. albicans foi moderadamente afetado por todos os extratos e frações. As atividades mais potentes foram observadas para as frações n-butanólica dos galhos (CIM = 15,6 µg/mL) e raízes (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL) contra C. krusei. Adicionalmente, a fração n-butanólica dos galhos foi submetida ao fracionamento cromatográfico, resultando no isolamento de quatro alcaloides guanidínicos, sendo N-1,N-2,N-3-tri- isopentenilguanidina (1), descrito pela primeira vez em espécies da família Fabaceae e nitensidinas A-C (2-4), os quais apresentaram atividade antifúngica moderada contra C. krusei (CIM = 62,5 µg/ mL) e C. parapsilosis (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL). Unitermos: Pterogyne nitens, alcaloides guanidínicos, antifúngico, fungos oportunistas, Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans. ABSTRACT: As part of our ongoing research on antifungal agents from Brazilian flora, eight extracts and twelve fractions from Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were screened for antimicrobial activity against four opportunistic fungi species (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans) using a broth microdilution method. The present investigation reveals that P. nitens extracts and fractions were more effective against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis than against C. neoformans. The growth of C. albicans was moderately affected by all tested extracts and fractions. The strongest effects were observed for n-butanol fractions from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/mL) and roots (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL) against C. krusei. Additionally, the chromatographic fractionation of the n-butanol fraction from branches afforded four guanidine alkaloids; N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine (1), described for the first time in the Fabaceae family, and nitensidines A-C (2-4), which showed moderate activity towards C. krusei (MIC = 62.5 µg/mL) and C. parapsilosis (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL).

INTRODUCTION The clinical relevance of opportunistic fungal infections have increased at an alarming rate in the second half of the twentyth century, including individuals infected with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer (Clark & Hajjeh, 2002; Hage et al., 2002). The most frequent causing agents of such infections are Candida, Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor and some unusual genera such as Fusarium, Trichosporon, 707 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(5): Out./Nov. 2010 Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi and Scedosporium (Guarro et al., 2006; Nucci & Anaissie, 2007). Furthermore, the most common treatment for these infectious diseases involves azoles and polyene macrolides, which are limited in their spectrum, and presenting severe side effects (Helmerhorst et al., 1999). For this reason, there is a need for new antifungal compounds which can serve as lead compounds for further development in antifungal chemotherapy. In this way, plants have been proven to be a rich source of antimicrobial agents (Vieira et al., 2005, Alves et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2006; Sena Filho et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007; Batista-Júnior et al., 2008; Cardoso-Lopes et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2008; Tempone et al., 2008; Bertucci et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2009a; Silva-Júnior et al., 2009). Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, is popularly named in South America as “tipa”, “yvi-raró”, “cocal”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” and “amendoim-bravo” according to the region where this plant grows. It is a sole beautiful legume tree from Pterogyne genus, which is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, reaching 5-12 m height (Burkart, 1952; Lorenzi, 1998). Cold aqueous preparations using stem barks has been used as folk medicine for treating of ascaridiasis (Crivos, 2007). Previous chemical and biological studies have demonstrated the presence of guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity against to human cancer cell lines (Bolzani et al., 1995; Ferreira et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2007, 2009b,c) and phenolics with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging activities (Fernandes et al., 2008; Regasini et al., 2008a,b,c; Souza et al., 2009; Souza et al., 2010). Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of extracts and fractions from branches, green fruits, roots and stem barks and isolated terpene guanidine alkaloids from P. nitens against four opportunistic human yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans), by using broth microdilution test. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material Roots, branches, green fruits and stem barks of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil) by Ph.D. Maria C. M. Young in January 2005 and identified by Ph.D. Inês Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP 204319b) was deposited at the State Herbarium \"Maria Eneida Kaufmann\" of Institute of Botany (São Paulo, Brazil). Extraction The powdered shade-dried plant material was extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane and, subsequently with ethanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation yielding a thick syrup. The crude ethanol extracts were further reconstituted in methanol-water (7:3) and then partitioned with ethyl acetate and n-butanol, successively. Samples from hexane and ethanol extracts, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and lyophilized hydroalcoholic fractions, were submitted to antimicrobial tests. Isolation of antifungal compounds 1-4 The n-butanol fraction (2.5 g) from the ethanol extract of branches was subjected to gel permeation column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol to afford nine fractions (B1-B9), which were combined after comparison of their TLC profile [chloroform:methanol (9:1)] revealed with Dragendorff´s reagent. The alkaloidal fraction (B2, 587 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase C-18 silica gel CC eluted with acetonitrile:water gradient that afforded eight fractions (ALK1-ALK8). Purification of fraction ALK5 (121 mg) by repeated CC over silica gel (230-400 mesh) eluted with chloroform:methanol in a gradient ranging from 0 to 35% methanol, furnished N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine (1, 7 mg) and nitensidine B (3, 12 mg). Fraction ALK-8 (88 mg) was subject to preparative TLC developed with ch loroform:methanol:triethylamine (87:12.5:0.5), developed three times to yield nitensidine A (2, 7 mg) and nitensidine C (4, 3 mg). The molecular structures of these guanidine alkaloids were identified through 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS data. The spectral data were in agreement with those published in the literature (Bolzani et al., 1995; Conegero et al., 2003). N N N H H N H H N NH N H N NH H N Me Me N NH 1 2 3 4 708 Rev. Bras.

Microorganisms and growth conditions The test organisms C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. krusei ATCC 6258, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and C. neoformans ATCC 90012 were originally obtained from the Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at São Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 to 48 h at room temperature. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing The antifungal activity tests were performed using broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications (Rodriguez- Tudela et al., 2003). The medium used was RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. Samples were diluted in DMSO and each well of a 96-well U-bottomed culture plate were added 100 µL culture together with 100 µL of 2-fold serial diluted test compound. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be 1 x 105 to 5 x 105 CFU/mL. This suspension was inoculated on the microdilution plate previously prepared with the extracts, fractions and compounds 1-4 diluted at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL. The plates were incubated with agitation at 37 °C for 24 h for Candida spp. and 48 h for C. neoformans. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were used as positive controls exhibiting a MIC value ranging from 2.00 to 0.06 and 64.00 to 2.00 µg/mL (Table 1). The MIC values were calculated as the lowest concentration of the test samples which shows complete growth inhibition of the fungi strains. Results were analyzed visually and spectrophotometrically. All assays were performed in triplicate. The extracts and fractions showing a MIC lower than 100, ranging from 100-500, 500-1000 and over 1000 µg/mL were considered potent, moderated, weak and not active, respectively (Holetz et al., 2002). Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) All tested samples in antifungal study showing MIC<1000 µg/mL, were transferred to plates of Sabouraud- dextrose agar. The plates were incubated at 35 oC for 48 h (yeast). The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that did not permit any visible fungal colony growth on the appropriate agar plate after the period of incubation. All assays were performed in triplicate. RESULTS In this work, eight extracts and twelve fractions as well as four guanidine alkaloids (1-4) were tested at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL against four human opportunistic yeasts (C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. neoformans). These results were summarized in Table 1. All extracts and fractions from Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were weakly active against the yeast C. albicans with MIC values ranging from 1000 to 250 µg/ mL, which were considered moderate to weak according to Holetz et al. (2002). The hexane extract from roots was not active to C. albicans and C. neoformans (MIC>1000 µg/mL). The extracts and fractions from roots and green fruits demonstrated moderate activity against C. krusei, except the n-butanol fraction from roots, which presented strong activity (MIC 31.2 µg/mL) against this yeast. Additionally, branches and stem barks exhibited potent activity against C. krusei with MIC values ranging from 15.6 to 62.5 µg/mL and the best result was observed for the n-butanol fraction from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/ mL). Furthermore the hexane extracts and hydroalcoholic fractions from branches and stem barks showed moderate to weak activity against this yeast. All the samples had weak to moderate activity against C. parapsilosis and C. neoformans, except for the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions from stem barks, which exhibited potent inhibition of C. parapsilosis (MIC = 62.5 µg/mL). Compounds 1-4 isolated from n-butanol fraction of branches from P. nitens inhibits the growth of opportunistic fungi with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.2 μg/ mL against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, respectively. Additionally, minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of all extracts, fractions and guanidine alkaloids (1-4) were also evaluated against the four yeasts and showed MFC values higher than 1000 µg/mL, indicating a fungistatic behavior. DISCUSSION Several Fabaceae species have been evaluated for their antifungal properties (Scorzoni et al., 2007) among them Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, a typical leguminous plant from Brazilian flora has been studied for antimicrobial activity. Previous biological studies have demonstrated that extracts from the barks of P. nitens did not show antibacterial activity (Salvat et al., 2001). The bioactivity presented for compounds 1-4 indicated that antifungal activity observed in the extracts and fractions may be at least partially due to guanidine alkaloids. It was also observed that the strongest antifungal effects of the tested samples were on strains of C. krusei and C. parapsilosis when compared with C. albicans and C. neoformans. P. nitens and isolated compounds displayed 709 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(5): Out./Nov. 2010 Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi activity against C. krusei, which is very significant because this yeast has natural resistance against commercial drug fluconazole (Rex et al., 1995), suggesting its potential application for treating C. krusei infections, considering a possible mode of action different from those azole drugs. The current study suggests that P. nitens have antimicrobial activity against opportunistic yeasts. Therefore, it could be an important source of antifungal compounds which can be useful for developing new lead compounds, including compound 1, which was described for the first time in the Fabaceae family. Further chemical and pharmacological investigations are thus needed in order to isolate and identify additional constituents and establish the potential mechanisms of action.

Their structures were established based on their spectral data, and for the new compounds these data are described herein. Additionally, these compounds were assayed on the tripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi showing moderate trypanocidal activity. Keywords: Almeidea rubra, Rutaceae, alkaloids, trypanocidal activity Introduction The genus Almeidea belongs to Rutaceae family and is widely distributed in Brazil. Data about the secondary metabolites of this genus are available. From Almeidea guyanensis was isolated C-arabinosyl flavones, 2- and 4- quinolones, and flavone C-glycosides.1 We have previously reported the isolation of triterpenoids, acridone, 2-quinolone, and furoquinoline alkaloids, and a new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid from A. coeruela and A. rubra2 besides steroids, one sesquiterpene, one cromone, and one flavone.3 Chagas’ disease (American Trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affecting more than 18 million people in Latin America.4 Its treatment is still a challenge and new less toxic and more effective drugs are necessary. As a part of our search for new trypanocidal compounds and our studies on the chemistry of Rutaceae, a new specimen of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. was investigated. Thus, here we report the isolation, identification and characterization of two new substances (1 and 2a) and seven known compounds (3-9) from methanol extract of leaves of this plant, in addition to their trypanocidal activities. Results and Discussion The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of 435 New Pyrone and Quinoline Alkaloid from Almeidea rubra and their Trypanocidal Activity Vol. 16, No. 3A, 2005 methanol extract from leaves of A. rubra afforded two new compounds (1 and 2a) and known compounds (Figure 1) arborinine (3), N-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone (4),5 skimmianine (5),6 kokusagine (6),7 isodutaduprine (7),8 isoskimmianine (8), and isokokusagine (9), which were identified through comparison of their NMR spectral data with the literature. Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow powder and its structure was determined by analysis of NMR and LRMS. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed aromatic protons at δ 7.33 (2H, m), and 6.70 (2H, m), assigned to H-4’, H-6’, and H-3’, H5’, respectively. Two olefinic protons (H-3 and H-5) appeared at δ 5.49, and 6.23 (d, J 2.2 Hz) assigned to an 2- pyrone by comparison with a styryl-2-pyrone described by Pizzolatti et al.,9 besides broad N-H and N-CH3 signals at δ 5.36, and 2.87. Furthermore, a singlet at δ 3.85 (3H) revealed the presence of the methoxyl group in the molecule. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 13 carbons, distinguished as 5 quaternaries (δ 171.7, 164.0, 162.8, 147.6, 116.0), 4 aromatics (δ 132.3, 129.2, 116.4, 111.2), 2 ofelinics (δ 100.1, 87.3), 1 methoxyl (δ 55.9), and 1 N- methyl carbon (δ 30.4). The analysis of 13C NMR and HSQC spectrum allowed us to attribute undoubtedly all chemical shifts to methyl, vinyl, and aromatic carbons/ hydrogens of 1 (Table 1). The assignments of quaternary carbons were possible from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-2’ was deduced from 3J correlation between N-CH3 hydrogens (δ 2.87) and one carbon at δ 147.6. C-4 (δ 171.7) was assigned through 3J correlation between the lowerfield carbon and methoxyl hydrogens (δ 3.85). Furthermore, C-6 (δ 162.8) and C-1’ (δ 116.0) were determined through 2J-3J correlation to H-5 (δ 6.23). Finally, through the 2J correlation between H-3 (δ 5.49) and a carbonyl carbon at δ 164.0 was attributed C-2. All these results allowed us to propose the structure 4- methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one for compound 1, which is described for the first time in the literature and represents a new class of compounds formed by the reaction of anthranilic acid and two acetyl/malonyl- CoA units. Single crystal X-ray diffraction established undoubtedly the structure of 1 as a derivative of anthranilic acid (Figure 2). The crystal structure of compound 1 shows the presence of two independent molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure 2). The main conformational difference between both independent molecules is centered in the dihedral angle between the least square planes that pass through the aromatic rings in each molecule. The value of this angle in molecule 1 is 33.58(8)° and in molecule 2 is 34.79(8)°. The crystal structure also shows the presence of one intramolecular interaction in each molecule. These interactions are slightly different due to the conformation Figure 1. Compounds isolated from Almeidea rubra. Table 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. changes. The analyses of the crystal packing show the presence of four intermolecular interactions of the type C- H…O that give rise to the formation of chains along the (101) direction. These chains are connected with the chain just above and below it through three intermolecular interactions of the N-H…O type. The quinoline and acridine alkaloids, which are widely distributed in Rutaceae, arise from combination of anthranilic acid and acetate/malonate.10 In these cases, the ciclization takes place by nucleophilic attack of nitrogen atom to the carboxyl carbon. However, compound 1 should be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom to the carboxyl carbon, giving rise an α-pyrone. We have previously reported the isolation of the new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid 2b (Figure 1) from A. coerulea.2 Reinvestigation of A. rubra afforded an alkaloid 2a whose spectral data seem to be very similar to those of 2b. This alkaloid was isolated as a white powder and identified by NMR and LRMS. The molecular formula C20H25NO6 of 2a was defined by elemental analysis. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2a were observed a pair of doublets (J 2.6 Hz) at δ 7.58 and 6.97, and a singlet at δ 4.30, which indicate that 2a was a tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid. The signals at δ 2.78, 2.20, and 2.01, assigned to H-5, and H-6, respectively, confirmed that 2a had a reduced furoquinoline ring. 1H NMR spectrum of 2a also showed two singlets at δ 3.14, and 2.03, and a group of signals at δ 6.06 (d, J 16.1 Hz), 5.69 (d, J 16.1 Hz), 1.34 (s), and 1.31 (s), which indicated the presence of the 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent. Through the spectral data comparison, it was established that 2a distinguished from 2b by the presence of 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent instead of γ,γ-dimethylallyl moiety. Analysis of HSQC correlations and literature data2 allowed us to attribute undoubtedly chemical shifts to methyl, methylene, vinyl, furanyl hydrogen/carbon of 2a (Table 2). The assignments of quaternary carbons of 2a were made from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-4 was deduced from 3J correlation between methoxyl hydrogens at C-4 (δ 4.30) and one carbon at δ 158.2. The correlation of the other methoxyl hydrogens (δ 3.14) and one carbon at δ 79.7 determined Figure 2. ORTEP-3 diagram of compound 1. Table 2.

C-4a was assigned through correlation between the carbon at δ 117.6 and H-5, and H-6 (δ 2.78, and 2.01). H-5 also correlated to C-8a (δ 150.0). Furthermore, methyl hydrogens at δ 1.34, and 1.31, correlated with an oxygenated carbon at δ 70.8, establishing C-3”. Finally, the correlation between furanyl hydrogens (δ 7.58, and 6.97) and quaternary carbons at δ 162.7, and 105.2 determined C-2, and C-3, respectively. The close similarity between the chemical shifts observed for carbons of reduced furoquinoline ring when compared with the model compound 7-O-acetylha- plophyllidine (2b)2 led us to suggest a trans relationship between the 7-acetoxy and 8-methoxy groups. Alkaloid 2a, rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]- 4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro [2,3-b]quinoline-7- yl acetate, is described for the first time in the literature, and the occurrence of tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid such as 2a and 2b seems to be restricted to the genera Almeidea and Haplophyllum of Rutaceae family.2,11 In order to improve the therapy of Chagas disease, we have been studying species of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, Burseraceae, and Cneoraceae) aiming to isolate hit compounds that could be used in the development of new antichagasic drugs. Compounds described in this paper were isolated from an active fraction of A. rubra (62.9% lysis – percent reduction of the parasite number) on the tripomastigote forms of T. cruzi.12 Their in vitro trypanocidal actions are shown on Table 3. Three of them (7-9) could not be assayed due to their instability. The results showed that all of compounds had moderate trypanocidal actions and kokusagine (6) was the most active one. Probably, they are responsible by the activity of the A. rubra fraction.12 However, they could not be considered good prototype for the development of new antichagasic drugs, mainly when their activities are compared with crystal violet and some lignans also isolated from other Rutaceae.13 Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using either Bruker DRX-200 and ARX- 400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Low resolution EIMS were recorded on GC-17A, GCMS-QP5000 Shimadzu. Plant material The leaves of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. were collected in May 2000 in Espírito Santo State, southeast of Brazil. The plant material was identified by Dr. José Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani et al. 4746) was deposited at the Herbarium of that Department. Extraction and isolation Dried leaves (313.5 g) were extracted first with hexane and then with MeOH at room temp. Part of the methanol extract (15.9 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel 60 (70- 230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield the corresponding fractions (ALFMH, ALFMD, ALFMA, ALFMM). The fraction ALFMA (3.3208 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 410 x 43 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give eleven fractions. The second fraction (ALFMA2; 0.6302 g) was chromatographed on silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 358 x 31 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:AcOEt 8:2→MeOH) to afford ten fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) from the fraction five (ALFMA2,5; 103.6 mg) was obtained four fractions. Then, the second fraction (ALFMA2,5,2; 68.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2→MeOH gradient) to give four fractions. The third fraction (ALFMA2,5,2,3; 36.0 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (1:1) to afford six fractions. Through column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2→MeOH gradient) of the fraction five (ALFMA2,5,2,3,5; 14.3 mg) was isolated the alkaloid 2a (2.6 mg). Fraction four (ALFMA4; 178.1 mg) was chroma- tographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) Table 3.

Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) of the third fraction (ALFMA4,3; 59.9 mg) was obtained the alkaloid 5 (ALFMA4,3,7; 2.5 mg) and eight fractions. Then, the fourth fraction (ALFMA4,3,4; 2.3 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (332 x 25 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) to give three fractions. Further purification of the fraction two (ALFMA4,3,4,2; 2.0 mg) on preparative planar silica plate with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) afforded alkaloid 6 (1.6 mg). Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH) of the fraction five (ALFMA4,3,5; 21.5 mg) was isolated the compound 1 (14.7 mg). The alkaloids arborinine (3) (43.2 mg), isodutaduprine (7) (25.6 mg), and isoskimmianine (8) (28.8 mg) were crystallized in MeOH from fraction six (ALFMA6; 104.5 mg), seven (ALFMA7; 317.3 mg) and nine (ALFMA9; 120.5 mg), respectively. The other alkaloid isokokusagine (9) (32.1 mg) was purified on sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH) from fraction eight (ALFMA8; 90.3 mg), and the alkaloid 4 (3.2 mg) was obtained from fraction three (148.8 mg). 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one (1) Yellow powder; elemental analysis (Found: C, 68.0432; H, 5.565904; N, 6.11885.

Single crystal X-ray analysis Low temperature X-ray diffraction data collection was performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 50° in 2θ, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;14 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.15 No absorption corrections were applied. The structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.16 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.17 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. The programs SHELXL-97,17 and ORTEP-318 were used within WinGX19 to prepare materials for publication. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles, and thermal parameters have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. The supplementary crystallographic data have been sent in electronic format to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, as CIF file No. CCDC 242119.

Trypanocidal activity in vitro As described by Ambrozin et al.,12 the bioassays were carried out using blood of infected Swiss albino mice, which was collected by cardiac puncture at the peak of parasitemic infection (7th day of infection for Y strain of T. cruzi). The infected blood was diluted with healthy mice blood to achieve a concentration of 2.106 forms/mL. Solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The activities of substances were evaluated at 500, 250, and 100 µg/mL. The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) which contained 400 µL mixture/ well. The plates were incubated at 4 oC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h, following the method described by Brener.20 Infected blood with the same volume of DMSO was used as control, and gentian violet to a concentration of 250 µg/mL was used as positive control. The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 values were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

Cardoso, Dulce H. S. Silva, Ian Castro-Gamboa and Vanderlan da S. Bolzani* Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista CP 355, 14800-900 Araraquara-SP, Brazil Um novo biflavonol denominado chimarrosídeo (1) e oito flavonóis glicosilados adicionais (2-9) foram isolados das folhas de Chimarrhis turbinata. Suas estruturas foram elucidadas com base nos dados dos experimentos de RMN 1D e 2D, como: 3-O-rutinosilquercetina (2), 3-O- rutinosil-kaempferol (3), 3-O-galactopiranosil-(6→1)-ramnopiranosil kaempferol (4), 3-O-β- galactopiranosil-(6→1)-α-ramnopiranosil-quercetina (5), 6-hidroxirutina (6), 3-O- galactopiranosil-kaempferol (7), 3-O-glucopiranosil-kaempferol (8) e 3-O-ramnopiranosil- (6→1)-glucopiranosil-(4→1)-ramnopiranosil-kaempferol (9). Adicionalmente, a catequina (10) e a procianidina B-3 (catequina-(4α→8)-catequina) (11) também foram isoladas. O extrato bruto, frações e compostos isolados foram avaliados quanto às suas propriedades antioxidantes no teste em CCD aspergida com solução de β-caroteno, e teste espectrofotométrico utilizando o radical livre 1,1-difenil-2-picrilidrazila (DPPH). Os flavonóides 2, 5, 6, 10 e 11 apresentaram forte atividade antioxidante quando comparados com os padrões BHT e rutina. A new biflavonol, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonol glycosides (2-9), were isolated from the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata. Their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (4), quercetin-3-O- α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (5), 6-hydroxy-rutin (6), kaempferol-3- O-D-galactopyranoside (7), kaempferol-3-O-D-glucopyranoside (8) and kaempferol-3-O-α-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranoside (9). In addition, catechin (10) and catechin-(4α→8)-catechin-procyanidin B-3) (11) were isolated. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative properties using an autographic assay based on β-carotene bleaching on TLC plates, and spectrophotometric detection by reduction of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Flavonoids 2, 5, 6, 10 and 11 displayed strong free radical scavenging activity, when compared with the standards BHT and rutin. Keywords: Rubiaceae, chimarrhoside, DPPH, β-carotene Introduction In recent years, flavonoids have been widely recognized as a major class of secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties due to their ability to scavenge free radicals.1-3 Antioxidant is a broad classification for molecules that may act prior to, or during, a free radical chain reaction at initiation, propagation, termination, decomposition, or subsequent reaction of oxidation products as sensitive targets.4 There are several diseases, whose causes and severity are linked to oxidation, mainly those associated with oxygen free radicals, which have been implicated as mediators of degenerative and chronic deteriorative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases,5 such as rheumatoid arthritis,6 diabetes, vascular disease and hypertension, cancer and hyperplasic diseases,7 cataract formation and aging processes.8 Radical-mediated pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion, asthma and many others involving an imbalance in pro-oxidant- antioxidant processes.9 In our search for antioxidant compounds from Amazonian plant species, we examined constituents of Chimarrhis turbinata DC Rodr.. (Rubiaceae) leaves, collected in the city of Belém, Pará State, Brazil. The chemical composition of C. turbinata has been studied previously, and bioactive indole alkaloids were identified.10-12 In this paper, we describe the isolation 1354 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. of a new biflavonoid, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant effects, which were deduced by electrochemical detection coupled to an HPLC system, bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates, and parameters related to the evaluation of antioxidant activity measured by free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl). Results and Discussion Chimarrhoside (1) was obtained as an amorphous pale yellow powder from the EtOH extract and exhibited in its mass spectrum a molecular ion peak at m/z 1171 [M+H]+ obtained from ESIMS. The IR and UV spectra of 1 revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (270, 295, 344 nm, 1690 cm-1). Part of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of compound 1 were observed in duplicate, suggesting a dimer (Table 1). Comparison of the 13C NMR values of 1 with literature data13 evidenced the kaempferol aglycone and additional similar spectral features to those of 3, also isolated in this work, except for the duplication of some signals for carbons arising from a dimer structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 1, signals for two kaempferol units as two meta-coupled A-ring hydrogens (H-6/H-8) and two pairs of coupled B-ring hydrogens (H-3'/H-5' and H-2'/H-6') for each aglycone were observed, in addition to four anomeric hydrogens at δ 5.12 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 5.02 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 4.40 (1H, br s), 4.60 (1H, br s), 20 hydroxymethine and 2 hydroxymethylene hydrogens. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of two kaempferol moieties and 24 hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene signals which, analyzed together with 1H NMR data (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of two diglycoside moieties identified as rutinosyl and α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- (1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. This assumption was supported by signals at δ 103.1 / 67.1 and δ 104.0 / 65.9, assigned to C-1'’ C-6'’ of the glucopyranosyl and of the galactopyranosyl moiety respectively. Those signals also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’ (anomeric) and H-6'’ (Table 1); as well as signals at δ 100.9/16.4 and δ 100.4/16.6, assigned to C-1’’’/C-6’’’ of the two rhamnopyranosil moieties, respectively, which also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’’ (δ 4.4 0 and 4.60) and H-6’’’ (δ 1.17 and 1.11). On the basis of the above data, the chemical shifts assigned for each sugar: the glucosyl and galactosyl moieties were confirmed taking into account the values at δ 103.1, 76.6, 75.7, 74.3, 70.1 and 67.1 as well as δ 104.0, 73.9, 73.6, 71.5, 68.2 and 65.9 attributed to glucose and galactose, respectively.15 According to literature data, using the same solvent, the chemical shifts of hydroxymethines carbons in glucose are quite deshielded when compared to those of galactose. The glucosyl/galactosyl groups are linked to the rhamnosyl residue at C-6”, because the signal assigned to this carbon, in both sugar moieties, was markedly displaced downfield at δ 67.1/65.9 (∆δ +6), respectively when compared with the 13C NMR spectrum of free hydroxymethylenes in glucose/galactose. This also was confirmed by the observation of a HMBC long-range correlation of the anomeric hydrogen signal of the rhamnosyl group at δ 4.40 / 4.60 with C-6” of the glucosyl moieties at 67.1 and 65.9, respectively. Additionally, the site of glycosylation at C-3 of each kaempferol moiety was evidenced from downfield shifts of C-2 (∆δ +9) and C-4 (∆δ +2) and upfield shift of C-3 (∆δ -3) when compared to the aglycone,15 as well as from HMBC correlations of H-1'’ to C-3a/3b within each kaempferol diglycoside moiety (Figure 1). Further HMBC correlations of H-6 and H-8 with C-7 (δ 164.6) confirmed the assignments for ring A and suggested the interflavonoidic linkage at C-7 due to the observed downfield shift of its signal when compared to the monomer.15 Moreover, ESIMS analysis showed peaks of m/z 298 (70) and 133 (40) resulting from Retro Diels- Alder (RDA) fragmentations. From moiety A wherein bonds 1 and 3 undergo scission, lead to formation of ions I and II as well as scission of bonds 0 and 2 led to the formation of fragment m/z 433 (30). The fragment m/z 298 (70), was generated by both RDA suffered by moiety A and moiety B (Figure 2). Additional fragments observed in the mass spectra are in accordance with those reported for kaempferol.16 These data, combined with HPLC analysis, which showed a lower retention time for compound 1 (5.7 min) when compared to monomeric flavonol diglycosides 2 (9.8 min) and 3 (13.8 min.) (Figure 3), confirmed the proposed structure for compound 1 as kaempferol 3-O-β-rutinosyl-(7α→O→7β)-kaempferol-3- O-β-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. Further studies of the EtOAc extract from leaves of C. turbinata resulted in 10 known flavonoids already reported in the literature: Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol- 3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamno- Figure 1.

These compounds were identified and their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments and compared with literature data (Figure 4).13-15, 18, 19-22, 26-28 The radical scavenging effects obtained for compounds 2-11 assayed with DPPH are shown in (Table 2) using as reference the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 21.34 μg mL-1) and BHT (IC50 62.50 μg mL-1). These results indicate that the free-radical scavenging activity of these 1356 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. micromolecules is due to its hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the ease of stabilization of the phenoxyl radical after reduction of DPPH and is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by the IC50 values for compounds 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11.24 It is also evident from Table 2, that ortho-dihydroxy moiety plays more important role for this type of activity than the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, as the lack of the latter, e.g. in compound 10, contributed in a lesser extent to the loss of activity, as observed for compounds 3, 4 and 7-9, due to the missing catechol group.

Experimental General experimental procedures Commercial β-carotene (Aldrich) and DPPH (Aldrich) were used in the antioxidant assays. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C and referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance (CD3OD at δ 3.33 and 49.0 for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR-Nicolet, model EMACT-40 Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer, in the range 500-4000 cm-1. ESIMS spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10-20 eV with argon. Silica gel 60H (230-400 μ), (60-230 μ) (Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) and XAD-16 (Sigma) were used in column chromatography. TLC plates were illuminated under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. For preparative HPLC, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, ODS Phenomenex,, Luna column (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 μm), and pre-Column (50 x 10.00 mm) were used in this study. For semi-preparative HPLC, a Supelco ODS column 8 (250 mm x 10 mm x 5 μm) was used. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All EIMS spectra were obtained by direct insertion of the samples, using an electric cone potential of +70 eV. Plant material Leaves from C. turbinata DC Rodr. were collected at the Viro Reserve, in the State of Pará, in October 1996 and February 2000. Dr. Inês Cordeiro identified the specimen, and a voucher No. Cord-2367 was deposited in the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanic Garden, São Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation C. turbinata were collected twice, and the plant material obtained (1.0 kg), were dried, powdered and extracted with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) and EtOH, successively, affording extracts A and B, respectively, after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. Extract B was dissolved in MeOH:H2O (80:20) and partitioned with hexane. The hydroalcoholic fraction was partially evaporated to MeOH:H2O (60:40), and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. All fractions were preliminarily screened with β-carotene solution on TLC for antioxidant compounds. The EtOAc fraction (1.0 g after solvent evaporation) was dissolved in MeOH (5.0 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-1 to A-12. Fraction A-5 (160.0 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with MeOH and the obtained subfractions were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-5-I, A-5-II and A-5-III. Fraction A-5-II was purified by HPLC [Phenomenex ODS, 250 x 21.2 mm, 10 μm; eluent: MeOH-H2O (2:3, v/v); 12.0 mL min-1; UV detection at 280 nm] affording compounds 2 (7.0 mg), 3 (16.0 mg) and 4 (12.0 mg). Fraction A-6 (63.1 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over9 Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-6-I, A-6-II and A-6-III. Fraction A-6-I (25.0 mg) was purified by LC over polivinylpirrolidone (PVPP)25 eluted with MeOH affording the new compound 1 (2.6 mg). Leaves of C. turbinata (powdered and air-dried material 1.2 kg) obtained from the second collection were extracted exhaustively with EtOH at room temperature. The EtOH solutions were evaporated under vacuum to give a residue (57.1 g). This residue was dissolved in EtOH:H2O (90:10), and then extracted with n-hexane to give a n-hexane fraction (28.9 g). The EtOH:H2O fraction was extracted with CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH successively, to give a CH2Cl2 fraction (4.0 g), EtOAc fraction (4.1 g), n-BuOH fraction (12.4 g) and H2O-soluble residues (7.6 g), respectively, which were screened by β-carotene test on TLC.

Subfraction 8 was identified as compound 4 (80.0 mg). Subfraction 9 (10.0 mg) was purified by semipreparative HPLC [MeCN:H2O 20:80), 1.0 mL min-1, UV detection at 280 nm] to afford compound 7 (6.1 mg).

Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background was observed. The persisting yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.17 Determination of the radical scavenging activity 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was used in methanol (100 μmol L-1). 2. 0 mL of the reagent was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds, previously dissolved in methanol, with yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 and 5 μmol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and maintained for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin and BHT were used as standard compounds. DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in methanol (1.0 mL) served as control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer at 517 nm and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH treated control group.

O último foi anteriormente isolado dos caules, porém sua configuração relativa não foi resolvida por experimentos de RMN. Este trabalho apresenta a análise de difração de raios-X da epoxi-fraxinelona, descreve o isolamento da fraxinelonona e fraxinelona pela primeira vez em Raulinoa, e a atividade tóxica da primeira sobre formigas cortadeiras (Atta sexdens rubropilosa). Pouca atividade foi observada para o limonóide degradado testado; entretanto, o limonóide ácido limonéxico isolado dos caules, apresentou alta toxicidade contra as formigas cortadeiras, reduzindo consideravelmente a longevidade das mesmas, em comparação com o controle. Phytochemical survey of roots extracts of the South Brazilian endemic plant Raulinoa echinata Cowan, Rutaceae led to the isolation of known degraded limonoids: fraxinellone, fraxinellonone and epoxy-fraxinellone. The latter was previously isolated also from the stems, but the relative configuration could not be solved by NMR experiments. This paper deals with the X-ray diffraction analysis of epoxy-fraxinellone and its toxicity to leaf-cutting ants, describes the isolation of fraxinellonone and fraxinellone for the first time in Raulinoa. Epoxy-fraxinellone showed no toxicity to the leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens rubropilosa). The limonoid limonexic acid, isolated from stems, presented high toxicity to the leaf-cutting ants, diminishing considerably their longevity. Keywords: Raulinoa echinata, degraded limonoids, limonexic acid, Atta sexdens rubropilosa, X-ray structure Introduction Raulinoa is a monospecific genus and the species Raulinoa echinata Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic in the Itajaí Valley, SC, Brazil.1 This endangered perennial woody shrub is characterized by the presence of spines (popularly know as Cutia-de-espinho) and has only been found in a short interval (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks of Itajaí river in an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing a high degree of adaptation to the environment. We have previously reported the isolation and biological activities of some compounds of R. echinata.2 In continuation of our search for compounds and natural products to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants, we have investigated the hexane extracts of roots of R. echinata leading to the isolation of typical rutaceous degraded limonoids: fraxinellone (1), fraxinellonone (2) and new epoxy-fraxinellone (3). The extracts of the stems furnished the known limonin precursor, limonexic acid (4). Leaf-cutting ants are one of the most serious agricultural pests in South American countries and the biological control of these insects has been the aim of many studies. Their control can be achieved by means of intoxicating the leaf-cutting ants3 or inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus. In this paper we describe the isolation, structural determination and evaluation of the activity of degraded 1444 Biavatti et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. limonoids and limonoids as toxicants to the leaf-cutting ants Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Experimental General experimental procedures NMR spectra: a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C was used.2 All spectra were run in CDCl3 using TMS as internal standard. Single crystal X-ray analysis Low temperature X-ray diffraction data collection was performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 52.7° in 2θ, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;4 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.5 No absorption corrections were applied. The structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.6 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.7 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. Data collections and experimental details for the complexes are summarized in Table 1. The programs SHELXL-97,7 and ORTEP-38 were used within WinGX9 to prepare materials for publication. Data collections and experimental details for compound 3 are summarized in Table 1. Plant material Roots of R. echinata were collected in Ressacada, Ibirama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade de São Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited at the Herbário Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of compounds The dried and powdered roots (397 g) were extracted with hexane (4 g) and MeOH (20 g). Successively, the hexane extract was fractionated over silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) into three fractions: hexane, EtOAc and MeOH. The hexane sub-fraction (576 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (9:1 and gradient) to furnish the compounds (in eluting order): fraxinellone (1) (37.1 mg), epoxy-fraxinellone (3) (76 mg), and the fraction named E (30 mg), that was rechromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (99:1 and gradient) to afford fraxinellonone (2) (6 mg). The methanol extract of the stems (80 g) was partitioned with dichloromethane (yielding 9 g) then chromatographed over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using as eluent hexane-acetone (9:1 and gradient), furnishing 17 sub-fractions (A-P). Sub- fractions D-G (4.1 g) were grouped and chromatographed over silica gel and hexane-acetone (9:1 and gradient) as eluent, originating sub-fractions A-T. The sub-fraction T (1.2 g) was purified by preparative TLC using hexane- benzene (1:1), yielding 650 mg of limonexic acid (4). Identification of the isolated compounds The isolated degraded limonoids fraxinellone10,11,12 (1), fraxinellonone10,11,12 (2), epoxy-fraxinellone13 (3) and limonexic acid13 (4) presented spectral data in agreement with the literature. epoxy-fraxinellone (3). 5-Furan-3-yl-1a,4a-dimethyl- hexahydro-1,6-dioxa-cyclopropa[d]inden-7-one, [α]D – 22.5o (c 0.02, CH2Cl2).

(1997).14 Each treatment consisted of 50 ants distributed in 5 Petri dishes. The leaf-cutting ants were isolated from their nest and fed with an artificial diet. The ants from the treatment received a diet added with epoxy-fraxinellone or limonexic acid, at a concentration of 200 μg. The ants from the control treatment were fed with a diet without this compound. During 25 days, the number of dead ants for each Petri dish was counted and a new portion of artificial diet given. It was estimated the survival curve of leaf-cutting ants of each treatment and calculated the median longevity. The test used for the statistic analyze of data was the Log rank-test (α=0.05). Results and Discussion The isolated degraded limonoids 1-3 were respectively identified as fraxinellone (1), fraxinellonone (2), epoxy- fraxinellone (3) and limonexic acid (4) by comparison with the spectral data described in the literature.10-13 Epoxy-fraxinellone has a quaternary epoxy group attached to C8-C14, instead of the double bond as in fraxinellone. The spectroscopic data published13 could not furnish clear evidence of the spatial configuration of this moiety. In an attempt to confirm the epoxy group position, nOe difference experiments were performed, but the defining signals were superimposed (in d-chloroform and benzene-d6), frustrating clear conclusions. In order to solve these indistinguishable findings, an X-ray analysis (Figure 1) was performed to confirm the epoxy group position. Single crystal of epoxy-fraxinellone was produced by recrystallization followed by a crystal-growing process. The recrystallization involved dissolution of the material in proper amount of ethyl acetate-acetone followed by drops of water. Suitable crystals were selected and analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction which established undoubtedly the structure of the compound 3. Figure 1 shows an Ortep8 type view of 3 showing the thermal ellipsoids and atoms labels. This study shows that the molecular conformation of 3 is fixed by the presence of three main intramolecular interactions (Table 2). The analyses of the crystal packing showed the presence of others three intermolecular interactions in 3 (Table 3). These interactions give rise to the formation of infinite chains along the c axis (Figure 2). All geometrical details of the intermolecular contacts were interpreted as Table 1.

The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were elucidated on the basis of 1H NMR and EIMS spectra, and were in agreement with published data.10-12 The EI-mass spectra of both compounds shown to be formed mainly from the molecular ion by the consecutive exclusion of furan-3- aldehyde, CH3, HCHO and CO fragments. As previously reported, crude extracts of leaves and stems as well as fractions of R. echinata showed good inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth, the fungus cultured by the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa.16 Epoxy-fraxinellone showed not be toxic to the leaf- cutting ants, although limonexic acid displayed a significant reduction on lifetime (11 days) of leaf cutting ants, when compared with the control group (22 days) (Figure 3). Limonexic acid was also isolated from Dictamnus angustifolius17 a traditional plant used in China and from Tetradium trichotomum18 root barks, and together with isolimonexic acid are the main constituents of the fruit of Citrus nippokoreana.19 Despite being known since 1948,20 no significant reference of its bioactivity was found. Just a dozen degraded limonoids have been published, mainly from Rutaceae and Meliaceae plants. As the parent limonoids, some of them have been tested for biological activities including antifeeding and growth regulating activities against insects, and some relationship between the structures and biological activity has been studied.11 Table 2.

The mechanisms involved in the observed cell growth arrest of the four most potent compounds were carried out by studying their effect in cell cycle profile and programmed cell death. The results showed that one triterpene (odoratol) and two limonoids (gedunin and cedrelone) caused cell cycle arrest while only the limonoids gedunin and cedrelone were found to be very potent inducers of apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION Cancer represents one of the most severe health problems worldwide and the development of new anticancer drugs and more effective treatment strategies are fields of utmost importance in drug discovery and clinical therapy. Based on significant advances in cancer biology, much of the research in these areas is currently focused on cancer-specific mechanisms and the corresponding mo- lecular targets [1]. Natural products have been the major sources of chemical di- versity driving pharmaceutical discovery over the past century. Many natural products and synthetically modified natural product derivatives have been successfully developed for clinical use to treat human diseases in almost all therapeutic areas [2]. In fact, plant-derived compounds have played an important role in treat- ment of cancers, and some of the most promising and effective drugs have come up from plant sources like taxol®, camptothecin, combrestatin, vinblastine and vincristine. These drugs have also been the major source of new drug candidates for cancer chemo- therapy [3]. Apart from these, many other plant-derived compounds are now in clinical trials as anticancer agents. One of the most interesting groups of plant natural products is the triterpenoid group. Over the past decade, coming to the fore- ground of interest due to their diverse biological effects are a large group of cyclic triterpenoid-like substances which comprise more than 4000 different identified compounds so far. Triterpenoids are studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, hepatoprotective, anal- gesic, antimicrobial, antimicotic, virostatic, immunomodulatory and tonic effects. They are used in prevention and treatment of hepatitis, parasitic and protozoal infection and above all, for their cytotoxic effects [4]. *Address correspondence to this author at CEQUIMED-UP - Centro de Estudos de Química Medicinal, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Aníbal Cunha 164, 4050-047 Porto, Portugal; Tel: (351) 222078916; Fax: (351) 222003977; E-mail: madalena@ff.up.pt §These authors equally contributed to this work From a biological point of view, most important triterpenoid structures are oleanane, ursane, lupane and dammarane triterpe- noids. However, in what concerns the anticancer effects, not many triterpenoid compounds have been so far studied. Among these, the lupane triterpene betulinic acid and the ursane triterpenes boswellic acid and ursolic acid have been exhaustively studied for their anti- cancer effects. Betulinic acid, which belongs to the lupane group, has been investigated intensively for its anticancer activity. Betulinic acid was found to exhibit the cytotoxic effects against human melanoma cell lines MEL-1, 2 and 4 having the IC50 ranging from 0.5-1.6 g/ml and dose dependent fragmentation of DNA with induction of apoptosis occurred 24 hours after administration [5]. Cytotoxic effects of betulinic acid were also found in other cell lines including ovarian A2780, OVCAR-5, GROV-1, large cell lung cancer NCI- H460, epidermoid carcinoma A431, melanoma Me665/2/21, Me665/ 2/60, small cell lung cancer POGB and POGB/DX (doxorubicin resistant) with the IC50 values ranging from 1.5-4.5 g/ml. How- ever, it showed lower toxicity to non-tumor cell lines such as HDFC (normal dermal fibroblasts, IC50 = 10.2 ± 1.5 g/ml) and PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes, IC50 = 50 g/ml), in compari- son with doxorubicin (HDFC, IC50 = 0.38 g/ml; PBL, IC50 =0.02 g/ml). Interestingly, betulinic acid was markedly more effective than cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and radiation on the primary cancer cells isolated from glioblastoma multiforme [6]. It was demonstrated also that one of the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid and its derivatives was apoptosis induction which was mediated by increasing permeability of the mitochondrial membrane which disturbs the transmembrane potential, causing the release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), with the resulting activation of caspases 3 and 8. Subsequent cleavage of the substrates and nuclear fragmentation thus occurred [7]. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 or BcL-xL proteins suppresses activation of caspases and other markers of apoptosis of neuroectodermal origin [8]. Furthermore, betulinic acid was found to exert its cytotoxic effect against human glioma cell lines 770 Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 Cazal et al. (LN-229, U87, MG, T98G, LN-18 and LN-308) and an increased level of the proapoptotic protein Bax was observed 24 hours after treatment with betulinic acid. The induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for activation of caspase 3, also occurred [9]. On the other hand, clones of these cell lines express- ing high levels of Bcl-2, showed reduced ROS without activation of betulinic acid induced apoptosis. These findings were in accordance with the fact that the antiapoptotic properties of Bcl-2 are connected with antioxidative defence mechanisms. This underlines the importance of producing ROS in the induction of apoptosis by betulinic acid. Betulinic acid is also an inhibitor of the enzyme aminopeptidase N which takes part in the angioproliferative and metastatic activity of tumors. From a clinical perspective, it is interesting to point out that betulinic acid exhibits its greater effect in an environment with a pH lower than 6.8, which is the case for the majority of tumors [10]. Tellingly, in contrast to non- cancer cells, cancer cells subjected to hypothermia showed increased sensitivity to betulinic acid [11]. For the ursane group, boswellic acid and its derivatives were found to be cytotoxic to glioma cell lines [12]. In animal model, depending on dose, they caused an increased passage of cells to apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival after implantation of cell lines of malignant glioma C6 [13]. Deriva- tives of boswellic acid were found to induce differentiation in leu- kemic cell lines in low concentrations and in high concentrations they led to apoptosis [14]. The antiproliferative effects of these derivatives are connected to their ability to inhibit both topoi- somerase I and II, whose activity is critical for the proliferation of cancer cells. Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (AKBA), originally isolated from Boswellia serrata, was found to inhibit constitutive STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription-3) in human multiple myeloma cells [15]. Activation of STAT3 has been linked with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and angiogene- sis of tumor cells, including human multiple myeloma. Thus, agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential as cancer thera- peutics. Lipophilicity of boswellic acid derivatives allows them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and thus renders them the potential for use in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS. Concerning this, they were found to show higher inhibitory effects against glioma cells than those of the clinically used anticancer agents camptothecins [16] and etoposide [12]. Furthermore, derivatives of boswellic acid are shown to be suitable for palliative treatment of progressive or relapsing brain tumors, due to, among other things, their anti-edematous properties [17]. Another interesting member of the ursane group is ursolic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid in higher plants. This compound was found to show inhibitory activity against mammalian DNA polymerases and , and human DNA topoisomerases I and II. It also inhibits bovine DNA polymerase , rat polymerase , HIV reverse transcriptase. It was also found to lower transcription of COX-2 by inhibition of the signal pathways PKC and AP-1. As the expression of PKC and AP-1 is elevated in a number of tumors, thus targeting these molecules is one of the aims of antiproliferative therapy [18]. One of the most important members of the oleanane group is oleanolic acid which is present in high concentration in the ginseng root and it showed a range of antitumour effects. Oleanolic acid was shown to induce differentiation in the teratocarcinoma cell line F9 [19]. Furthermore, it was found to exhibit also antimutagenic and antiangiogenic activities [20, 21]. In addition, it also stimulates the release of NO and TNF-, including induction of iNOS activity and TNF- expression in macrophages. This effect is mediated by its ability to activate DNA binding to the transcription complex NF- B and thereby its activation. Maslinic acid, another oleanane triterpenoid which is present in high concentrations in the protective wax-like coating of olives, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of HT29 colon cancer cells [22]. Treatment with maslinic acid resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death in colon- cancer cells. Mechanism study has revealed that maslinic acid in- hibited considerably the expression of Bcl-2 whilst increasing that of Bax. It also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-c and activated caspases 9 and 3. Finally, for the dammarane group, fomitellic acids A and B, the secondary metabolites of basidiomy- cete Fomitella fraxinea, were shown to inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase and , and human DNA topoisomerase I and II. It exhibited also cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines NUGC-3, and PC-12 where differentiation was observed with subcytotoxic concentrations [23]. In the course of our research program on isolation, synthesis and evaluation of anticancer activity of plant natural products, we have evaluated the capacity of two dammarane type triterpenes (1 and 2), four tirucallane type triterpenes (3-6, Fig. 1) and eight Fig. (1). Structure of dammarane (1, 2) and tirucallane (3, 4, 5, 6) triterpenes evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.

Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the four most active compounds was also investigated for their effects on the cell cycle profile and the programmed cell death of the NCI-H460 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, at ambient temperature on a Bruker ARX 400 instrument operating at 400 and 80 MHz, respectively. The Shimadzu LC-6AD model HPLC equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-6AV UV detector (240 and 215 nm) and a Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2Ga column (400 x 25 mm, 5m particle size) was used. For column chromatography, Silica gel 60 (Acros organics) and Sephadex LH 20 (Amersham Pharma- cia Biotech AB) were used. Solvents were from Synt and reagents were from SIGMA, unless otherwise stated. Extraction and Isolation of the Compounds Isolation of Cabraleadiol (1) and Ocotillone (2) Fruits of Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. was collected in Federal University of Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The plant material was identified by T.D. Pennington of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (UK). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of De- partamento de Engenharia Florestral, Dendrologia of the Federal University of Viçosa. After removing seeds, dried fruits (460g) were ground and ex- tracted with ethanol (3 x 500 mL), at room temperature and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 88 g of a concentrated ethanolic extract which was dissolved in 400 ml of a 3:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O. The aqueous methanolic solution was partitioned successively with hexane (2x300 ml), CH2Cl2 (2x300 ml) and EtOAc (2x300 ml) to furnish hexane (47.4 g), dichloro- methane (5.4 g) and ethyl acetate (4.4 g) fractions. The hexane fraction was applied over a silica gel column (250 g) and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, eight 700 ml fractions were collected as follows: fr 1 (hexane), fr 2 (hexane- CH2Cl2, 1:1), fr 3 ((hexane-CH2Cl2, 3:7), Fr 4 (hexane), fr 5 (CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 1:1), fr 6 (EtOAc), fr 7 (EtOAc-MeOH, 1:1), fr 8 (MeOH). Fr. 2 (120 mg) was placed on a gel permeation column of Sephadex LH- 20 (50 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of MeOH-CH2Cl2 to afford three 250 ml subfractions. Subfr 2 (88.6 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (15 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of hex- ane-Me2CO to give five 100 ml fractions. Frs 3 and 4, after evapo- ration of the solvent by reduced pressure, afforded, respectively, 24.4 mg of cabraleadiol (1) and 16.3 mg of ocotillone (2) whose structures were established by 1H and 13C NMR as well as compari- son of their spectral and physical data with those reported in the literature [24, 25]. Isolation of 7-Deacetoxy-7-Oxogedunin (7) and 6-Acetoxygedunin (10) Fruits of Carpa guianensis Aubl. were purchased from the city of Belém (Pará State, Brazil). Dried and ground fruit aril (160g) was extracted with MeOH (3 x 500 ml) at room temp. The metha- nolic solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 40 g of the crude methanol extract which was dissolved in 150 ml of a 4:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O and then partitioned with hexane (3x 150 ml) and EtOAc (3x 150 ml) to give, respectively 23 g and 15 g of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. The ethyl acetate extract was Fig. (2). Structure of limonoids (7-14) evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.

Purification of fr 8 by isocratic HPLC, using a mixture of MeOH/ CH2Cl2 (7:3) as solvent and a UV detec- tion at 254 nm, yielded 32.1 mg of 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (7) and 55.8 mg of 6-acetoxygedunin (10) whose structures were estab- lished by comparison of their 1H and 13CNMR data with those re- ported in the literature [26]. Preparation of Acetonide of Odoradol (5) Odoratol (4, 25 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of acetone and one drop of conc.H2SO4 was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, under N2 atmosphere, for 3 h after which the solution was evaporated and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was washed with H2O to remove H2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent gave 15 mg of acetonide of odoratol (5). Isolations of the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3), odoratol (4), 22-hydroxytirucalla-7, 24-diene-2,3-dione (6) and the limon- oids gedunin (8) and 7-deacetoxygedunin (9) from Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona cilata var. australis have been described previ- ously by de Paula et al. [27, 28]. Isolation and characterization of the limonoids 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12), toonacilin (13) from Toona ciliata were described by Neto et al. [29, 30] while isolation of guyanin (14) from Hortia oreadica, was reported by Severino et al. [31]. Biological Activity Reagents RPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, phos- phate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were from Gibco Invitrogen Co. (Scotland, UK). Acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), penicillin, streptomycin, sulforhodamine B (SRB) and trypan blue were from Sigma Chemi- cal Co (Saint Louis, USA). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Tris were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Solutions of Compounds Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and kept at -20 ºC. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were freshly prepared just prior to each assay. Cell Lines Three human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 (breast adenocarci- noma, ECACC), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, a kind gift from NCI, Bethesda, USA) and A375-C5 (melanoma, ECACC) were grown as a monolayer and routinely maintained in RPMI- 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml strepto- mycin), at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Tumour Cell Growth Assay The effect of the compounds on the growth of the described human tumour cell lines was evaluated according to the procedure adopted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) in the “In vitro Anticancer Drug Discovery Screen”, which uses the protein- binding dye SRB to assess cell growth [32, 33]. The plating density of each cell line was 1.5 x 105 cells/ml for MCF-7, and 7.5 x 104 cells/ml for NCI-H460 and A375-C5. Cells were allowed to attach overnight in 96-well plates and were then exposed for 48 h to five serial concentrations of the compounds, starting from a maximum concentration of 150 μM (final concentration). At the end of this incubation period the adherent cells were fixed in situ with 10% TCA (final concentration), washed with distilled water and stained with 0.4% SRB (solubilised in 1% acetic acid). The bound stain was solubilised in 10 mM Tris and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (EAR400 STL-Labinstruments). For each test compound and for each cell line a dose-response curve was made and the value of GI50, corresponding to the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the net cell growth, was calcu- lated as described elsewhere [33]. Doxorubicin, used as a positive control, was tested in the same manner. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile and Levels of Apoptosis in the NCI-H460 Cell Line The compounds with GI50 bellow (or similar to) 10 M were selected for further analysis of their effect on cell cycle profile and apoptosis. These assays were carried out in the NCI-H460 cells, since they were one of the most sensitive cells to these compounds. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7.5104 cells/ml) and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h, in order to adhere. Cells were then incubated for 48 h with complete medium (control), the compounds solvent (DMSO) or with the compounds at their respective GI50 concentra- tions (determined by the SRB assay). Cells were then harvested and further processed for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cellular DNA content (for cell cycle analysis and presence of sub-G1 peak) was then analyzed as previ- ously described [34], using an Epics XL-MCL Coulter flow cy- tometer, plotting at least 20,000 events per sample. Apoptosis was analyzed using the Human Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis Kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Measurement of phosphatidylserine externalization was processed using a flow cytometer plotting at least 20,000 events per sample (as above). Both cell cycle distribution and apoptosis data were analyzed using the FlowJo 7.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). At least three inde- pendent experiments were carried out and results are presented as the average and standard error (SEM) of those experiments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Six triterpenes (Fig. 1) and eight limonoids (Fig. 2) were evalu- ated for their ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of three human tumour cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non- small lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5), using the protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) method and their growth inhibitory effect, expressed as GI50 (M), is shown in Table 1. Following a continuous exposure for 48 h, all six triterpenes (1- 6) and only four limonoids (8, 11, 12, 13) were found to be active against all three tumour cell lines whereas the other four limonoids (7, 9, 10 and 14) were inactive (Table 1). The tirucallane triterpene odoradol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15 - epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) showed strong cell growth inhibitory activity, presenting their GI50 values below 12 M for all three cell lines. Interestingly, the limonoid cedrelone (12) was found to be not only the most active growth inhibitor but also more selective on NCI-H460 (GI50 = 2.77 ± 0.07M) and A375-C5 (GI50 = 2.60 ± 0.21M) cell lines when compared to odoradol (4), gedunin (8) and 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11). While the dammarane cabraleadiol (1) showed moderate activity in all three cell lines (GI50>30 M), the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3) and 22-hydroxytirucalla-7,24-dien-2,3-dione (6) showed moder- ate growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but strong activity against A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, the dammarane triterpene ocotillone (2) showed only weak inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but moderate activity against A375-C5 cells whereas the limonoid toonacillin (13) showed weak inhibitory activity against all three cell lines. Though cabraleadiol (1) and ocotillone (2) are both 20, 24 – epoxydamma- rane, they differ only in the stereochemistry of C-24 and the func- tional group on C-3. With the C-24S configuration and the hydroxyl Evaluation of Triterpenes and Limonoids on Human Tumour Cell Lines Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 773 group on C-3, cabraleadiol (1) exhibited ca. three times higher in growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells than that of ocotillone (2) which has a ketone function on C-3 and the opposite configuration of C-24. However, the growth inhibitory effects on the A375-C5 cells are similar for both compounds. In fact, cabraleadiol (1), isolated from various plant sources, has been previously tested for its cytotoxicity against various tumour cell lines. Phongmaykin et al. [35] reported a weak cytotoxic effect of this compound, isolated from Chisocheton penduliflorus (Meli- aceae), on a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Qiu et al. [24] have found no cytotoxic effect of cabraleadiol (1), isolated from Aglaia lawii, on the LNcaP, Col 2 and KB cancer cell lines. On the other hand, ocotillone (2), isolated from Betula platyphylla var. japonica, was evaluated against a variety of human cancer cell lines, and was found to show no cytotoxicity against the KB (human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx), K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and COLO205 (colon carcinoma) cell lines. Interest- ingly, though ocotillone (2) did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against KB-C2 (cochicine-resistant KB) cells (IC50 values >100 M), it was found to show moderate cytotoxic activity (with IC50 ranging from 20.6 to 64.2 M) in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine. The en- hanced cytotoxicity of ocotillone (2) against KB-C2 cells in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine as compared with that in the absence of colchicine, suggesting that this triterpene might show some MDR-reversing effects [25]. For the tirucallane triterpenes, odoratol (4) was the most active analogue exhibiting GI50 values in the rank of 10 M. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 of odoratol (4) by a ketone group in odoratone (3) caused a two fold decrease of the growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cell lines; however this structural alteration did not affect the growth inhibi- tory activity against the A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, trans- forming the vic diol functionality on the furan ring of odoratol (4) into its acetonide (5) led to a loss of activity. Concerning the limonoids, the most active analogue was cedre- lone (12), exhibiting GI50 values below 5 M in all three cell lines. Although the capacity of cedrelone (12) to inhibit the in vitro growth of human tumour cells have not been previously reported, this compound is known to demonstrate several other activities including insecticide [36], antifeedant [37] and antifungal activity [38]. Although its growth inhibitory effect was ca. two folds less than that of cedrelone, the structurally related limonoid 6-acetoxy- 14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) also exhibited strong growth inhibi- tory activity against all three cancer cell lines. Interestingly, Maneerat et al. [39] have found that 6-acetoxyepoxyazadione, isolated from Chisocheton siamensis and which differs from 11 only in the presence of the carbonyl group on C-16 of the former, was inactive against oral human epidermal carcinoma (KB), small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Among the limonoids whose structure possessing the lactone moiety on the ring D, gedunin (8) was the only member which exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three human tumour cell lines (GI50 10 M); however 7-deacetylgedunin (9) was inactive. Inter- estingly, Brandt et al. [40] have evaluated, among several ana- logues, gedunin (8) and 7-deacetylgedunin (9), obtained from neem oils, for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cell lines. While gedunin (8) was found to exhibit strong antiproliferative activity against both cell lines (IC50 = 8.84±0.03 for MCF-7 and 3.22± 0.6 for SKBr3), 7-deacetylgedunin (9) showed only moderate activity (IC50 = 28.96±4.48 for MCF-7 and 21.09± 5.95 for SKBr3). Gedunin (8) was also shown to mani- fest anticancer activity via inhibition of the 90 kDa heat shock pro- tein (Hsp90) folding machinery [41] and to induce the degradation of Hsp90-dependent client proteins similar to other Hsp90 inhibi- tors [42]. In order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the most active compounds, they were assayed for their effect on the cell cycle profile of the NCI-H460 cells. Thus, NCI-H460 cells were treated with odoratol (4), gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) at their respective GI50 concentrations (values of GI50 for NCI-H460 from Table 1) for 48 h and processed for cell cycle analysis. Results (Fig. 3) show that the majority of the compounds tested (with the exception of 11) affected the normal cell cycle distribution of the NCI-H460 cells. Odoratol (4) was found to induce a cell cycle ar- Table 1.

Doxorubicin was used as positive control of the assay and the following GI50 values were obtained: MCF-7 = 42.8 ± 8.2 nM; NCI-H460 = 94.0 ± 8.7 nM; A375-C5 = 79.5 ± 8.4 nM. 774 Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 Cazal et al. rest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% cells in this phase upon DMSO treatment to 70% of cells following treatment with this compound), causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 13%) and G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 11%) phases of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with gedunin (8), the cell cycle progression was blocked (arrested) in the S phase (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 60%), leading to a de- crease in the % of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). Incubation with cedrelone (12) caused an accumulation of cells (arrest) in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 40%) and the G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 43%) phases of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the % of cells in G1 (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). In addition, there were indications that odoratol (4), gedunin (8) and cedrelone (12) induced apoptosis because of the increase in the sub-G1 popu- lation of cells when compared to control. Therefore, a specific apoptosis assay was carried out. Indeed, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was performed to deter- mine the % of cells in early and late apoptosis (and necrosis) by flow cytometry, following treatment of NCI-H460 cells with the selected compounds. Results showed that for all tested compounds, but very modestly for odoratol (4) and 6-acetoxy-14,15- epoxyazadirone (11), the % of cells in early (annexin V positive, PI negative) or late apoptosis (annexin V-positive, PI positive) were increased upon treatment of cells with the GI50 concentration of the compounds (Table 2). Gedunin (8) caused an increase in cell death from approximately 12.6% in controls (or 11.2% in DMSO control) to 47.2% in cells treated for 48 h with the GI50 concentration of this compound. Indeed, cedrelone (12) was particularly effective in inducing programmed cell death, causing 80.3% of cell death upon 48 h treatment of the cells with its GI50 concentration. It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the observed apoptotic inducing effects, particularly the effects on caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be investigated, by analyzing the levels of Bax and other apoptosis related proteins, such as Bcl-2 or BcL-xL. This would be possible by analyzing ex- tracts of cells treated with the compounds (with or without caspase inhibitors) for the levels of apoptosis associated proteins, by West- ern Blot with appropriate antibodies, as has been carried out by others for example in order to study the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by lupeol [43]. CONCLUSION Six triterpenes (two dammaranes and four tirucallanes) and eight limonoids, isolated from the members of the families Meli- aceae and Rutaceae, were evaluated by the SRB method for their cytotoxic effect against three human tumour cell lines. The tirucal- lane triterpene odoratol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12) were the most active inhibitors of cell growth (GI50 less than 12 μM). Of these, cedrelone (12) has shown to be the most active growth in- hibitor, presenting GI50 values below 4.20 μM in all three tested cell lines. From the analysis of the cell cycle profile in NCI-H460 cells, it was possible to conclude that odoratol (4) arrests cell cycle at the G1 phase, gedunin (8) causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase and cedrelone (12) at the S and G2M phases while 6-acetoxy-14,15- epoxyazadirone (11) did not affect the cell cycle profile of these cells. In addition, analysis of programmed cell death indicates that odoratol (4) and 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) cause a very small increase in cell death but gedunin (8) and particularly cedrelone (12), are very potent inducers of programmed cell death. In conclusion, cedrelone (12) is very potent by causing cell cycle Fig. (3).

It is evident from the number of recent studies that triterpenoid compounds represent a promising and expanding platform for natu- ral anticancer agents whose potential is currently still not fully ex- ploited by pharmaceutical industry. As a number of recently studied triterpenoids compare very favourably with drugs in current use [44], it is foreseeable that attention of many research institutions and pharmaceutical companies will be drawn to this class of com- pounds.

Received: 15 November 2010; in revised form: 2 December 2010 / Accepted: 6 December 2010 / Published: 13 December 2010 Abstract: Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae), popularly known as guarantã, goiabeira, is a native tree from Brazil. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the ethanol stems extract afforded the isolation of six alkaloids: leiokinine A, leptomerine, kokusaginine, skimmianine, maculine and flindersiamine. All isolated compounds were tested for acetyl cholinesterase inhibition, in vitro and displayed anticholinesterasic activity. The alkaloid leptomerine showed the highest activity (IC50 = 2.5 μM), similar to that of the reference compound galanthamine (IC50 = 1.7 μM). The results showed for the first time the presence of alkaloids leptomerine and skimmianine in E. leiocarpa (Engl.) with potent anticholinesterasic activity. Keywords: Esenbeckia leiocarpa; Rutaceae; alkaloids; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors OPEN ACCESS Molecules 2010, 15 9206 1. Introduction The genus Esenbeckia comprises 30 species distributed in Tropical America [1]. Chemical studies of Esenbeckia spp. showed that they synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites, particularly quinolinic, quinolonic and indolic alkaloids and furocoumarins, and these compounds were considered chemical markers of this genus [2-4]. Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae), native from Brazil, is an ornamental tree widely distributed in Brazilian Dense Ombrophilous Atlantic Forest from South of Bahia to São Paulo states and is commonly known as guarantã (SP), goiabeira (BA), antã-forte and guarataia (ES) [5]. Previous studies on E. leiocarpa have been reported in the literature, and various compounds have been isolated from it, such as the alkaloids kokusaginine, flindersiamine, maculine, dictamnine, 4- methoxy-2-(3´-pentyl)quinoline, 1,4-dihydro-1-methyl-2-(3´-pentyl)quinolin-4-one, leiokinine A and leiokinine B, twelve indole derivatives, three lignans, one coumarin, two amides and the methyl 4- isoprenyloxy-trans-cinnamate [3,6,7]. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive cognitive dysfunction that results from a deficiency in cholinergic activity in brain [8]. Several plant-derived drugs (rivastigmine and galanthamine) that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can be used to treat early stages of AD, since these compounds increase the endogenous levels of acetylcholine to boost cholinergic neurotransmission. In a recent review, 260 chemically defined natural molecules were evaluated for acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The compounds tested were classified in alkaloids (139), monoterpenes (27), coumarins (18), triterpenes (17), flavonoids (14), benzenoids (13), diterpenes (8), oxygen heterocycles (5), sesquiterpenes (5), stilbenes (3), lignans (2), sulfur compounds (2), proteids (2), polycyclic (1), quinoid (1), benzoxazinone (1), carotenoid (1) and alycyclic (1) [9-11]. Strong efforts to discover new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from a vast number of plant species were realized in our laboratory. In a screening of 58 extracts from native Brazilian plants, the ethanolic crude extract of the stems of Esenbeckia leiocarpa showed a strong acetylcholinesterase inhibition and was chosen for bioassay-guided fractionation in order to isolate the biologically active compounds and evaluate the acetylcholinesterase inhibition of these compounds. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Effect of crude extract and hexane and alkaloid fractions on acetylcholinesterase inhibition The crude ethanol extract of Esenbeckia leiocarpa stems inhibited 91.1 ± 0.2% of acetylcholinesterase activity when tested at 200 μg/mL. Acid-base partition was used to separate the crude extract (35.8 g) of Esenbeckia leiocarpa into two fractions, hexane and chloroform (Alkaloid) and the yield of each fraction was 0.64% and 3.30%, respectively. The ethanol extract, hexane and alkaloid fractions of Esenbeckia leiocarpa inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity with an IC50 50.7 μg/mL, 6.0 μg/mL and 1.6 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 1). The chloroform fraction, with positive result for alkaloids (Dragendorff´s and iodoplatinate reagents), exhibited highest level of AChE inhibition and was selected for further purification.

Chromatographic profile of alkaloid fraction The analytical chromatographic (HPLC) analyses of alkaloid fraction (105.0 mg) from E. leiocarpa afforded 14 fractions from which six major compounds were identified. They were fractionated by chromatographic procedure and the anticholinesterasic activity of each fraction was tested by TLC bioassay as described by Marston et al. [12]. The fractions 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 presented strong anticholinesterasic activity on TLC bioassay (results not showed) and retention times (tR) of 9.12 min, 11.69 min, 14.26 min, 15.60 min and 20.73 min, respectively (Figure 2).

Isolation and identification of alkaloids from stems of E. leiocarpa The alkaloid fraction of E. leiocarpa (m = 105.0 mg) was dissolved into MeOH (10 mg/mL) and submitted to RP-HPLC using acetonitrile-water-methanol (10:45:45) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 242 nm and flow rate of 8 mL/min, affording 14 fractions (Fractions 1–14). From preparative HPLC, fractions Fr. 7 (tR = 15.4 min) and Fr. 9 (tR = 19.3 min) were identified as two 4- quinolinone alkaloids, leiokinine A (1, 5.8 mg) [3] and leptomerine (2, 16.0 mg) [13], respectively. Fractions Fr. 10 (tR = 24.5 min) and Fr. 11 (tR = 26.2 min) yielded two furoquinoline alkaloids, kokusaginine (3, 5.7 mg) [14] and skimmianine (4, 12.3 mg) [15], respectively. In addition, fraction Fr. 12 (tR = 34.3 min) afforded a mixture of two others furoquinoline alkaloids (3.2 mg), maculine (5) [16] and flindersiamine (6) [6] (Figure 3). Their identification was based on analysis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as by comparison with literature data, 13C-NMR data of compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 and 1H-NMR data of compounds 5 and 6 (see Experimental section). Figure 3. Chemical structures of alkaloids with anticholinesterasic activities, ALK 1 to 6.

Anticholinesterasic activity of alkaloids The alkaloids maculine, flindersiamine, kokusaginine, leptomerine, leiokinine A and skimmianine identified in this work were previously isolated from other Esenbeckia species [1,17-19]. The alkaloids leptomerine and skimmianine have already been isolated from Haplophyllum heptomerum (Rutaceae) in 1986 [13]. However, this is the first occurrence of leptomerine and skimmianine in Esenbeckia leiocarpa (Engl.). To date, no study on evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity was performed with species of the genus Esenbeckia. In the present paper, the alkaloids isolated from stems of E. leiocarpa, leiokinine A and skimmianine presented acetylcholinesterase inhibition with IC50 values of 0.21 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. While leptomerine and kokusaginine showed IC50 values of 2.5 μM and 46 μM, respectively (Figure 4).

On the other hand, the alkaloids isolated from leaves of E. belizencis Lundell were tested in the brine shrimp toxicity assay and revealed that kokusaginine have mildly toxicity (LC50 = 367 ppm) and flindersiamine did not showed toxicity (LC50 > 1,000 ppm) [20]. The alkaloids maculine, kokusaginine, skimmianine and flindersiamine demonstrated weak mutagenic activity [21,22]. In another species of Rutaceae, Raulinoa echinata Cowan, these same alkaloids showed antifungal activity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, a symbiotic fungus of leaf-cutting ants [23]. 3. Experimental 3.1. Plant material The stems of Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. were collected in January 2007 from a specimen cultivated at the “Cidade Universitária - Armando Salles de Oliveira- CUASO”, USP, São Paulo State, Brazil, and identified by Dr. José Rubens Pirani. A voucher specimen (SPF 1169) was deposited at the Herbarium of the Departamento de Botânica, Instituto de Biociências, USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. 3.2. Extraction and isolation The dry stems of Esenbeckia leiocarpa (1000 g) were powdered and extracted with ethanol (5 × 1.5 L) using a maceration method. The ethanol extract (35.8 g) was re-dissolved in aqueous solution (HCl 0.1 M, 2 × 120 mL) and the insoluble portion was filtered off. The acid solution was partitioned with hexane (7 × 60 mL) yielding a hexane fraction (0.230 g). The acid aqueous fraction was basified with NH4OH (pH 10) and partitioned with CHCl3 (7 × 60 mL) yielding an active alkaloid Molecules 2010, 15 9210 fraction (1.182 g). All the fractions were tested in biological test for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity. 3.3. General methods for compounds identification The alkaloid fraction was analyzed in HPLC Varian Pro Star 310 system equipped with a 20 μL injection loop. The column used was a Phenomenex C-18 (250 × 4.6 mm) maintained at 20 °C. Twenty μL of the sample (1 mg/mL) was injected, the mobile phase (1 mL/min) was ACN: MeOH: H2O (10:45:45). Preparative HPLC was carried out using Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm × 20.0 mm) preparative column. HPLC analysis of alkaloid fraction afforded 14 fractions. Fractions 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were identified by NMR analyses. The 1D – (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using the CDCl3 as an internal standard.

Molecules 2010, 15 9211 3.4. Anticholinesterasic assay Acetylcholinesterase activity was measured using a 96-well microplate reader [24] based on Ellman´s method [25]. In the 96-well plates, 25 μL of 15 mM acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) in water, 125 μL of 3 mM DTNB in buffer C, 50 μL of buffer B, 25 μL of plant extract, alkaloid or hexane fractions (0.2 to 100.0 μg mL-1) were added and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s for three times. Then 25 μL of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme were added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min for two times. The percentage of inhibition was calculated by comparison with the rates for the sample to a blank (10% MeOH in Buffer A). The following buffers were used. Buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; buffer B: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction (BSA); buffer C: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2·6H2O. 3.5. Statistical analysis of data Data were presented as means ± SEM of experiments realized at least in triplicate. The IC50 values were calculated by means of regression analysis. 4. Conclusions The alkaloids kokusaginine, flindersiamine, maculine and leiokinine A were previously isolated from E. leiocarpa. On the other hand, this is the first occurrence of leptomerine and skimmianine in Esenbeckia leiocarpa. There are many compounds identified from higher plants with acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity as huperzine A, galanthamine isolated from Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) Trev. [26] and Galanthus nivalis Lumikello, respectively, and used for dementia treatment. Some biological activities have been reported for the alkaloids isolated in this work, but none have been found to be related to acetycholinesterase inhibition. This work demonstrated that these alkaloids presented potent anticholinesterasic activity and must be tested in pharmacological models in vivo to determine if they have activity on memory of mice and pre clinical studies before human application.

Received: 24 May 2014; in revised form: 1 July 2014 / Accepted: 16 July 2014 / Published: 12 August 2014 Abstract: Previous investigations of H. oreadica reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of H. oreadica, H. brasiliana and H. superba searching for other secondary metabolites present in substantial amounts for taxonomic analysis. In a continuation of the investigation of the H. oreadica, three new limonoids have now been isolated 9α-hydroxyhortiolide A, 11β-hydroxyhortiolide C and 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7- deoxoinchangin. All the isolated compounds from the Hortia species reinforce its position in the Rutaceae. With regard to limonoids the genus produces highly specialized compounds, whose structural variations do not occur in any other member of the Rutaceae, thus, it is evident from limonoid data that Hortia takes an isolated position within the family. In addition, H. superba afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen, which may not be a genuine natural product. Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle- spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, X-Ray fluorescence and Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy experiments show that the Sephadex LH-20 was modified after treatment with NaOCl, suggesting that when xanthotoxin (8-methoxy-psoralen) was extracted from cleaning of the gel column, chlorination of the aromatic system occurred.

Introduction Previous investigations of H. oreadica reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids [1–3]. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of H. oreadica, H. brasiliana and H. superba. Three new limonoids have now been isolated (1–3), 1 and 3 from taproots and 2 from stem of H. oreadica. In addition, H. superba afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (4) from branches (Figure 1). Figure 1.

Hypohalite (HOX) is the halogenating species produced by haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. This may be considered as a source of electron-deficient halogen (X+) that can react with an electron-rich centre in the substrate, as the coumarins. In contrast, the most common types of halogenated coumarins are those with a prenyl epoxide ring, which was cleaved under acid conditions (H+/Cl−). There is some suspicion that these compounds are artefacts of the isolation procedures. These compounds are a comparatively rare group isolated from Rutaceae plants such as in Toddalia asiatica [5,7-dimethoxy-6- (3-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)coumarin], Murraya paniculata [7-methoxy-8-(1-hydroxy-2-chloro- 3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin, 7-methoxy-8-(1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin], and in Triphasia trifolia [7-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)-8-(3-methyl-2-oxobutyl)coumarin, 5-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)psoralen] [4–6]. Aromatic systems react with chlorine in an electrophilic substitution reaction, in which chlorine acts as the electrophile (Cl+), whose presence is rare in the isolation procedures. 3-Chloro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-chromen-2-one appears to be unique as natural metabolite in the coumarin class, which was isolated from leaves of Ficus krishnae, Moraceae [7]. Most of the phytochemical studies on Rutaceae genera have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed coumarin containing chlorine in the 1-benzopyran-2-one skeleton if they had been present. In developing countries, as in Brazil, where universities and research funding agencies cannot afford Sephadex (LH-20) in sufficient quantities for scientific studies, using cleaning gel with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a common practice. However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of Sephadex LH-20 and hypochlorite in the formation of compound 4, until the cleaning gel is analyzed by solid NMR, X-Ray fluorescence (XRF), Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), Infrared (IR), and Fourier transform Raman (FTR) to confirm whether this can serve as an efficient chloroniun ion supplier. Molecules 2014, 19 12033 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structure Elucidation of New Compounds The spectra of compounds 1–4 can be seen in Figures S1–S30 in the online Supplementary. Compound 1 showed spectral characteristics close to those of hortiolide A (5) (C27H32O7; Figure 1), which has previously been isolated from H. colombiana (H. colombiana = H. brasiliana) [8]. HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H32O8 for compound 1, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with 5. The main change observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 1 was the presence of a signal of a hydrogen of a hydroxyl group at δ 2.94 (s). This hydrogen at δ 2.94 showed HMBC correlation with the 13C-NMR signals of C-8 (δ 90.2). The methyl proton signal at δ 1.52, assigned to Me-19, showed cross peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-1 (δ 178.8), C-5 (δ 42.3), C-10 (δ 50.6), and at δ 80.5 (quaternary), allowing the assignment of the last signal to C-9, since it was the only carbon left in the skeleton for a 3J. These correlations indicated the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-9. The relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was determined from gNOESY experiments. The nOes of the H3-19 (δ 1.52), H3-18 (δ 1.21) and H3-30 (δ 1.71), coming from 9-OH (δ 2.94), required the 9-OH to be syn (α) to Me-18, Me-19 and Me-30. The structure of the new natural product 1 was thus established as 9α-hydroxyhortiolide A. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of hortiolide A (5) [9]. Table 1. 1H-NMR spectroscopic data for 1–4.

Compound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) to hortiolide C (6) isolated previously from dichloromethane extract of taproots of H. oreadica [2]. In HMBC experiments the unsubstituted Molecules 2014, 19 12035 C-12 emerged from the correlation between the H3-18 signal at δ 1.15 and the 13C signal at δ 42.7, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 1.68 (m), ascribed to H2-12. The signal for H-12 was coupled to the 1H signal at δ 4.43 (d, J = 4.8 Hz) assigned to H-11, indicating a hydroxyl group at C-11. HREIMS showed the molecular formula C27H32O9 and confirmed the structure 2 for this compound. In the g-NOESY experiments, the nOes of the H3-19 (δ 1.54) and H3-30 (δ 1.80), coming from H-11 (δ 4.43), required the 11-OH to be anti (β) to Me-18 and Me-30. Thus, the structure of compound 2 was proposed as 11β-hydroxyhortiolide C. The NMR spectra and extensive analysis of 2D-NMR spectra (Table 2) suggested the ichangin-type (7) [12] framework for compound 3. Some of the changes observed in the NMR spectra were signals for the presence of a secondary acetoxyl group (13C signals δ 169.6, 21.4, 1H signal -OCOMe δ 2.15). A significant downfield shift for C-1 (δ 80.0), when compared with ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7), determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. The 13C signal at δ 80.0 showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 4.04 (brd, J = 4.2 Hz), which showed cross-peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-3 (δ 169.4), C-19 (δ 65.6), and C-9 (δ 43.3). The 1H signal at δ 4.04 and a methyl signal at δ 2.15 showed long-range correlation with the 13C-NMR signals at δ 169.6, confirming an acetoxyl group at C-1. A second change observed in the 13C-NMR spectra was the replacement of the resonance for a carbonyl by signal for an oxymethine carbon at δ 73.2, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 4.56 (t, J = 2.6 Hz). A hydroxyl group must thus be connected to C-7 due to the observed correlations of the 1H signal at δ 4.56 with the 13C-NMR for C-5 at δ 53.6, C-8 at δ 43.0 and C-30 at δ 18.4. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7). The NOE of the H-1 (δ 4.04) coming from H-5 (δ 2.25) and H-9 (δ 2.72) were weak but definite, suggesting a spatial proximity of H-1α to H-5α and H-9α, and confirming the acetoxyl group in the β-configuration as in ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7, S* configuration at C-1) [12]. In addition, the NOE of the H-7 (δ 4.56) coming from H3-30 (δ 0.95) required the hydroxyl group at C-7 to be anti (α) to H3-30 (β). The structure of the new natural product 3 was thus established as 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxoinchangin. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of ichangin (7) [12]. The coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (4) was not separated from xanthotoxin (8) and isopimpinellin (9). The 1H-NMR in addition to signals described in the literature for 8 and 9, revealed signals nearly the same as that of 9 (Table 1). In addition four methoxyl group signals were observed at δ 4.27, 4.16 (6H), and 4.29, which were placed at C-8 in 8, C-5 and C-8 in 9 and at C-8 in 4, respectively, by NOE experiments. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of coumarins if C-5 is unsubstituted the doublets arising from H-3 and H-4 are found at ca δ 6.2 and 7.6, respectively. The downfield shift of the H-4 to about δ 8.0 occurs in C-5 alkoxyl-substituted coumarins, as in 9 in comparison with 8 [13]. Hence, the doublets at δ 7.76, 8.11 and 8.15 were assigned to H-4 for 8, 9, and 4, respectively, and indicating that C-5 was substituted in 4. This mixture was analyzed by GC-MS (Figures S26–S29 in supplementary), which established that the coumarins were xanthotoxin (8), isopimpinellin (9), and indicated the compound 4 to contain chlorine, determining the position of this halogen at C-5, whose spectroscopic properties accord with the above data. This mixture was also analyzed by ESI-MS (Figure 30 in supplementary), which showed protonated molecule ([M + H+]) at m/z 251.5 and ([M+2 + H+]) 253.5 for compound 4. Simulation of isotope ratio mass spectrum for C12H7O4Cl provided the differences in Molecules 2014, 19 12036 naturally-occurring isotopic abundances, which showed peaks similar to those found for compound 4, the [M+2 + H+] (m/z 253) peak about one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak ([M + H+] m/z 251), confirming the presence of chlorine. Although, the structure of 4 has been described as being a synthetic product and the 1H-NMR data for both are in close agreement with the structure proposed 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen [10]. 2.2. Sephadex LH-20 Analysis The mixture of coumarins 4, 8 and 9 was purified by gel permeation column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20, which was repacked with cleaning gel with sodium hypochlorite (0.8% watery solution). Sephadex LH-20 is cross-linked dextran which has been hydroxypropylated to yield a chromatographic media with both hydrophilic and lipophilic character [14,15]. Solid-state cross-polarization/magic-angle-spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS 13C-NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural product formed by the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite. Pure Sephadex LH-20 and the gel, which was washed only with sterile distilled water and allowed to swell overnight, were used as control. The HETCOR experiment (Figure 2) permitted the assignments of the protonated carbons signals at δ 97–94, 72–70, 68–63, and 15–20 to all C-1, C-2-4, C-5-6 and the methyl of propyl group, respectively, comparable with those reported for dextran samples [16,17]. It is clear that water induces no change in chemical shifts as shown in Figure 3. However, it is noted that the treatment with water leads to the increase of the linewidth. Another important observation which should be noted regards the intensity of the signals related to the carbons from glycoside units. For non-treated Sephadex, the hydroxyl groups from glycoside units in different polymeric chains interact through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the structure becomes very rigid, favoring the dipolar coupling. In this case the cross polarization is more efficient and the signals become more intense, even when compared to side aliphatic branches [18]. The 13C-NMR spectrum for cleaning gel (Figure 3) showed that the signals for all C-1 (δ 97–94) were of markedly different intensity (lowest intensity), suggesting the oxidation of α-D-glucopyranoses by hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which would result in depolymerisation [19]. In Sephadex LH-20 C-2-4 are hydroxypropylated, thus δ-aldonolactone could have glycosidic linkages by hydroxypropyl groups. This spectrum also showed that sodium hypochlorite affected the shape of the 13C-NMR signals for all C-2-4 (δ 81-70), suggesting that the oxidation reaction of free -OH at carbons C-2 and C-3 may have occurred. The C-5, C-6 and methyl signals of control and cleaning gel appeared at similar chemical shifts. The CP/MAS 13C-NMR experiments showed that the course of the reaction with hypochlorite is somewhat more complex than the oxidation indicated for C-1, C-2 and C-3. Hypochlorite specifically oxidizes the α anomer, and the initial product formed is a δ-aldonolactone (Scheme 1). Although, the free -OH in the glycoside units and in the hydroxypropyl groups must have been involved in the reaction with hypochlorous acid formed in the equilibrium of sodium hypochlorite and H2O, resulting in dextran ether hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which can serve as an efficient chloronium ion supplier [20,21].

For pure Sephadex this ratio is 4.0, for Sephadex-H2O it is approximately 3.3 and for Sephadex-H2O-NaOCl it is 2.0. This variation seems to be quite intriguing, but it is possible that this is related to the exchange of hydrogen by chlorine atoms, which occurred in the polar hydroxyl groups from the glycoside units. Furthermore, the presence of chlorine atoms and water molecules induce the increasing distance between chains. Once these events takes place the cross-polarization 1H→13C becomes less efficient, and the signal becomes less intense as mentioned earlier [18]. In order to observe the possible formation of dextran ether hypochlorite in the structure of Sephadex, 35Cl solid state NMR experiments were run, however no signal was observed (as can be seen in Figure 31 in supplementary). There are few papers in the literature that investigate 35Cl-NMR in organic compounds, and they always involve small molecules [22–24]. Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy analyses of pure Sephadex LH-20, gel washed with water, and gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite showed homogeneous beads in the first two (Figures 4 and S32–S34 in supplementary). In contrast, beads originating from gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite were not homogeneous and some strange material aggregates were observed between and on the polymer beads (Figure 4). These differences suggest modification in the structure of the polymer, or the presence of reaction products with hypochlorite or of salt sodium hypochlorite and HOCl. Comparing the standard gel with those treated with NaOCl shows that there is a decrease in the diameter of some particles, suggesting a dilution or formation of other products (Figure 4D,E). X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry was used and the results showed the presence of chlorine in pure Sephadex LH-20, in gel washed with sterile distilled water and cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (Figure 5). The chlorine content was 1.8 fold greater in the gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (0.159%) than that in pure Sephadex LH-20 (0.089%), and 2.9 than that in gel washed with water (0.055%).

These data suggest that if there were oxidation reactions and the formation of hypochlorite, their yields were low. In their FTR spectra there is a band at 847 cm−1 corresponding to the vibration of the α-anomer, characteristic of Sephadex [25]. Given that the yield of the reaction with hypochlorite was low, a second hypothesis is that the hypochlorite salt and HOCl retained on Sephadex beads react directly with the active aromatic system for aromatic substitution reactions with HOCl. Concluding two synthetic pathways to chlorination is possible, in the presence of dextran ether hypochlorite or HOCl retained on Sephadex beads, and when the mixture of xanthotoxin (8) and isopimpinellin (9) were extracted from cleaning Sephadex LH-20 column, the chlorination of aromatic system occurred in 8 giving 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen. These results showed that the use of cleaning Sephadex LH-20, deserves more attention than it has received so far. 2.3. Identification of Known Compounds The major types of rutaceous secondary metabolites were also isolated and they show that H. oreadica, H.brasiliana and H. superba are related to other species of Hortia. However, the alkaloids N-methylatanine, robustine [26,27], 7,8-dehydrorutaecarpine [28], edulitine [29], integriquinolone [30], the coumarins psoralen, bergapten, xanthotoxin, 5-methoxyseselin, braylin, isopimpinellin, prangol, heraclenol, seselin, 5-methoxyseselin [31], the flavonoids isosakuranetin [32], acacetin [29], neoponcirin [33], and the limonoid limonin [34] are reported for the first time from the Hortia. Groppo and collaborators [35,36] studying plants of the genus Hortia showed that H. brasiliana, H. arborea, H. colombiana and H. chocoensis represent the same arborescent species, and that H. brasiliana V. and ex. DC. H. badinii M.A. Lisboa was used to designate individuals of Hortia, but this error was corrected by Groppo and collaborators [35], who recognized it as H. brasiliana. The name H. brasiliana was wrongly applied to a shrubby species of central Brazil by Saint-Hilaire, today recognized as H. oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani [35]. H. superba Ducke, H. regia Sandwith and H. longifolia Spruce (ex. Engl) are accepted species in the genus Hortia according to Groppo and Pirani [36]. The known compounds isolated in this work and occurrences in other Hotia species can be seen in supplementary Table S1. 3. Experimental Section 3.1. Instrumentation Optical rotations were measured by using a Perkin Elmer 241 spectropolarimeter, or DIP 370 Jasco. High resolution EI-MS: VG Autospec-Fisons by using electron ionization technique at 70 eV (linked scan at 8 keV collisions with Helium); HRESI-MS analyses were performed on an UltroTOF-Q (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) fitted with an electrospray ion source operating in the positive ion mode; the accuracy masses were obtained by using of TFA-Na+ (sodiated trifluoroacetic acid) as internal standard; samples were directly infused into the ionization source at a flow rate of 10 µL/min the source block and desolvation temperature was 150 °C. IR: Bomen-Ft/IR. FEG-SEM Molecules 2014, 19 12041 micrographs: Supra 35-VP, Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany. NMR: Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard. All the solid state NMR experiments were performed in a Bruker Avance III 400 machine, operating at a 9.4 T magnetic field, which corresponds to 399.94 MHz for 1H, 100.57 MHz for 13C and 39.206 MHz for 35Cl resonance frequencies. This machine is equipped with a MAS 4mm broadband solid state probehead. The sample (powdered) was packed in a 4mm zirconia rotor, and a KEL-F cap. The carbon-13 1D spectra were obtained by using a ramped cross polarization under magic angle spinning with total side band suppression (pulse sequence named CPTOSS). These experiments were conducted at 298 K and using a spinning speed of 5000 Hz. The CPTOSS parameters were: contact time of 2 ms, recycle delay of 5 s, acquisition time of 34 ms, spectral width of 295 ppm and 512 scans were averaged. High power decoupling was done by using a TPPM15 decoupler program under a 1H field of 70 KHz. 2D 1H-13C FSLG-HETCOR experiment were run at 10,000 Hz of spinning speed. The pulse sequence parameters were: recycle delay of 2 s, contact time of 200 μs for observing spin diffusion signals, number of scans of 32, LG field of 80 Khz, acquisition time of 16 ms and SPINAL64 for decoupler program at 70KHz of 1H irradiation, and 256 transients were obtained in F1. FSLG-HETCOR was performed at only 298 K, in a total time of 4.5 h. The pulse sequence used for acquiring 35Cl solid state NMR was one pulse with acquisition time of 44 ms, a spectral window of 1200 ppm and the spinning speed was 10,000 Hz. For all the experiments the sample was spun by using gaseous nitrogen. FT Raman: I-Raman 485-H, Laser 785 nm BWTEK (USA). XRF: MiniPal 4, PW 4024, P Analytical B.V. (Almelo, The Netherlands). 3.2. Cleaning Sephadex LH-20 and Repacked Column When a column has been in use for some time, it may be necessary to remove contaminants. Thus the gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by gentle agitation and was allowed to react overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was washed three times with sterile distilled water to remove residual NaOCl. After cleaning, the column was carefully re-equilibrated with 2–3 column volumes of methanol before it is used again. Part of cleaning Sephadex was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis. The control gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed only with sterile distilled water by gentle agitation and was allowed to swell overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis. 3.3. Plant Material Hortia brasiliana V. and Ex. D.C. was collected (May 2000) in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. H. oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani was collected (September 2005) in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. H. superba Ducke was collected (December 2001) in road from Manaus to Itacoatiara km 31, Amazonas state, Brazil. All the plants were identified by José Rubens Pirani of the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo, and vouchers are deposited in the herbarium of the same department (Pirani 4672 and Groppo Jr. 458, Groppo Jr. 950, respectively). Molecules 2014, 19 12042 3.4. Extraction and Isolation Ground taproots (3.3 kg), stems (2.4 kg) and leaves (3.2 kg) of Hortia oreadica, stem (938 g), stem bark (270 g) and leaves (655 g) of H. brasiliana, stem (938 g), and stem bark (270 g) of H. superba were successively extracted using hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH, at room temperature. Small branches of H. superba were also analyzed, and ground branches (483 g) were extracted 3 times at room temperature using ethanol. All extracts were monitored by 1H-NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS. Only those displaying features of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives and limonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. These extracts were repeatedly purified by silica gel column chromatography (CC, 230–400 mesh), gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH-20), preparative TLC, by the centrifugal preparative TLC performed on a chromatotron of Harrison research 50B, Spectra/Chrom CF1-fraction collector, silica gel 375 mesh, diameter 26 cm, and then by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification (polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G).

Conclusions This study shows that H. oreadica taproots appear to be a rich source of complex limonoids. By contrast, other organs of Hortia species have long been the subject of chemical investigation, which have found many typically rutaceous compounds but the limonoids are simple and less abundant than in the H. oreadica taproots. Therefore, all Hortia roots or taproots should be re-examined for limonoids. Clearly further chemical investigations on the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite will be essential to better understand the structures of the products formed. Additional experiments by enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain the main oxidized components soluble for NMR and MS analysis are in progress. However, information on the risks to recover Sephadex LH-20 with NaOCl must be clarified immediately, to avoid publication of possible chlorinated compounds as a natural occurrence.

INTRODUÇÃO Vochysia thyrsoidea Pohl., conhecida como gomeira, pau-de-go ma, casca-doce, árvore do vinho, vinheiro-do-campo, goma-arábica, goma-arábica-da-lagoa-santa, é uma Vochysiaceae encontrada em abundância no cerrado brasileiro e campos cerrados de altitude, usada na medicina popular como expectorante.1 O estudo prévio relacionado à caracterização química dos cons tituintes desta espécie revela o isolamento de dois ácidos elágicos (ácidos 3,3’,4-tri-O-metilelágico e 3,3’,4,4’-tetra-O-metilelágico) e das duas quinonas (1,8-dihidroxi-6-metoxi-3-metilantra-quinona e 2,6-dimetoxi-1,4-benzoquinona).2 Poucos estudos desta planta são descritos e não houve anteriormente avaliações de atividades biológicas para esta espécie. Este trabalho relata as atividades citotóxica e inibitória da ativi dade das catepsinas B e K de extratos (folhas e cascas) e compostos isolados das cascas do caule de V. thyrsoidea, bem como o isolamento e elucidação estrutural de duas catequinas (1-2) e de dois derivados butil-D-frutofuranosídeo (3-4) (Figura 1), além do ácido 2,4,6-trime toxibenzóico e ácido 3-oxo-urs-12en-28-oico. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentação e procedimentos gerais Os espectros de RMN 1H e 13C 1D/2D foram obtidos em espec trômetro Bruker modelos ARX 100 MHz e DRX 400 MHz, utili zando CD3OD e acetona-d6 como solventes e TMS como referência interna. O espectro de massas de alta resolução foi realizado em um equipamento da Bruker Daltonics, modelo micrOTOF - Q II – ESI – TOF. As separações cromatográficas em coluna à pressão atmos férica foram realizadas em sílica gel 60 (230 a 700 Mesh) da Merck e Sephadex LH-20 da Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB. As placas usadas para cromatografia em camada delgada analítica (CCDA) foram de cromatofolhas de alumínio de sílica gel 60 F254 da Merck. As revelações das cromatoplacas foram feitas através de luz UV (254 e 365 nm) e por borrifamento com solução de vanilina sulfúrica. Os Figura 1.

(Vochysiaceae) 289 Vol. 37, No. 2 solventes (etanol, metanol, hexano, acetato de etila, diclorometano e n-butanol) utilizados na preparação dos extratos e fracionamentos cromatográficos foram todos de grau analítico. Material vegetal O material botânico de V. thyrsoidea foi coletado na Serra dos Pirineus, Pirenópolis - GO, em março de 2010 e identificado pela Dra. Mirley Luciene dos Santos. A exsicata (no7051) encontra-se depositada no Herbário da Universidade Estadual de Goiás, Campus Henrique Santillo, Anápolis – GO. Isolamento dos constituintes químicos As cascas do caule (Cc; 1.465 g) e folhas (F; 1.140 g) de V.thyrsoidea, após secagem em estufa a 40 oC e moagem, foram extraídas com etanol. Após eliminação dos solventes sob pressão reduzida, os extratos brutos foram obtidos [Cc (23,0 g) e F (150,0g)]. O extrato oriundo das cascas do caule foi particionado com MeOH‑H2O (1:3) e solventes de diferentes polaridades [hexano (1,5g), CH2Cl2 (1,3g), AcOEt (7,3 g), n-BuOH (1,0 g) e hidroalcoólico (10,8 g)] enquanto que o das folhas foi fracionado com celulose microcristalina D, fornecendo os extratos em hexano (5,6 g), CH2Cl2 (15,8 g), AcOEt (52,3 g) e MeOH (50,7 g). A fração diclorometânica das cascas do caule (1,3 g) foi croma tografada em duas etapas utilizando cromatografia de adsorção em gel de sílica, ambas em eluição isocrática com Hex:AcOEt (8,5:1,5). Desta última etapa cromatográfica foram obtidas 11 frações, dentre as quais a segunda fração foi identificada por comparação dos dados espectroscópicos de RMN 1H e 13C com a literatura como o triterpeno ácido 3-oxo-urs-12en-28-oico (2,0 mg).3 A fração 7 (190,0 mg) foi refracionada por cromatografia de co luna de gel de sílica no modo isocrático Hex:AcOEt (7:3), trazendo o isolamento do ácido 2,4,6-trimetoxibenzóico (5,2 mg), cuja estrutura foi proposta com base em dados espectrais de de RMN 1H e 13C e comparação com a literatura.4 O fracionamento do extrato de AcOEt das cascas do caule (7,3 g) foi feito através de cromatografia em coluna (CC) de gel de sílica,usando como fase móvel os solventes AcOEt:MeOH com gradiente de eluição em ordem crescente de polaridade. Desta coluna obteve-se 85 frações, que foram submetidas à análise por CCDA e então reunidas em 4 frações. A segunda fração (1,0 g) foi submetida à CC de gel de sílica, usando como fase móvel CH2Cl2:MeOH (4:1) no modo isocrático de eluição, o qual proporcionou o isolamento da substância 1 (3,0 mg). Após sucessivos fracionamentos desta fração 2 por cromatografia de exclusão (Sephadex LH-20) e eluição em MeOH 100%, obteve-se a substância 2 (3,0 mg) identificada por RMN 1D/2D.5 Catequin-3-O-(3”-trans-cinamoil)-α-raminopiranosideo (1).

A fração n-butanólica das cascas do caule foi fracionada por CC de gel de sílica com CH2Cl2:MeOH (9:1) no modo isocrático de eluição, fornecendo 48 frações que foram reagrupadas em 5 novas frações após análise por CCDA. A segunda fração (300,0 mg) foi cromatografada por CC de gel de sílica no modo isocrático usando Hex:AcOEt (7:3), gerando 16 subfrações. Dentre estas, as subfrações 8 e 11 foram identificadas como substância 3 (20 mg) e 4 (10 mg), respectivamente. 1-Butil-D-frutofuranosideo (3).

Ensaio toxicológico Baseado na metodologia de Meyer et al. (1982), com algumas adaptações, foi preparado um ambiente adequado para o desenvol vimento da Artermia salina.6 Os extratos brutos e particionados da casca do caule e das folhas de V. thyrsoidea foram solubilizados em água salina e DMSO 1%, e partindo-se de soluções padrão efetuaram-se diluições. Foram separadas 10 larvas por tubo de ensaio contendo 10 mL das soluções nas concentrações de 125, 250 e 500 μg/mL em triplicata. Cada teste foi acompanhado de um controle negativo, solução salina, do veículo usado para diluir os extratos (DMSO 1%) e do controle positivo com K2Cr2O7 (DL50 = 20 a 40 ppm). As larvas A. salina em testes foram mantidas à temperatura ambiente (26 oC) sob iluminação artificial por um período de 24 horas. Após este período, foram realizadas leituras da contagem do número de larvas sobreviventes e mortas. A obtenção da dose que causa letalidade de 50% dos náuplios (DL50) foi feita por cálculos do método PROBIT de análise, por meio do software STATPLUS® 2005 (95% de confiança). Ensaio de atividade citotóxica in vitro As análises da citotoxicidade foram realizadas no Laboratório de Oncologia Experimental da Universidade Federal do Ceará por meio do método de MTT, que consiste em uma análise colorimétrica baseada na conversão do sal 3-(4,5-dimetil-2-tiazol)-2,5-difenil -brometo de tetrazolium (MTT) em azul de formazan, a partir de enzimas mitocondriais presentes em células metabolicamente ativas. As linhagens utilizadas, MDA-MB-435 (melanoma), HCT-8 (cólon humano), SF-295 (sistema nervoso central) e HL-60 (leuce mia), foram cedidas pelo Instituto Nacional do Câncer (USA), tendo sido cultivadas em frascos plásticos para cultura, utilizando o meio RPMI 1640 suplementado com 10% de soro fetal bovino e 1% de antibióticos (penicilina/estreptomicina). As células foram incubadas em estufa a 37 °C com atmosfera de 5% de CO2 e 95% de umidade, seguido da observação do crescimento celular com ajuda do microscópio de inversão a cada 24 horas. Quando necessário, as células foram repicadas em meio de cultura novo, em uma concentração de 1,0 x 105 céls/100μL. de Sousa et al. 290 Quim. Nova As substâncias foram diluídas em DMSO puro e estéril na con centração de 5μg/mL (dose única) e adicionadas em placas de 96 poços (100μL/poço), onde a análise de cada amostra foi feita a partir de dois experimentos realizados em duplicata, tendo como controle positivo o quimioterápico doxorrubicina. Após um período de incubação de 72 horas, a absorbância foi lida em um espectrofotômetro de placas (DTX 880 Multimode Detector) a um comprimento de onda de 550 nm.7 Os resultados foram analisa dos segundo suas médias e respectivos desvios-padrão no programa GraphPad Prism. Ensaio de inibição enzimática: catepsinas B e K Os ensaios de inibição enzimática frente à catepsina B e K foram realizados no Laboratório de Produtos Naturais da Universidade Federal de São Carlos, usando-se as mesmas condições experimentais para ambas as catepsinas. A metodologia aplicada, com algumas modificações, consiste na determinação da inibição enzimática através da detecção do aumento da fluorescência que ocorre com à hidrólise do substrato fluorogênico Z-FRMCA, o qual é detectado em espectrofluorímetro com fenda de excitação ajustada para λex= 380 nm e emissão λem= 460 nm.8 O modelo do espectrofluorímetro utilizado neste ensaio foi da Molecular Devices Corporation – Spetra MAX M3 GEMINI XS. Os ensaios foram feitos em triplicatas, nos quais as amostras foram diluídas em DMSO, obtendo uma concentração final do composto de 125 μM. Um volume de 5 μL foi transferido para cada poço das placas de ELISA (96 poços) e adicionou-se o MIX 1 e a enzima em concen tração 3mM em tampão (acetato de sódio 100 mM com 5 mM de EDTA e pH de 5,5) pré-ativada com DTE (5,0 mM) aos analitos. A enzima ficou em contato com os compostos por 5 minutos e poste riormente foram adicionados 10 μM do MIX 2 (substrato fluorogênico Z-FRMCA em tampão), realizando-se a leitura em seguida. Para os compostos que apresentaram inibição significativa (supe rior ou igual a 80%) frente às enzimas testadas foram determinados os valores de IC50. O potencial de inibição foi determinado utilizando-se dez diferentes concentrações do inibidor e construindo uma curva de concentração x resposta pelo método de regressão não-linear do programa Origin. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A substância1 foi identificada pela análise dos espectros de RMN 1H, HSQC e HMBC (Tabela 1) e massas de alta resolução (HRESIMS) em comparação com a literatura.5,9 O espectro de massas de alta resolução foi obtido no modo nega tivo, e exibiu um pico característico do íon em 549,1755 [M – H]–, sugerindo a fórmula molecular C30H30O10. No espectro de RMN de 1H a substância 1 apresentou sinais na região de hidrogênios alifáticos [δ4,69 (d; J= 7,6 Hz), 3,98 (m), δ 2,97 (dd; J= 15,2 e 5,2 Hz) e 2,71 (dd; J= 15,6 e 8,4 Hz)], característicos dos hidrogênios H-2, H-3 e dos hidrogênios diastereotópicos H-4a e H-4b respectivamente. Na região de deslocamentos químicos de hidrogênios aromáticos os sinais em δ5,95 (d) e 5,86 (d) com cons tante de acoplamento de J= 2,4 Hz referem-se ao acoplamento entre os hidrogênios H-6 e H-8. Os dois dubletos em δ 7,27 (d) e 6,80 (d) com J= 8,4 Hz foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2’, H-6’, H-3’ e H-5’ referente a um sistema de acoplamento de spins AA’XX’. Tabela 1.

(Vochysiaceae) 291 Vol. 37, No. 2 A presença do resíduo de açúcar nesta estrutura foi observada pela presença dos sinais entre δ 3,62 e 4,19 de hidrogênios carbi nólicos. A caracterização da α-ramnose foi então realizada com base no sinal do dubleto em δ 1,30 (d, J= 6,4 Hz) referente ao acoplamento dos hidrogênios da metila (H-6”) com H-5”, bem como pelo dubleto em δ 4,19 (J= 1,8 Hz) referente ao acoplamento diequatorial de H-1” e H-2”.5 A unidade trans-cinamoíla presente pôde ser observada pelo conjunto de sinais no espectro de RMN 1H, onde na região de aro máticos um conjunto de dois dubletos em δ 7,76 e 6,58 (H- 7”’ e H-8”’), ambos com J=16 Hz integrando para um hidrogênio cada, caracterizou o acoplamento em trans. Os multipletos em [δ 7,61 (m; H-2”’ e H-6”’) e 7,40 (m; H-3”’, H-4”’ e H-5”’)] apresentaram um padrão de acoplamento típico de anel aromático monossubstituído. No experimento de HMBC observou-se que o dubleto em δH 4,19 referente ao hidrogênio anomérico da ramnose (H-1”) apresentou correlação com o sinal em δC 76,0 (C-3), confirmando que a unidade de ramnose encontra-se ligada à posição 3 do flavonoide. Também foi possível por este experimento observar as correlações do sinal em δH 7,76 (H-7”’) com os sinais em δC 119,4 (C-8”’), δ 136,0 (C-1”’) e δ 168,2 (C-9”’). A ligação da unidade cinamoíla ao oxigênio do carbono C-3” (δC 73,5) da ramnose foi confirmada através dos sinais δH5,02/ δC 168,2 que correspondem à correlação do H-3” e o carbono da carbonila (C-9”’) (Figura 2). Uma substância estruturalmente relacionada a este flavonoide (1), o canferol 3-O-α-L-(4”-E-p-cumaroil)-raminosideo foi relatada anteriormente em Qualea grandiflora Mart. (Vochysiaceae).5 Os frutofuranosídeos tiveram suas estruturas determinadas por meio da comparação da literatura com os dados experimentais de RMN 1H, HSQC, HMBC, DEPT 135 e reação de acetilação utilizando DMAP como catalisador.10 O espectro de RMN de 1H da substância 3 apresentou um triple to bastante intenso em δ 0,92 (t; 3H) referente aos hidrogênios da metila; um sexteto em δ 1,38 integrando para dois hidrogênios e um quinteto em δ 1,51referente aos hidrogênios metilênicos H-b e H-c. O duplo-dubleto em δ 3,47 (dd; J= 6,7 e 9,1 Hz) indicou a presença de uma unidade O-glicosídica que provocou a desblindagem destes hidrogênios metilênicos da cadeia alquílica (H-d). A substância 4 também apresentou na região entre 0,9-3,5 ppm o mesmo padrão de multiplicidade de sinais encontrados na substância 3, que juntamente com o número de hidrogênios estimados pela integral confirmaram também a presença de um grupo butila. Nestes espectros observa -se ainda a presença de sinais na região entre δ 3,40-4,2 referente à presença de uma unidade de açúcar. No experimento de DEPT 135o foram observados quatro sinais positivos (CH e CH3) e cinco sinais negativos (CH2), os quais foram atribuídos aos respectivos carbonos pela comparação com os deslo camentos químicos assinalados anteriormente (HSQC). Os sinais em δC 62,3 e 62,0 pertencem aos carbonos C-6 e C-1 do açúcar confirmando a frutofuranose pela presença de dois grupos metilênicos. O sinal negativo em δC 65,0 refere-se ao C-d (OCH2) e os outros dois sinais em δC 33,5 e 20,5 correspondem aos grupos CH2 da cadeia alquílica. O sinal em δC 14,4 é referente à metila da cadeia alquílica (C-a) e os outros três sinais (δC 83,3, 78,5 e 77,3) são respectivamente dos carbonos do açúcar C-5, C-3 e C-4. A posição do grupo alquila ligado à unidade de açúcar foi determi nada por meio do experimento de HMBC, que apresentou a correlação entre os sinais δC 65,0/δH3,70 e 3,62 atribuídos, respectivamente, aos H-1 e H-1’ e o C-d da cadeia alquílica. A substância 4 foi diferenciada da substância 3 com base nos sinais de carbono projetados no espectro de HMBC. A correlação do H-d(δH 3,51) e o C-c (δC 33,3), bem como a correlação deste hidrogênio (H-d) e o C-2 (δC 103,0) confirmaram a ligação da cadeia alquílica à unidade de açúcar no C-2.10 Ensaios biológicos A análise dos resultados do teste TAS, segundo Meyer,6 foi realizada por meio de uma relação entre a dose letal média, DL50, e o grau de toxicidade, nos quais consideram-se tóxico valores de DL50<1000 μg/mL. Todos os extratos testados, exceto o hexânico das folhas (DL50<1000 μg/mL), apresentaram toxicidade frente a A. salina [cascas do caule: 283,94 (EtOH), 499,60 (hexano), 288,33 (CH2Cl2) e 476,58 (AcOEt) μg/mL; folhas: 209,08 (EtOH), 921,47 (CH2Cl2), 32,06 (AcOEt) e 151,90 (MeOH) μg/mL]. Os ensaios de toxicidade frente a esta espécie de microcrustá ceo apresentam correlação com diversas atividades biológicas,11 e baseando-se nas substâncias obtidas no estudo fitoquímico foram realizados ensaios de inibição enzimática e de citotoxicidade. Das frações do extrato bruto das cascas do caule e folhas de V. thyrsoidea avaliadas, nenhuma demonstrou potencial citotóxico rele vante (percentual de inibição do crescimento tumoral maior que 80%) para as linhagens celulares tumorais testadas, MDA-MB-435 (mela noma), HCT-8 (cólon-humano), SF-295 (sistema nervoso central). Dentre os compostos avaliados, o 2-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo apresentou valores significativos de toxicidade com IC50=36,80 µM frente às células tumorais do sistema nervoso central (SF-295) e IC50=25,37 µM em linhagem HL-60 (leucemia humana). Os compostos testados não apresentaram inibição frente à catespina K, entretanto frente à catepsina B obteve-se um resulta do de inibição enzimática moderado, apresentado pelo composto catequina-3-O-(3”-trans-cinamoil)-α-ramnopiranosídeo (1), com IC50=62,02 (+/-0,79 µM). CONCLUSÃO O trabalho contribuiu com a caracterização fitoquímica da planta V. thyrsoideaatravés do isolamento do catequin-3-O-(3”-trans- cinamoil)-α-ramnopiranosídeo, catequin-3-O-α-ramnopiranosídeo, 1-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo, 2-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo, ácido 2,4,6-trimetoxibenzóico e ácido 3-oxo-urs-12en-28-oico. Dentre as substâncias isoladas, os flavonoides e os frutofura nosídeos são relatados pela primeira vez no gênero Vochysia, e a substânciacatequin-3-O-(3”-trans-cinamoil)-α-ramnopiranosídeo, a qual apresentou moderada atividade inibitória frente a catepsina B, foi descrita pela primeira vez na literatura. Em relação à atividade citotóxica, o 2-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo foi a substância que apresentou o resultado mais significativo de inibição das células tumorais do sistema nervoso central e leucemia humana.
