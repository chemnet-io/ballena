A study of the endophytic fungi associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing 186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of _Nigrospora sphaerica_ and _Phoma betae_ liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential compounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-b-ol diterpene is being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including GC/MS, homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Asteraceae _Smallanthus sonchifolus_ (Poepp. and Endl.) H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. Some unique substances like the anti-microbial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones [1-3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF2-9), but deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South America, New Zealand and Japan [4-7]. The plant is also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal colonization.\n\nInteractions involving plants and fungi are quite complex. They may have qualitatively different relationships with a single host plant, from parasitism to mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are considered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages none of the partners, including the absence of external manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated fungi may produce substances with specific functions inside and outside the host plant in which they normally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anti-cancer [9].\n\nAs part of the bioprostecting program in endophytic fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10-13], it was considered that _S. sonchifolus_, commonly named Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce\n\n## Page 2\n\nbioactive secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and biotechnological purposes. Using this approach, 32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds. Some of the compounds isolated in this research are being reported for the first time as secondary metabolites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant associations is discussed.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Isolation, identification and preservation of fungal strains\n\nYacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in February 2006, in the city of Ribeirao Preto (S 21deg11.933' NO 47deg46.699'), State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirao Preto _campus_, University of Sao Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.\n\nThe collected plant material was washed with running tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were carried out by sequentially submerging the plant material in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were excised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA medium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 mg/ml) and incubated initially at 30 degC for 48 h, followed by 72 h at 23 degC. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures. Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure cultures were obtained.\n\nConidia producing strains were identified at the Department of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil. Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 degC in tubes containing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers onto PDA slants at 4 degC.\n\n### Cultivation and extraction procedures\n\nTwo culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for cultivation and screening of biological activities of the isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures.\n\nLiquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1). First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incubated at 30 degC for 7 d. After this period, aqueous suspensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 degC for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step, this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Buchner filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This procedure was carried out for a small scale extract production for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cultures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH, followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro\n\nFigure 1: Schematic outline of endophytic fungi cultivation and extraction procedures (experimental details in text “Cultivation and extraction procedures”).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nduce the mycelial ethanolic extract (EtM). An Erlenmeyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek medium and treated in the same way for control purposes.\n\nFor the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled water per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 degC for 40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation, one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about \\(2 \\times 2\\) cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incubation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 degC, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and the residual fraction (RS).\n\n### Isolation of compounds\n\nEaS fraction (20.2 g) of _Nigrospora sphaerica_ was fractionated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column (22.0 x 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents (step A, Fig. 2). Fraction M2EaS (9.9 g) was fractionated over silica gel column (CC, 230-80 mesh, 26.0 x 4.5 cm) using a gradient from with hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to MeOH (100%; step B) to provide 22 fractions. Fraction 13 (30.1 mg) was identified as compound **1**. Fraction M1EaS (3.1 g) was crystallized from a heated solution of MeOH/H2O 9:1 yielding compound **3** (101.0 mg; Fig. 2). Fraction EEaS (1.64 g) chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 25.5 x 5.0 cm) and eluted with the same gradient as above mentioned (step C) produced 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (246.6 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 28.0 x 3.0 cm) and using a gradient from hexane: EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%; step D) to yield 9 fractions. Fraction 6 (46.3 mg) was rechromatographed again on silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 20.0 x 1.3 cm) using the same gradient elution (step E) to yield compound **2** (16.9 mg).\n\n_N. sphaerica_ fraction EaL (474.3 mg) was fractionated over silica gel (CC, 400-200 mesh, 24.0 x 3.5 cm) by elution with gradient hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH (100%; step F) yielding 7 fractions. Fraction 7 crystallized spontaneously to afford compound **3** (98.0 mg).\n\nFraction EaS (16.5 g) originated from 20 day cultures of _Phoma betae_ (19 flasks) was chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 11.0 x 12.0 cm) under gradient elution from hexane:EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step G; Fig. 3) to afford 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (686.7 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230-80 mesh, 25.0 x 4.0 cm) by using gradient elution from hexane:EtOAc (8:2) to MeOH (100%; step H) to\n\nFigure 3: Schematic outline of isolation of compounds from _Phoma betae_.

Compound 2 (14.7 mg) was precipitated from fraction 5 (99.7 mg) using CHCl3 (step I).\n\nFraction EaS (888.2 mg) originated from 32 day cultures of _P. betae_ (1 flask, fungus sporulation time) was chromatographed over silica gel (400-200 mesh, 27.0 x 3.0 cm) using gradient elution with hexane: EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step J, Fig. 3) to provide 13 fractions (Pb-1 to 13). Fraction 4 (Pb-4, 21.9 mg) was submitted to HPLC using an isocratic solvent system containing hexane: EtOAc (9:1) delivered to the a semi-prep Nucleosil 100-7 column (250 x 10 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1, and monitored at 254 nm detection wavelength at 25 degC (step K). Compound 4 (12.1 mg) was collected at 41 min. The residual fraction (5.0 mg) collected at 45 min was resubmitted to HPLC employing a prep C18 Shimadzu column (250 x 20 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min-1, using MeOH as eluent, and monitored at 254 nm (step L). Compound 5 (0.6 mg) was collected at 28 min. Fraction 13 (Pb-13, 426.8 mg) was chromatographed over sephadex LH-20 column (60.0 x 2.5 cm) using EtOH as eluent (step M) to afford 7 fractions. Fraction 4 crystallized spontaneously to yield compound 6 (18.8 mg; step N).\n\n### Spectroscopic data of compound 1\n\nPimara-7,15-dien-3b-ol (1): white powder; molecular formula: C20H32O; [a]50-3.7deg (_c_ 2.15, CHCl3); EI/MS _m/z_ (rel. int.): 288 (30), 273 (60), 255 (100), 187 (38), 145 (35), 119 (55), 107 (70), 91 (55), 80 (48), 55 (42); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): d 5.69 (1H, dd, J = 10.8 and 18.0 Hz, H-15), 5.10 (1H, m, H-7), 4.82 (1H, dd, J = 1.5 and 18.0 Hz, H-16a), 4.79 (1H, dd, J = 1.5 and 10.4 Hz, H-16b), 3.13 (1H, dd, J = 4.4 and 11.6 Hz, H-3), 0.90 (3H, s, Me-18), 0.89 (3H, s, Me-19), 0.73 (3H, s, Me-20); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): d 39.2 (C-1), 29.1 (C-2), 79.0 (C-3), 37.1 (C-4), 52.8 (C-5 and 9), 35.8 (C-6), 113.2 (C-7), 38.9 (C-10 and 12), 20.9 (C-11), 35.2 (C-13), 44.1 (C-14), 145.4 (C-15), 110.8 (C-16), 28.1 (C-17), 35.6 (C-18), 21.6 (C\n\n## Page 5\n\n_folius_ tissues possibly demonstrating tissue specificity. Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization and five other species occurred simultaneously in two tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42, SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots. Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture conditions employed. They remain unidentified and were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated were identified by traditional taxonomical methods based on morphological features as established in Table 1.\n\nThe isolated genera _Drechslera_, _Fusarium_, _Phoma_, _Alternaria_, _Curvularia_, _Nigrospora_, _Glomerella_ and _Aspergillus_ have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a range of hosts [18-20]. They also have proven to be endophytes in several plant species [21-26] strengthening the argument that disease is an exception in the plant-microbe interaction, which could be more properly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis [27]. Genus _Papulaspora_ is a well-known competitive soil mold in the culture of mushrooms [28, 29] and it has just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few species as _Vitex negundo_[24], _Manilkara bidentata_[30], _Taxus chinensis_[31], _Amomum siamense_[32] and _Solanum tuberosum_[25]. _Preussia_, however, is recognized either as a soil or a coprophilous genus [33, 34] but has never been mentioned before as an endophyte.\n\n### Cytotoxic activity of extracts\n\nFrom the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL and RS were practically inactive (data not shown). The exceptions were RLSS33, RLSS75 and RLSS84, which\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Fungal strain** & **Taxonomic identification** & **Tissue occurrence** & \\\\ \\cline{2-4}  & **Leaves** & **Stems** & **Roots** \\\\ \\hline SS13 & _Papulaspora immersa_ Hotson & P & A & P \\\\ SS16 & _Preussia minima_ (Auersw.) von Arx. & P & A & A \\\\ SS20 & NI & P & A & A \\\\ SS21 & NI & P & P & P \\\\ SS22 & Mycelia sterile & P & A & A \\\\ SS26 & NI & P & A & A \\\\ SS29 & _Aspergillus aculeatus_ Lizuka & P & A & A \\\\ SS32 & _Glomerella cingulata_ (Stoneman) Spaulding et Schrenk & P & A & A \\\\ SS33 & _Drechslera ravenelli_ (Curt.)

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetate fractions from both culture types of _P. immersa_ (SS13), _N. sphaerica_ (SS67) and _A. tenuissima_ (SS77) produced good results on all tested cells indicating that production of bioactive molecules by these fungi does not depend on the culture medium employed. These observations emphasize the significance of these species in future biotechnology studies.\n\n### Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance of isolated compounds\n\n_N. sphaerica_ (SS67) and _P. betae_ (SS84) were chosen for large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive compounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts.\n\nThree substances were isolated from the _N. sphaerica_ EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound **1** was identified as pimara-7,15-dien-3b-ol, compound **2** as ergosterol peroxide and compound **3** as aphidicolin. Spectral data of compound **2** were in agreement with literature data [35], while compound **1**, recently detected in a plant essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36]. This is the first report of compound **1** obtained from a fungal source and having its structure completely elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds **1** and **2** showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested (Table 3).\n\nCompound **3**, isolated from the EaL fraction of _N. sphaerica_ (SS67) had its structure established as the diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR data that are in agreement with reported data [37]. Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \\hline\n**Fungus** & **Cell growth inhibition (\\%)** & & & & & \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & HCT-8 & MDA-MB435 & & & & \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** & **EaL fraction** & **EaS fraction** \\\\ \\hline SS13 & 100.0 (HA) & 54.5 (MA) & 95.2 (HA) & 81.3 (HA) & 98.1 (HA) & 34.2 \\\\ SS16 & 32.0 & 1.6 & 31.3 & 25.7 & 35.7 & 4.1 \\\\ SS20 & NC & 10.3 & NC & 11.0 & NC & 4.1 \\\\ SS21 & 27.2 & I & 37.0 & 1 & 23.3 & 10.9 \\\\ SS22 & 100.0 (HA) & I & 100.0 (HA) & 11.8 & 100.0 (HA) & 1 \\\\ SS26 & 31.9 & 19.9 & 17.1 & 15.9 & 41.2 & 24.9 \\\\ SS29 & 40.1 & 68.0 (MA) & 60.6 (MA) & 27.9 & 33.1 & 62.9 (MA) \\\\ SS32 & 56.6 (MA) & 33.7 & 20.0 & 33.0 & 47.7 & 15.1 \\\\ SS33 & 86.7 (HA) & 3.6 & 71.2 (MA) & I & 84.5 (HA) & I \\\\ SS36 & 52.4 (MA) & 35.3 & 38.7 & 44.7 & 49.0 & 19.7 \\\\ SS40 & 3.6 & I & 10.7 & 1 & 12.0 & I \\\\ SS42 & 30.9 & 41.0 & 36.3 & 52.0 (MA) & 21.2 & 27.1 \\\\ SS43 & 33.9 & 54.2 (MA) & 49.2 & 59.4 (MA) & 25.0 & 54.5 (MA) \\\\ SS44 & 62.7 (MA) & 23.3 & 50.7 (MA) & 12.1 & 48.1 & 3.2 \\\\ SS46 & 85.6 (HA) & 13.0 & 83.2 (HA) & 30.3 & 85.8 (HA) & 9.7 \\\\ SS50 & 30.2 & I & 57.9 (MA) & I & 12.3 & I \\\\ SS55 & 55.3 (MA) & I & 1 & I & 14.2 & I \\\\ SS62 & 99.8 (HA) & 27.2 & 51.4 (MA) & 32.2 & 67.5 (MA) & 31.8 \\\\ SS65 & NC & 1.4 & NC & 10.8 & NC & 14.2 \\\\ SS67 & 79.2 (HA) & 86.2 (HA) & 48.2 & 41.9 & 73.0 (MA) & 82.2 (HA) \\\\ SS68 & 39.2 & 55.2 (MA) & 36.4 & 23.3 & 26.9 & 54.4 (MA) \\\\ SS70 & 22.1 & 32.8 & 32.1 & 41.7 & 18.5 & 18.9 \\\\ SS73 & 28.4 & I & 6.6 & I & 9.1 & I \\\\ SS74 & 24.6 & 83.9 (HA) & I & 81.0 (HA) & 8.4 & 71.3 (MA) \\\\ SS75 & 19.5 & 22.2 & 41.0 & 4.9 & 7.4 & 28.1 \\\\ SS76 & 100.0 (HA) & 48.9 & 42.6 & 30.4 & 52.7 (MA) & 40.3 \\\\ SS77 & 94.7 (HA) & 72.9 (MA) & 82.0 (HA) & 53.0 (MA) & 78.3 (HA) & 69.2 (MA) \\\\ SS78 & 4.9 & I & 19.3 & 3.3 & 6.4 & I \\\\ SS79 & 26.2 & 5.1 & 1 & 12.4 & 8.4 & I \\\\ SS82 & 87.6 (HA) & 9.1 & 45.7 & 1.4 & 68.2 (MA) & I \\\\ SS83 & 49.3 & 8.8 & 27.7 & 32.5 & 51.0 (MA) & 16.5 \\\\ SS84 & 100.0 (HA) & 12.4 & 92.4 (HA) & 10.1 & 95.6 (HA) & 15.0 \\\\ control & 25.9 & 2.2 & 34.6 & 20.1 & 25.1 & 4.7 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Cytotoxic activity of the ethyl acetate fractions from liquid (EaL) and solid (EaS) cultures of the endophytic fungi isolated from _Smalanthus sonchitolius_.\n\n\n\n## Page 7\n\nagainst all cell lines (Table 3), but its direct _in vivo_ administration is difficult due to its poor water solubility and fast metabolization.

Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resultant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1H NMR techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only compound **2** was isolated corroborating the initial low activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day cultures yielded compound **6**, which was identified as dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines tested. The subfraction 1H NMR spectrum revealed a mixture of two substances in a 1:1 ratio, later separated and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (compound **4**) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl-isocumarin (compound **5**) in accordance with literature data (Fig. 4) [43, 44]. When compounds **4** and **5** were tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities, respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound **4** against other tumor cell lines had been previously described [45, 46] but the results in this report suggest that isocoumarin (compound **5**) and ergosterol (compound **4**) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating or improving either the therapeutic effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs [47, 48] or radiotherapy [49]. Our results suggest that compounds **4** and **5** might be considered as hits for drug development of a novel anti-cancer combination therapy.\n\nThe amounts of pesticides employed in _S. sonchifolius_ cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes _P. betae_ and _N. sphaerica_ and their host have similar biosynthetic pathways [52, 53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). _N. sphaerica_ is also known to cause both reduction of spore germination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic fungi, i.e, _Fusarium oxysporum_[55, 56], one of the isolated endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore, maintenance of _N. sphaerica_ and _P. betae_ as endophytes seems to be an ecological benefit to _S. sonchifolius_.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis study was funded by grants from the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) within the Biota-Bioprospecta-FAPESP - The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br), grant n\\({}^{\\circ}\\) 04/07935-6, and the Brazilian Government's National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).

The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artificial diet at 1 mg g\\({}^{-1}\\) and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superficial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g\\({}^{-1}\\). Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic _S. densiflora_ extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from _V. polygamma_ were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, flavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition.\n\n(c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry 2006 62 1072 1081 2006 1\n\nTaruma; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; _Vitex polygamma; Siphoneugena densiflora; Spodoptera frugiperda_; botanical insecticide; pest control\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nWith a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efficacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3\n\n_Spodoptera frugiperda_ JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Nocutuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important field crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by consuming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4\n\nOf the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, _Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5-9 This plant is commonly called 'Maria-Preta', 'Taruma', 'Congonha-cinco-folhas' and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, _Siphoneugena densiflora_ Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in Sao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named 'Uvatinga',13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nEven though the selected plant species have not been ordinarily employed in pest control, their families comprise several species with injurious properties to insects reported in the literature.15-21 The present paper specifically deals with the effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from _V, polygamma_ and _S. densiflora_ against fall armyworm (_S. frugiperda_). Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities.\n\n## 2 Materials and Methods\n\n### General\n\nHeteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, \\(J\\) 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethaneol) from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck-Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei Munchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low-resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple-quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectrophotometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pellets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Australia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 x 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software.\n\nColumn chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70-230 or 230-400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), Sephadex(r) LH-20 (25-100 mm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7(r) (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled.\n\n### Plants\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ were collected in July 2000, in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil, respectively.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after filtration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 degC. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 x 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting filtrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 degC) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid-liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol).

The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a final concentration of 1 mg g-1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 x 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 degC), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One first-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 +- 1 degC, 70 +- 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single first-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot's formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 x 6.0 cm) containing filter paper at the bottom (4.0 x 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10-20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence.\n\nThe control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground.\n\nMethanoic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls.\n\n#### 2.5.2 Isolated compounds\n\nFour well plates (24 x 1.5 mL wells) were filled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar flow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 mL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artificial congealed diet. The final concentration was about 0.1 mg g-1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar _S. frugiperda_ larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot's formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound.\n\n### _Statistical analysis_\n\nData consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment means were established by Tukey's test.24 Results are given in the text as probability values, with \\(P\\) < 0.05 adopted as the criterion of significance. Complete statistical analysis was performed by means of the SAS program.25\n\n## 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n### _Structure elucidation_\n\nSubstances **1** to **43** were identified by comparison of their NMR, MS, UV and IR spectroscopic data with data previously reported in the literature.

They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid-liquid partition.\n\nPartition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD-AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2).\n\nThe VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of _Vitex madiensis_ caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in _S. frugiperda_.30 Ecdysteroids **9** to **12** (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract.\n\nFlavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufficient amounts to be bioassayed. The flavonoids quercetin (**25**) and quercetin (**26**) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (**25**) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450-dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione _S_-transferases from _S. frugiperda_.35 In addition, quercetin (**26**), a flavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not significantly different (_P_ < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound **17**, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity.\n\n### _Developmental effects_\n\nIn general, no statistically significant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP-HL and VP-HF, which showed significantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage.\n\nCompound **9**, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statistically significant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (_P_ < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmental stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result.\n\nAlthough the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds **14** and **43** (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins **15** and **17** were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea-Bulla _et al._,38 gallic acid (**13**), the compound isolated from several extracts of _S. densiflora_ and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound **14**, significantly reduces larval growth of _S. frugiperda_ at 1 mg g-1.\n\n## 4 CONCLUSIONS\n\nPolar extracts from _S. densiflora_ and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efficient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of _S. frugiperda_. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin **14** along with the insecticidal effects of flavonoids **25** and **26** might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound **14** might be acting synergistically with **43**, and in concert with daucosterol (**19**), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid **13** and other\n\n## Page 9\n\ncompound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr Fatima R Salimena-Pires (Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora - UFJF) and Marcos Sobral (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG) for botanical identifications, and to ALCOA Alumimio S/A for facilitating plant collections.

The other three are new and their structures are: (22,42)-_N_-isobutyl-5-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-penta-2,4-dienoic amide for isopiperlonguminine; (22,42)-_N_-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-penta-2,4-dienoic amide for corcovadine; and (22,42)-_N_-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-penta-2,4-dienoic amide for isocorcovadine.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n_Ottonia corcovadensis_ Máiq, a herbaceous shrub of the Piperaceae, is known in Brazilian folk medicine under the name of 'false' aboardn'. * Its roots and, to a lesser extent, the stems are chewed to alleviate toothache, due to their anesthetic action on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Extraction of the roots with petrol followed by extensive column chromatography yielded five amides. Piperlonguminine (1) and piperovatine (5) were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples. Piperovatine is the sole substance responsible for the anesthetic activity and was obtained pure by crystallization in a system of solvents at low temperature. The remaining three amides are new, having been named isopiperlonguminine (2), corcovadine (3) and isocorcovadine (4). Piperlonguminine-isopiperlonguminine and corcovadine-isocorcovadine are shown to be pairs of _cis_-_trans_ isomers.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe work was performed with two batches of roots of _O. corcovadensis_ collected at the same site with a 1 year interval. Different extraction procedures were applied to the two batches. In the first process the ground roots were extracted exhaustively with petrol at room temperature; the resulting oily extract was fractionated on a column of silica gel and fractions eluted with solvents of increasing polarity. Piperlonguminine (1) and corcovadine (3) were isolated in this way. With the second batch, extraction was done in a Soxhlet, the extract being chromatographed repeatedly on a series of silica gel columns. By this procedure, all five amides could be isolated. Separation on silica gel proved to be effective, although extremely delicate due to the closeness of the bands. All five amides were eluted with hexane-EtOAc mixtures of composition close to 7:3, thus calling for frequent rec\n\n## Page 2\n\ncrystals, mp 140-143, is herewith described as the corresponding _cis,cis_ isomer. The mass spectra of the compounds are identical; IR and UV spectra are similar. The IR spectra differ notably at 985 cm-1, where only **1** shows a strong absorption peak due to the _trans_ configuration. Comparison of the UV spectra shows essentially a hyposochromic shift of the main absorption band, of the order of 10 nm. Significant differences appear in the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra, where signals in the region of the olefinic protons appear much less complex for **2** than for **1** (see Table 1).\n\nThe positions of the signals agree with those reported for synthetic _cis,cis_-piperic acid [2] and for _cis,cis_-piperine (chavicine) [3]. Doubts about the precise assignments for protons B and C [3] could be dispelled with the aid of the'spin tickling' technique of double resonance. Irradiating the proton corresponding to the most upfield signal (H_A_, d_ \\(S\\) 6.69, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 11 Hz) determines splitting of the signal at d 6.85 (_t_, \\(J\\) = 11 Hz), which must therefore be assigned to Hb. Conversely, irradiation of the most downfield signal (presumably the desibelided Hc, (d 7.45, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 11 Hz) determines splitting of two signals, as would have to be expected, one being due to Hb (already identified) and the other one Hb (d 6.66, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 11 Hz). The observed differences between the spectra of the isomers with respect to the protons b to the amide carbonyl group are consistent in that the uniform shielding in the _trans,trans_ structures suffers a deshielding effect in the _cis,cis_ structures.\n\n### The pair corcovadine-isocorcovadine\n\nCorcovadine (**3**), C18H21O5N, crystals, mp 141-144, exhibits the typical UV absorptions of a piperic acid derivative (see Experimental). The IR spectrum is similar to that of piperidinuminine with respect to the amide function (_v_max 3225 and 1640 cm-1), the _trans_ configuration of the olefinic double bonds (1000 cm-1) and the methylenedioxy group (925 cm-1). A second carbonyl function is revealed by a strong absorption at 1710 cm-1, which can be attributed to the presence of an acetoxy group. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum also very much resembles that of piperidinuminine with respect to the pipette acid moiety (see Table 1). In addition, there are signals for geminal methyl groups (6 H, _s_) at d 1.46; methylene protons (2 H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 6 Hz) at d 3.59, coupled with the proton at the nitrogen (1 H, _br._), at d 6.23. A single signal (3H, _s_) at d 2.02 is again indicative of an acetoxy group, which was also confirmed by the mass spectrum: with a fragmentation pattern similar to that of piperidinuminine, it shows an additional significant peak at _m_/_z_ 271 (M+ - 60; 14 %), corresponding to the loss of one acetic acid molecule from the molecular ion. Other fragments were typical of amides derived from piperic acid. On the basis of these data, structure **3** was assigned to corcovadine. Chemical confirmation was obtained through alkaline hydrolysis, producing the amide **6**, with a tertiary hydroxyl group, and piperic acid.\n\nSpectral comparisons analogous to those discussed for piperidinuminine and isoperlopenynimine allowed for correlation of corcovadine (**3**) with its isomer, isocorcovadine (**4**), C18H21O5N, crystals, mp 80-85deg. The absence, in the IR spectrum of the latter, of an absorption in the region of 970-990 cm-1 points to the absence of double bonds in a _trans_ configuration. The _cis_ configuration receives support from similarities in the UV and \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra to those of isoperlopenynimine (**2**) (see Table 1 and Experimental). Mass spectral fragmentations of **3** and **4** are identical.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL\n\nMps were determined on a Kofler hot stage and are uncorr. UV spectra were obtained in MeOH and IR spectra in KBr unless otherwise stated. \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra were measured at 100 MHz and MS at 70eV. Column chromatography was performed on Si gel, and TLC on Si gel H and GF254 (Merck). The identity of compounds, whenever stated, was established by direct comparison with authentic samples through mp, mmp, UV, IR, \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR and MS, as well as TLC.\n\n_Plant material._ Two batches of _O. corcovadensis_ were collected at the hillside of the Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, in December, at a 1 year interval.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c} R Compound & Configuration & A & B & C & D & E & F \\\\ CH2CHMe2 & Piperlonguminine (**1**) & _trans_, _trans_ & 5.90 (_d_) & 7.38 (_m_) & —* & — & — & 5.94 (_s_) \\\\ \\(J\\) = 15 & & & & & & & \\\\ CH2CHMe2 & Isopiperlonguminine (**2**) _cis,cis_ & 5.69 (_d_) & 6.85 (_t_) & 7.45 (_t_) & 6.66 (_d_) & 6.78 (_s_) & 5.96 (_s_) \\\\ \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & & \\\\ CH2CMe2OAc & Corcovadine (**3**) & _trans,trans_ & 5.94 (_d_) & 7.40 (_m_) & — & — & — & 5.95 (_s_) \\\\ \\(J\\) = 15 & & & & & & & \\\\ CH2CMe2OAc & Isocorcovadine (**4**) & _cis,cis_ & 5.69 (_d_) & 6.91 (_t_) & 7.44 (_t_) & 6.64 (_d_) & 6.76 (_s_) & 5.93 (_s_) \\\\ \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & \\(J\\) = 11 & & \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectral data of the two pairs of isomeric piperic acid amides from _O. corcovadensis_ (100 MHz, solvent CDCl3, chemical shifts in ppm, d units, \\(J\\) in Hz)\n\n## Page 3\n\n_Extraction and separation_ I. The dried, powdered roots (1600 g) were exhaustively extracted by maceration with petrol. The combined extracts (221) were coned under red. pres. to give a dark green viscous mass (7.09 b). The material was treated with Me2CO and the soluble portion was again evapd to dryness under red. pres. The dark oily residue (5.86 g) was chromatographed on a Si gel column (350 g) and developed with solvent mixtures of increasing polarity. Toluene-EtOAc (19:1) eluted piperlongumine (I, 36 mg). Elution with toluene-EtOAc 9:1 and 4:1 afforded fractions which were combined and submitted to the same procedure. Repeated chromatography followed by five recrystallizations from MeOH yielded corcovadine (3, 58 mg). Although these last fractions were strongly anesthetizing to the tongue, separation of the active material could not be achieved.\n\n_Extraction and separation_ II. The dried, powdered roots (1900 g) were extracted with petrol in a Soxhlet until the extract was clear (72 hr.) The filtered extract was coned under red. pres., yielding a dark green viscous oil (22 g). The material was chromatographed on a column of Si gel (300 g) and developed first with hexane, followed by solvent mixtures of increasing polarity, through toluene, EtOAc and MeOH. This procedure resulted in the separation of four crude fractions, of which only one, the one eluted with EtOAc, showed anesthetic activity. The fractions were repeatedly rechromatographed, monitoring the procedure by means of TLC. In this, visualization of all the compounds in UV light was very helpful: the _trans_ compounds showed intense, blue fluorescence, while the _cis_ compounds were detached from the background as dark spots. Eventually, all five amides were separated in this way. Solvents for crystallization were: toluene for piperonguminine; hexane-EtOAc (2:1) for isopiperlonguminine; MeOH for corcovadine; hexane-EtOAc (4:1) for isocorcovadine; MeOH for piperovatine. All were obtained as colourless crystals.\n\n_Piperolongumine_ (I). Mp 167-169* (lit. [1] 166-168*).

Vieira\n\nPermanent address: Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, CEP 13560, Brazil.\n\nIsao Kubo\n\n###### Abstract\n\nFour quinoline alkaloids were isolated from stems of _Galipea bracteata_. In addition to one new compound, 2-(3,_A_'-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)-quinoline, three were identified as the known compounds 2-_n_-propylquinoline, 2-_n_-pentylquinoline and 2-(1'-pentenyl)-quinoline. However, this is the first report of their isolation from a natural source. All alkaloids showed an inhibitory effect on shoot and root growth of lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_). Three of them also showed molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail, _Biomphalaria glabrata_, involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Rutaceae is represented by a great number of species in tropical areas. Many of these species have never been the target of a photochemical investigation. In our continuing effort to find biologically active compounds we have investigated _Galipea bracteata_. In this paper we report the isolation and identification of one new alkaloid and three known ones from _G. bracteata_ collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The growth inhibitory effect against lettuce of the alkaloids, as well as, their molluscicidal activity are also described.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe dichloromethane extract of the stems of _G. bracteata_ afforded four alkaloids 1-**4**. The combination of various routine 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectrometric analyses allowed us to attribute the formulas C12H13N. C14H17N. C14H15N and C18H15NO2 to compounds 1-**4**, respectively. 1H NMR (Table 1) showed signals of six aromatic protons for all compounds at \\(\\delta 7.24 + 0.04\\), \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-3; \\(\\delta 8.02 + 0.02\\)_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz, H-4; \\(\\delta 7.74 + 0.02\\)_dd_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-5; \\(\\delta 7.47 + 0.04\\)_td_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-6; \\(\\delta 7.66 + 0.04\\)_td_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-7 and \\(\\delta 8.01 + 0.01\\)_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.8, H-8. An exception was the signal corresponding to H-3 of compound 3 at \\(\\delta 7.51\\). The similarities of the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the four compounds suggest that a 2-substituted quinoline system is the structural basis for all compounds, and that the difference between them is the type of substituent attached to C-2. Compound **1** possesses a _n_-propyl moiety characterized by the signals in the 1H NMR at \\(\\delta 2.91\\) (_t_), \\(\\delta 1.81\\) (_sext_, \\(J\\) = 7.4 Hz), \\(\\delta 0.91\\) (_t_), integrating 2:2:3, respectively. Confirmation of this unit can be taken from the 13C NMR signals at \\(\\delta 41.30\\), \\(23.25\\) and \\(13.99\\), which can be attributed to C-1', C-2' and C-3', respectively.\n\nCompounds **2** and **3** are very closely related to each other and to compound **1**. The mass spectra showed the parent peak at _m_/2 199 and 197 for **2** and **3** respectively, indicating that the difference between **2** and **3** is two hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the 1H NMR of both compounds showed that **2** has two more signals in the olefinic region [\\(\\delta 6.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n= 7.8, 1.2 Hz), as well as by the presence of a methylenedioxy ring assigned to the signal at \\(d\\) 5.90 integrating for two protons. The presence of a piperonyl moiety is once more confirmed by the mass spectrum which show-cd a peak at _m_/_z_ 135. The parent peak of _m_/_z_ 277 requires a methylenedioxyphenylethyl as the substituent of this quinoline. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. The compounds 2-methyl(**5**) and 2-aminoquinoline(**6**) were used as models [1,2].\n\nThe alkaloids isolated showed inhibitory effects on the growth of lettuce seedlings and molluscicidal activity as determined according to the methods described previously [3,4]. All compounds at concentrations larger than 500 ppm inhibited both shoot and root growth in the lettuce test. At lower concentrations their activities were diminished. When the concentration was decreased to 100 ppm, only compounds **3** and **4** showed activity but at this concentration, **1** and **2** had no activity.\n\nMolluscicidal activity was exhibited by compounds **2**-**4**. Compound **1** was not molluscicidal even at 100 ppm. Compound **4** had the most powerful molluscicidal activity killing snails at a concentration of only 5 ppm. Compounds **2** and **3** possessed activities at 20 and 10 ppm, respectively.\n\nOur results suggest that the presence of a second aromatic ring at C-2 increases the activity of the compounds, and that the activity of 2-alkylquinolines depends on the length of the alkyl chain. It is important to note that very few examples of naturally occurring alkaloids have been found to exhibit molluscicidal activity [5], although recently, some potent molluscicidal alkaloids were isolated from members of the Meliaceae [6]. It is also important to mention that few species of the genus _Galipea_ have been studied. However, in a unique example presented by Mester [7], the alkaloids isolated were 2-substituted quinolines. We suspect that there should be a tendency for this genus to produce this class of compound.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Isolation of constituents. Galipea bracetata\n\nwas collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil, a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias, USP, Sao Paulo. Dried stems (920 g) were extd with CH2Cl2 at room temp. for 4 days. The ext was evapd to dryness yielding (5.567 g) of crude extract. A portion of this ext (1.463 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (50 g) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2, EtOHAc and MeOH). Alkaloids were found in fs 16-35. They were then sepd by low pressure chromatography on silica gel (Lichropenyl using hexane-EtOAc (49:1), affording **1** (31 mg), **2** (10 mg), **3** (15 mg) and **4** (113 mg).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n2-n-_Propylquinoline_ (1) [83].

The genus _Styrax_ is different from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammatory diseases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styracaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985; Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988; Anil, 1980; Segal et al., 1967, 1964; Ulubelen et al., 1978; Kawai and Sugimoto, 1940; Kitagawa et al., 1974; Ulubelen, 1976; Nakano et al., 1967).\n\nFrom the leaves of _Styrax ferrugineus_ Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**4**) and the known _nor_-lignans 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**1**), 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**2**), 5-(3\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),4\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**3**) and the lignan dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (**5**), together with ursoclinic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds **1-2** showed inhibitory properties against the microorganisms, _Candida albicans, Cladosporium cladesoporiades_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_, whereas compounds **3-5** inhibited only _S. aureus_ and _C. albicans_. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elucidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and 2).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves of _Styrax ferrugineus_ were extracted with a mixture of CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)--CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH (2:1 v/v). Evaporation gave an extract, which showed\n\n## Page 2\n\nantimicrobial activity, detected by inhibition of _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ (Table 3). The bioactive extract was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with _n_-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOHAc (4x300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by purification on preparative HPLC afforded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (**4**) and the known _nor_-lignans (**1**) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (**2**) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and (**3**) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (**5**) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identified by chromatographic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The triterpenes and sterols were identified by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13C NMR spectral data for 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-methylene-dioxyphenyl)benzofuran (**1**) and 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (**2**). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13C NMR spectral data for **1** and **2** are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC correlations are presented in Fig. 1.\n\nCompound **2** was obtained earlier from the seeds of _S. officinalis_ (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent purification of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of _S. camporum_ (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucidation of compound (**4**) as well as the antimicrobial activities of all lignoids isolated.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The molecular formula C26H32O10 was deduced from ES-MS _m_/_z_ [M + Na]+ 527, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. Its IR spectrum recorded hydroxyl (3550-3200 cm 1), unsaturated (1650 cm 1) and aromatic (1550, 870 cm 1) absorptions, and its UV absorbance\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline Carbon & **1a** & **2b** & **4c** \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 156.06 \\(s\\) & 156.35 \\(s\\) & 156.12 \\(s\\) \\\\\n3 & 100.32 \\(d\\) & 100.27 \\(d\\) & 101.12 \\(d\\) \\\\\n4 & 112.28 \\(d\\) & 112.28 \\(d\\) & 112.12 \\(d\\) \\\\\n5 & 137.50 \\(s\\) & 137.49 \\(s\\) & 137.85 \\(s\\) \\\\\n6 & 1\n\n## Page 3\n\n(MeOH) was at 312.0 and 216.5 nm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Tables 1 and 2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of **4** with those described for **2** indicated that **4** is a glucoside derivative of compound **2**. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum of **4** displayed four doublets at \\(\\delta\\) 6.77 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 7.44 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 1.9; 8.0 Hz) attributable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 7.17 (1H, _s_) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at \\(\\delta\\) 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, _s_), two triplets due to methylene protons at \\(\\delta\\) 2.75 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at \\(\\delta\\) 1.86 (2H, _dt_, \\(J\\) = 7.8 Hz). This \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of compound **2**. Further analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 4.11 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) and several signals at \\(\\delta\\) 4.33-3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound **4**. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **4** (Table 2) suggested the presence of a _nor_-ligman with similar skeleton to **2**. The main difference observed in the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **4** was due to the presence of the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH\\({}_{2}\\)) which confirmed a glucosyl moiety. The \\({}^{1}\\)H--\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{13}\\)C-three-bond (HMBC) correlations from the H-\\({}^{1\\prime\\prime}\\) protons resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 107.64 and 112.12 identified the later as C-4. The \\({}^{3}\\)_J_ HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and C-4\\({}^{\\prime}\\) quaternary carbons with H-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\) proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-tri-substituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound **4**. Other significant correlations for confirmation of **4** are depicted in Fig. 1.\n\nThe extract and compounds isolated from _S. ferrugineus_ were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_, respectively. Compounds **1-2** exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against _C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_, whereas compounds **3-5** inhibited only _S. aureus_ and _C. albicans_. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ could be predictive for the activity against _C. albicans_. In conclusion, the activities of compounds **1-5** may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infections in several Brazilian regions.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and 50 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for \\({}^{1}\\)H and 100 MHz for \\({}^{13}\\)C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\), respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70-230 and 230-400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F\\({}_{254}\\) plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) after heating.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Styrax ferrugineus_ Ness et Mart.

Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Bioassay\n\nThe crude extract and purified lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium _S. aureus_ ATCC 12228, the fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast _C. albicans_ ICB 12. Stock solutions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure compounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appropriate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on pre-coated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as positive and negative controls, respectively. For the antifungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of _C. sphaerospermum_ in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 27degC. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with _C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of _C. albicans_ and _S. aureus_ in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30degC for 24 h.\n\n### Extraction\n\nDried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of _Styrax ferrugneus_ Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2-CH3OH (2:1, v/v) at room temperature. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH-H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOHAc. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respectively. The CHCl3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel flash (77.9 g, 230-400 mesh, Merck) using a CH2Cl2-CH3OH gradient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran **(1)**, and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(3''-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran **(2)**. Fr. 40-41 (39.4 mg) was fractionated by micron silica gel flash CC (Merck) using CH2Cl2-CH3OH (95:5) as eluent to afford 11 Frs. Frs. 5-9 gave a mixture of unsolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52-55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica flash CC (11.6 g, 230-400 mesh, Merck) using Hex-EtoAc-CH3OH (6:2:2) as eluent to afford 20 Frs. Frs 6-12 furnished dihydrohedjcolorifyl alcohol **(5)** (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH2Cl2-CH3OH gradient yielded 22 Frs. Fr. 20 (13.8 mg) gave a mixture of **3** + **4**, which was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-18 column) using a mixture of CH3OH-H2O (4:6) as eluent to afford compounds **3** (4.0 mg) and **4** (5.8 mg).\n\n#### 3.4.1 5-(3''-Hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3',4'-methyl-lenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1)\n\nWhite amorphous powder; IR _v_max (KBr) 3432, 2926, 1606, 1476, 1232, 1148, 1037, 931 cm 1; ES-MS [M + Na]+ _m_/_z_ 349, ES-MS [M + K]+ _m_/_z_ 365.

These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide _N_-[7-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_),4(_Z_)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of _Piper hispidum_ H.B.K. (Alecio et al., 1998).\n\nIn this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elucidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (_3Z_,_5Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptacionamide (**1**), (_S_Z_)-N_-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-D\\({}^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one (**2**) and also of eight known antifungal amides _N_-[3-(6'-methoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_)-propenoylpyrrolidine (**3**), piperamine (**4**), _N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-D\\({}^{3}\\) -pyridin-2-one (**5**), piperatine (**6**), piperine (**7**), D\\({}^{\\alpha,\\beta,}\\)-dihydropyiperine (**8**), 5,6-dihydropyiperlonguminine (**9**) and pellitorine (**10**). The amides isolated from stems of _Piper hispidum_ (**1**, **3** and **4**) and from seeds of _Piper tuberculatum_ (**2**, **5-10**) were active against the fungus _Cladosporium sphareospermum_ as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nA CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of _P. hispidum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by HPLC purification to afford the compounds **1, 3** and **4**.\n\nCompound **1**, has a molecular formula C\\({}_{18}\\)H\\({}_{23}\\)NO\\({}_{3}\\) as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) and of the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cm \\({}^{1}\\). Its \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at \\(d\\) 5.91 (2H, _s_), and four olefine protons which showed signals at \\(d\\) 5.45 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)3,4 = 12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)4,3 and 4,5 = 12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)5,4 and 5,6 = 12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, _dt_, \\(J\\)6,5 and 6,7 = 12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that both double bonds\n\n## Page 2\n\npossess the Z configuration (Alecio et al., 1998; Shah et al. 1986). The assignments of these olefinic protons were confirmed by analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylene protons H-8 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.62 (2H, \\(t\\), \\(J_{8,7}\\) = 7.0 Hz) and H-7 at \\(\\delta\\) 2.46 (2H, m) were confirmed by the DQ-COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 5.94, 1H) could be also observed.\n\nThe presence of a isobutyl moiety was confirmed by the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.13 (2H, \\(dd\\), \\(J_{1^{\\prime},2^{\\prime}}\\) = 7.0 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 1.80 (1H, \\(m\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 0.92 (6H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{3^{\\prime},2^{\\prime}\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nexchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of **1** are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-field region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at \\(d\\) 166.5, ten olefinic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [d_C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at \\(d\\) 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (Alecio et al., 1998; Araujo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of **1** was determined as (3\\(Z\\),5_Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide.\n\nA CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of _P. tuberculatum_ was fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to afford compounds **2** and **5-10**.\n\nCompound **2**, was shown to have a molecular formula C17H19NO5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) and of 13C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cm 1 (asymmetric C-O-C stretching). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** revealed the presence of methoxyphenyl groups by the signals at \\(d\\) 3.84 (6H, _s_), \\(d\\) 3.85 (3H, _s_), one aromatic proton signal at \\(d\\) 6.76 (2H, _s_) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four olefinic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spectrum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at \\(d\\) 6.48 assigned to H-8 (_J_8,9 = 12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at \\(d\\) 6.71 assigned to H-9 (_J_9,8 = 12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the \\(Z\\) configuration. The attribution of this configuration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the \\(Z\\) isomer when compared with the \\(E\\) isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at \\(d\\) 5.98 (_J_3,4 and 3,5 = 9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at \\(d\\) 6.89 (_J_4,3 and 4,5 = 9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at \\(d\\) 5.98 (_J_3,4 and 3,5 = 9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at \\(d\\) 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at \\(d\\) 3.97 (_J_6,5 = 7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-field region of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four olefinic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at \\(d\\) 165.7 and 168.1. The assignments\n\n## Page 4\n\nof the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at \\(d\\) 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at \\(d\\) 6.48 (H-8) and \\(d\\) 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at \\(d\\) 165.7 was assigned to C-2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at \\(d\\) 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-field region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [_d_c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at \\(d\\) 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide **2** was defined as 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-D3-pyridin-2-one.\n\n_N_- (12, 13, 14- Trimethoxyphenylhydrocinnamoyl)-D3 -pyridin -2- one (**5**), D_a_b_- dihydropyiperine (**8**) and 5,6-dihydropyiperlonguminine (**9**) have the molecular formula C17H21NO5, C17H21NO3 and C16H21NO3, respectively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from _Piper rugosum_ (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), _Piper guineense_ (Parmar et al., 1997) and _P. tuberculatum_ (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the first time.\n\n_N_-[3-(6'-methoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenyl]pyrrolidine (**3**) was previously isolated from _Piper pequloides_ (Shah et al., 1986) and _P. hispidum_ (Alecio et al., 1998). Piperamine (**4**) was previously obtained from _Piper nigrum_ (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and _P. hispidum_ (Alecio et al., 1998). Piplartine (**6**) was previously described from _Piper aborescens_ (Duh et al., 1990) and _P. tuberculatum_ (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (**7**) was previously described from _P. aborescens_ and _P. tuberculatum_ (Araujo-Junior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (**10**) had been reported from _Cissampelos glaberrina_ (Rosario et al., 1996).\n\nThe antifungal activity of amides **1-10** was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds **1-10** are shown in Table 3 and were performed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of _C. sphaerospermum_ growth at that level were considered inactive.\n\nThe minimum quantity of compounds **1-4**, **6**, **8-10** necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for **7** and **5** the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively. The values for **7** and **5** were comparable to those observed for the reference compounds miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg).\n\n_P. hispidum_ and _P. tuberculatum_ have accumulated amides with _cis_ geometry in their side chain, which is a structural feature quite rare in nature (Alecio et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1986).\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and sol\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline Carbons & **5** & **8** & **9** \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 165.4 (s) & 43.0 (t) & 166.0 (s) \\\\\n3 & 125.8 (d) & 25.5 (t) & 120.8 (d) \\\\\n4 & 145.2 (d) & 24.6 (t) & 142.6 (d) \\\\\n5 & 24.6 (t) & 26.7 (t) & 33.8 (t) \\\\\n6 & 41.0 (t) & 46.8 (t) & 34.1 (t) \\\\\n\n## Page 5\n\nvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reverse phase column (Waters Nova Pack, C18; 3.9 x 150 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (3:2), flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 260 nm. Elemental analysis were performed on a Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Piper hispidum_ H.B.K. stems were collected in Parque Estadual do Morro do Diabo, Teodoro Sampaio, SP and identified by Dr. Waldir Mantovani (Instituto de Biociencias -- USP). _P. tuberculatum_ Jacq. seeds were collected in the Campus do INPA (Manaus) and identified by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias -- USP, Sao Paulo.\n\n### Antifungal assay\n\nThe microorganism used in the antifungal assay _C.phaerospermum_ (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay -- 10 ul of solutions corresponding to 100 ug of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 ug of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of _C. spharoospermum_ in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25degC. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the minimal amount of **1-10** required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 ug) and miconazole (0.5 ug) were used as positive controls.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nThe dried and powdered stems of _P. hispidum_ (28.0 g) were extracted with CH2Cl2 (3x150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give **1** (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give **3** (0.004 g). Frs containing **4** were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of _P. tuberculatum_ (24.3 g) were extracted CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 x 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromatographic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **2** (0.024 g) and **6** (0.003 g). Fraction 20 (0.146 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **5** (0.005 g). Fraction 19 (0.083 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions] to yield **7** (0.012 g) and **8** (0.007 g). Frs. 8 and 13 yielded **10** (0.079 g) and **9** (0.018 g), respectively.\n\n### (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxy-phenyl)-heptadienamide (1)\n\nFound: C, 71.54; H, 7.56; N, 4.45; O, 16.43%.

Rev. B\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAs part of our continuous investigation into the chemical composition of Brazilian _Neoraputia_ (Engler) Emmerich species, we recently reported the isolation of eight polymethoxylated flavones and one flavanone from _N. alba_ (Engler) Emmerich (Arruda et al., 1991, 1993), four polymethoxylated flavones, 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone (**1**) and 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5'-tetraethoxy-5',6'-(2'',2''-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (**2**) from _N. magnifica_ var. _magnifica_ (Engler) Emmerich (Passador et al., 1997). The isolation of these interesting new chalcones combined with our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae stimulated an investigation of other organs of _N. magnifica_ var. _magnifica_.\n\nChagas' disease, caused by the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people,mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organization). Control of the insect vector (_Triotoma infestans_) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side effects (Souza et al., 1998). The bloodstream form of the parasite _T. cruzi_ has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production (Souza et al., 1998). This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined (Souza et al., 1998). GAPDH catalyses the \n\n## Page 2\n\noxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with significant differences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested. In order to find blocking agents, chalcones and flavones isolated from _N. magnifica_ were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from _T. cruzi_.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe hexane extract of the ripe fruits of _N. magnifica_ var. _magnifica_, afforded _g_-tocopherol and three chalcones. One was characterised as 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tet-menthoxy-5',6'-(2'',2''-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (**2**) by comparison with both published data and an authentic sample (Passador et al., 1997). Placement of the chromene ring between C-5' and O-6' in **2** was determined on the basis of the following data. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed features of a chromene ring (_d_ 6.60 and 5.47 vinylic protons, and a singlet at \\(d\\) 1.50, 6H, assigned to a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups) and signals for four methoxy groups. The assignment of one singlet to H-2 and H-6 (_d_ 6.86, 2H) suggested that three methoxy groups are attached to the B-ring. From a biosynthetic point of view, the remaining methoxy group could be attached to C-4' or C-6' of the A-ring. The spectrum also revealed a singlet at \\(d\\) 14.24 corresponding to one chelated hydroxyl, thus attached to C-2'. Furthermore, a singlet at \\(d\\) 6.07 (1H) clearly indicated the A-ring to be 2',4',5',6'- or 2',3',4',6'- tetrasubstituted. From the HMBC experiments (Table 2) the observed correlations between the hydroxyl proton at \\(d\\) 14.24 and the 13C signals at \\(d\\) 105.9 (_J_3), 167.9\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} H & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** \\\\ \\hline\n3′ & 6.2 \\(d\\) (2.4) & 6.07 \\(s\\) & 6.06 _s\n\n## Page 3\n\n(\\(J^{2}\\)) and 92.5 (\\(J^{3}\\)) led to their assignments as C-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\), C-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and C-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\), respectively, thus indicating that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\). The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum (Table 3) showed a signal for only one methoxy group attached to the _ortho_-disubstituted carbon (\\(\\delta\\) 63.1) which was assigned to the 4-OMe functionality. This implies that the methoxy group in the A-ring is located at C-4\\({}^{\\prime}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 55.9), and therefore established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and O-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\). Moreover, the existence of any correlation between the \\({}^{1}\\)H signal at \\(\\delta\\) 6.07, assigned to H-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\) (by HSQC and HMBC), and the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(\\delta\\) 102.9 (C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\)), confirmed the position of the chromene ring between C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and O-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\). The mass spectrum and elemental analysis data for **2** are reported here for the first time (see also Scheme 1 and Section 3).\n\nChalcone (**3**) exhibited similar NMR spectra to that of **2** (Tables 1 and 3). In addition to signals described for the A-ring of **2**, the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a 1,4-disubstituted phenyl moiety (\\(\\delta\\) 7.56 \\(d\\), \\(J\\)= 8.6 Hz, H-2 and H-6; 6.93 \\(d\\), \\(J\\)= 8.6 Hz, H-3 and H-5). The presence of a fragment ion at \\(m\\)/\\(z\\) 161 (Scheme 1) in the mass spectrum for **3**, associated with cleavage between the A-ring and C-\\(\\beta^{\\prime}\\), clearly indicated the presence of one methoxy group in the B-ring. The signal of H-2/H-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 7.56) showed a one-bond correlation (by HSQC) with the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(\\delta\\) 130.0, and a long-range correlation (by HMBC, Table 2) with the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(\\delta\\)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l l} \\hline C & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & C & **5** & **6** & **7** & **8** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 131.2 & 130.8 & 128.4 & 128.0 & 2 & 160.5 & 160.7 & 160.8 & 160.2 \\\\\n2 & 105.7 & 105.3 & 130.0 & 109.4 & 3 & 108.9 & 107.8 & 107.5 & 108.7\n\n## Page 4\n\n161.1 (\\(J^{3}\\)), thus indicating the methoxy group to be located at C-4 and permitting the assignment of the signal at \\(d\\) 161.1 to C-4. HSQC experiments also showed correlations of the signal of H-3/H-5 (_d_ 6.93) with the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(d\\) 114.5. In addition, the signal of H-a (_d_ 8.02) showed cross peaks with the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(d\\) 128.4, indicating this signal to C-1.\n\nFor **2**, placement of the chromene ring was apparent from the \\(J^{3}\\) couplings observed between the hydroxyl proton (2'-OH) and the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal for C-3', indicating that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-2'. HMBC experiments with **3** did not detect any correlations of the hydroxyl signal with the A-ring carbons. However, the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **3** (Table 3) revealed resonances for C-1' to C-6' and C-1'' to C-5'' in close agreement with the resonances for the corresponding carbons in **2**. A singlet at \\(d\\) 6.06 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(d\\) 92.7, permitting the assignment of these signals to H-3' and C-3', respectively, when compared with **2**. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **3** did not show any signal for methoxy groups attached to the _ortho_-disubstituted carbon (ca \\(d\\) 63); they were observed at \\(d\\) 55.4 and 55.8. This implies that the methoxy in the A-ring was located at C-4' and established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-5' and O-6'. The signals at \\(d\\) 55.4 and 55.8 were then assigned to 4'-OMe and/or 4-OMe. Based on the above evidence, the correlations from H-3' to the \\({}^{13}\\)C signals of C-5' (_d_ 103.1) and C-1' (_d_ 106.4) were consistent with the angular structure for **3**. The new natural product is, therefore, 2'-hydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxy-5',6'-(2'',2''-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (**3**).\n\nChalcone (**4**) also showed spectral characteristics of a 2'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-5',6'-(2'',2''-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (Tables 1 and 3). HMBC experiments (Table 2) with **4** also did not detect a relationship between the 2'-OH signal at \\(d\\) 14.34 to the A-ring carbons. However, the chemical shifts of the A-ring and chromene carbons were comparable with those for **2** and **3** (Table 3). As discussed above, the signals of the methoxy groups at \\(d\\) 55.8 and 56.1 (6H) supported the chromene ring to be between C-5' and O-6'. This was also confirmed by the HMBC experiments, which showed correlations of the H-3' signal (_d_ 6.07) with the resonances of C-2' (_d_ 167.4) and C-1' (_d_ 106.3).\n\nThe mass spectrum of **4** gave significant fragments for _m/z_ 191 and 233 (Scheme 1) requiring the presence of two methoxy groups in the B-ring. This was supported by the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum which showed signals for three methoxy groups (_d_ 3.94, 3H, \\(s\\); 3.93, 3H, \\(s\\); 3.86, 3H, _s_) and for three protons giving rise to an AB spin system (_d_ 7.16, _d, J_ = 2.0 Hz, H-2; \\(d\\) 6.90, _d, J_ = 8.3 Hz, H-5; \\(d\\) 7.20, _dd, J_ = 2.0 and 8.3 Hz, H-6). From the HMBC experiments (Table 2), the observed correlation \n\n## Page 5\n\nbetween the b-proton at d 7.76 and the 13C signals at d 109.4 (_J_3) and 123.3 (_J_3) led to their assignments as C-2 and C-6, respectively. The spectrum also showed a correlation of H-6 at d 7.20 with the 13C signal at d 149.0 (_J_3), confirming a methoxy group at C-4 and showing that this signal can be attributed to C-4. The existence of a correlation between the 1H signal at d 7.16, assigned to H-2, and the 13C signal at d 153.4 determined the position of the other methoxy group at C-3 and permitted the assignment of this signal to C-3. The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4'-trimethoxy-5',6'-(2'',2''-dimethylpyrano) chalcone (**4**).\n\nIt has been noted that the H-b and C-b of a chalcone are more deshielded than the H-a and C-a resonances (Agrawal, 1989). Both are affected by changes in the B-ring substitution and C-a also by the presence or absence of a 2'- or 6'-oxysubstituent. HSQC experiments of 1-**4** showed correlations of 1H signals at ca d 8.0 and 7.7 to the 13C signals at ca d 126 and 142, respectively, indicating apparent anomalies. The methine proton at ca d 7.7 showed cross peaks with the C-2 and C-6 signals (Table 2), so permitting the assignment of the upfield signal at ca d 7.7 to H-b. The anisotropic effect of the 5',O-6'-chromene substituent on the H-a caused a downfield shift above the usual range for 2',6'-oxysubstituted chalcones, this resulting in the H-a proton being more deshielded than H-b.\n\nThe dichloromethane extract of fruits on successive chromatographic separation afforded the five flavonoids, 3',4',5',5',7-pentamethoxyflavanone (Passador et al., 1997), 3',4',5',5',7-pentamethoxyflavone (**5**) (Passador et al., 1997), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5',5,6,7-tetramethylavone (**6**) (Arruda et al., 1993), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (**7**), and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone (**8**). The latter appears to be new.\n\nCompound **6** has been isolated from _Agteratum convizoides_ (Vyas and Mulchandani, 1986) and _N. alba_ (Arruda et al., 1993); however, its 13C NMR data are reported here for the first time (Table 4). The HSQC and HMBC experiments on **6**, permitted the assignments of all carbons (Tables 2 and 3). A singlet at d 6.55 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C signal at d 107.8, and a long-range correlation with the 13C signals at d 126.0 (_J_3), 160.7 (_J_2), 177.1 (_J_2) and 112.9 (_J_3) permitting their assignments as H-3, C-3, C-1', C-2, C-4 and C-10, respectively. Two doublets at d 7.06 and 7.07 were coupled to each other and showed a long-range correlation with the C-2 and C-1' signals, thus indicating these two hydrogens were attached to C-2' and C-6'. The 1H NMR spectrum revealed a signal for three methoxy groups at d 3.98 (6H) and 3.99 (3H); however, in HSQC (d 62.2, 56.9, 56.3) and HMBC experiments these signals appeared as a broad singlet. The observed correlations between the methoxy protons at d 3.98/or 3.99 and the 13C signal at d 143.8 (_J_3), which showed cross peaks with the 1H signal at d 7.07, led to their assignments as 5'-OMe, C-5' and H-6'. The signal at d 7.06 was then assigned to H-2'. HSQC experiments permitted the assignments of 13C signal at d 100.4, 106.6 and 56.3/or 56.9 to C-2', C-6' and 5'-OMe, respectively. HMBC experiments also confirmed the B-ring to have a methylenedioxy group between C-3' and C-4' by the cross peaks with the 1H signal of OCH2O at d 6.08 with the 13C signals at d 149.5 and 138.1, which showed correlations with H-2' and the latter (d 138.1) with H-6'. The signals at d 149.5 and 138.1 were then assigned to C-3' and C-4', respectively. The 13C signal at d 102.2 could be attributed to OCH2O by HSQC.\n\nThe 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for two methoxy groups at d 61.5 and 62.2. Thus implies that the methoxy groups in the A-ring are located at C-5, C-6 and C-7, since the 1H signal at d 6.78 (1H) for the unsubstituted methine indicated that this proton must not be vicinal to C=O (C-4). Thus, the observed one-bond correlation between the signal of H-8 (d 6.78) and the 13C signal at d 96.2 led to the assignment of C-8 to this resonance. The methoxy protons at d 3.92 showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C signal at d 61.5, and a long-range correlation with the 13C signal at d 140.4 (_J_3), suggesting the assignment of the latter signal to C-6 or C-5. The presence of a correlation between the signal of H-8 and the 13C signal at d 140.4 (_J_3) clearly indicated this signal to be at C-6. The signal for C-7 was established as d 157.7 by the existence of a correlation\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound & Concentration (μg/ml) & Absorbance & Specific activity (U/mg) & \\% Inhibitory activity \\\\\n**5** & 30 & 0.345 & 24.65 & 46 \\\\  & 50 & 0.136 & 9.72 & 80 \\\\  & 100 & 0.009 & 0.64 & 99 \\\\ Control & 30 & 0.641 & 45.80 & \\\\  & 50 & 0.670 & 47.87 & \\\\  & 100 & 0.560 & 40.01 & \\\\\n**6** + **7** & 25 & 0.343 & 20.24 & 54 \\\\\n\n## Page 6\n\nbetween the H-8 resonance and this \\({}^{13}\\)C signal (\\(J^{2}\\)), which also showed a cross peak with the methoxy protons at \\(\\delta\\) 3.98/or 3.99 and the latter with the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(\\delta\\) 56.3 or 56.9. In the same way, the signal for C-5 emerged from analysis of the correlation between the methoxy signal at \\(\\delta\\) 3.98/or 3.99 (\\(\\delta\\) 62.2 by HSQC) and the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(\\delta\\) 152.6, which did not show a correlation with the H-8 signal. The H-8 signal also showed a cross-peak with the \\({}^{13}\\)C signal at \\(\\delta\\) 154.4 (\\(J^{2}\\)), which was attributed to C-9, since it was the only carbon to be assigned in the A-ring.\n\nFlavone **8** exhibited a B-ring spin system in the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum for 3',4'-substitution (\\(\\delta\\) 7.54, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 1.8 and 0.4 Hz, H-2'; \\(\\delta\\) 6.98, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 8.1 and 0.4 Hz, H-5'; \\(\\delta\\) 7.51, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 8.1 and 1.8, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for a _meta_-coupled A-ring protons (\\(\\delta\\) 6.55, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.3 Hz, H-6; \\(\\delta\\) 6.78, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.3 Hz, H-8), two methoxy groups (\\(\\delta\\) 3.85, \\(s\\), 6H) and one methylenedioxy group (\\(\\delta\\) 6.07, \\(s\\), 2H). The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) (Chen et al., 1997) fragments of this flavone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B-rings (Scheme 2). Thus, a combination of \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectral data and the fragment ions at \\(m/z\\) 146 (70%) and 180 (5%) fully support the presence of a 3',4'-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and a 5,7-dimethoxy system in the A-ring.\n\nHSQC experiments permitted assignments of all protonated carbons (Table 3). However, the \\({}^{13}\\)C signals at \\(\\delta\\) 96.8 and 93.7 were attributed to C-6 and C-8, and the \\({}^{1}\\)H signals at \\(\\delta\\) 6.55 and 6.78 to H-6 and H-8, respectively, by comparison with the resonances for the corresponding carbons and hydrogens in 3',4',5',5',5'-pentamethoxyflavone (**5**). The quaternary carbons of the A- and C-rings (\\(\\delta\\) 160.2, C-2; 176.6, C-4; 161.3, C-5; 164.4, C-7; 160.1, C-9; 109.7, C-10) were also assigned by comparison with those of **5** (\\(\\delta\\) 160.5, C-2; 177.5, C-4; 161.0, C-5; 164.1, C-7; 159.9, C-9; 109.3, C-10), whose assignments were aided by \\({}^{13}\\)C-\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY and long-range \\({}^{13}\\)C-\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY spectra (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997). The signal for C-3' was established as \\(\\delta\\) 148.9 by its comparison with the resonance for the corresponding carbon in **6**. The signal at \\(\\delta\\) 150.6 was then assigned to C-4'. The structure of flavone **8** was thus established as 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavone. Flavone **5** was previously obtained from _N. alba_ (Arruda et al., 1993) and _Murraya paniculata_ (Rutaceae) (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997).\n\n3',4'-Methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (**7**, age-conyllavone A) has been found previously in _Ageratum convzoides_ (Asteraceae) (Vyas et al., 1986). However, its \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data have not been reported previously in the literature. The chemical shifts of the A- and B-ring carbons were comparable with those for **6** and **8**, respectively (Table 3).\n\nAll phytochemical studies on _Neoraputia_ genus have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. However, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove _Neoraputia_ to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated flavones (Passador et al., 1997; Silva, et al., 1988). Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of _Neoraputia_ species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae.\n\nSome compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from _T. cruzi_ (Table 4). Chalcone **2** was separated from **4** and flavone **6** from **7** by R-HPLC; however, they were obtained in very small amount. Thus, only the initial inhibitory activity of these mixtures were evaluated. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 45% when the mixture of **2** and **4** was added to the assay system at a concentration of 105 mg/ml, suggesting that these chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The mixture of **6** and **7** completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 100%) at 100 mg/ml.\n\nThe activity of flavone **5** was comparable to that of the mixture of **6**-**7**, reducing the enzymatic activity by 99% at 100 mg/ml. The 50% inhibitory concentration value (IC50) was 81 mM.\n\nHighly oxygenated flavones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal \n\n## Page 7\n\nGAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. For this purpose co-crystal-lization experiments with flavone **5** have been undertaken, both in laboratory and under microgravity conditions, in the NASA Space Shuttle during mission STS-91, in May 1998. Unfortunately, we did not have any success with flavone **5**, and effective crystallization was observed only for a rutaceous coumarin. The related crystallographic studies are in progress and will be reported separately.\n\nTherefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavones and the enzyme GAPDH. Further crystallization experiments as well as solution studies by NMR spectral analysis are in progress.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nNMR: on a Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as int. standard, HSQC: Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (Ruiz-Cabello et al., 1992); PIEIMS: 70 eV, low resolution on a VG Platform II (Fisons) instrument; IR (KBr, BOMEN-Ft/IR); UV (Perkin-Elmer); R-HPLC: Recycling High-Performance Liquid Chromatography on a model Shimadzu LC-6AD; the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm x 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 A pore diameter; eluant: hexane-CH2Cl2-_iso_-ProH (15:5:1); flow rate: 3.0 ml/min; detection (Shimadzu SPD-6AV): UV \\(\\lambda\\) 254 nm; Elemental analysis: on a EA 1108, CHNS-O (Fisons).\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Neoraputia magnifica_ var. _magnifica_ was collected in Espirito Santo, Brazil, and a voucher specimen (SPF 81-316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas-USP-Sao Paulo.\n\n### Isolation of compounds\n\nGround fruits (825 g) were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. The conc. hexane extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient to give a mixture of fatty acids followed by 16 fractions. Fr 5 was rechromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2 gradient affording further frs. Fr 5-3 was rechromatographed as above, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (15:5:1) yielding **1** (12 mg).

Fr 3-2 was treated as above, eluting with a hexane-EtOAc gradient, to afford 3',4',5',5,7-pentamethoxyflavanone (5.0 mg), after crystallization from MeOH. Fr 4 was recrystallized from MeOH and then purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, benzene-CH2Cl2-Me2CO, 7:5:2) to give a mixt. of 6 and 7.

Further investigations afforded, in minor quantities, two new _C,O_-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picraminoside F (**1**), and an anthrone, mayoside C (**2**), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**3**) and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of compounds **1** and **2**, and the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe EtOAc extract from the bark of _P. taepensis_ afforded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds **1**-**4**, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shimadzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones **3** and **4** were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992).\n\nCompound **1** was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-molecular ions at \\(m/z\\) 671 ([M+1]\\({}^{+}\\)), 693 ([M+Na]\\({}^{+}\\)) and 709 ([M+K]\\({}^{+}\\)), with the base peak at \\(m/z\\) 509 ([M+1-C6H10O5]\\({}^{+}\\)). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic data.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nAll of the spectroscopic characteristics of **1** were coincident with those of anthrones which we have previously reported (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at _l_max 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)), ester carbonyl (1735 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) groups. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at \\(d\\) 7.4-7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of _meta_-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at \\(d\\) 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at \\(d\\) 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at \\(d\\) 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at \\(d\\) 3.40-3.95, indicating sugar moieties.\n\nThe presence of 33 carbons was evident from the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at \\(d\\) 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at \\(d\\) 95.8 and \\(d\\) 105.4. Signals in the region of \\(d\\) 62-81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D-E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agreement with lyxose (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on Solis et al. (1995) which identified the sugar of picramniosides A-C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-_O_ were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments confirmed only one CH\\({}_{2}\\) signal at \\(d\\) 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit.\n\nComplete assignment of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In particular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between the ester carbonyl (_d_ 164.7) and H-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\), H-2\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) and H-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\), indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-1\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) \\({}^{3}J\\) coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) (_d_ 81.4), confirming the position of the aglycone at C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a \\({}^{3}J\\) correlation of the anomeric\n\n## Page 3\n\nproton of the glucose unit (H-1, \\(d\\) 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the _O_-glucose unit at C-8.\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between H-5' and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. The configuration of the lysrose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (Solis et al., 1995; Hernandez-Medel et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-1' and H-2' (_J_ = 0 Hz) suggesting an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. Likewise, the \\(J\\) value of H-5'' (12 Hz) indicated an _ax_-_ax_ conformation for H-5'' and H-4'' in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety.\n\nFurther observations helped to establish the configuration at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of **1** (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picraminoside E (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the following expected differences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to _O_-glucosylation at C-8.\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of **2** gave pseudo-molecular ions at _m_/_z_ 709 ([M + Na]+) and 725 ([M + K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]-), which was consistent with the molecular formula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS-MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (_m_/_z_ 563), lysose (_m_/_z_ 432), CH2OH (_m_/_z_ 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corresponding to emodin (269).\n\nAs observed previously for the mayosides (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed the same pattern described for **1**, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of **2** had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). _O_-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound **2** at ring A.\n\nAsignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with published data (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not afford all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1'' with C-1 (_d_ 162) helped to confirm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1''.\n\nCircular dichroism confirmed the absolute configuration at C-10 of **1** and **2** as \\(S\\) and \\(R\\), respectively.

(1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds **3** and **4** presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in _Sesamm indicum_. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nMp: uncorr.; IR: BOMEM-FT-IR; UV: Hewlett Packard 8452A; 1H NMR, COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HSQC, HMBC and 13C NMR, in methanol-_d__a_, containing TMS as int. standard: Bruker DRX-400; ESIMS: Micromass Quattro LC, HRMS: Autospec-Micromass EBE.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe bark of _P. taepensis_ was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San Jose de la Montana, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica.\n\n### Isolation of constituents\n\nDried and powdered bark of _P. taepensis_ (615 g) was macerated with EtOH-H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then _n_-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID x 50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml min-1 UV detector at 254 nm), to afford compound **1** (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-_O_-b- **(3)** and 8-_O_-b-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). Further purification of **3** (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and **4** (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described). Fraction 11 was submitted to HPLC separation under the same conditions (6.5 ml min-1, 7 cycles) to afford pure compound **2** (1.2 mg, 0.0004% w/w).\n\n### Picraminoside F (1)\n\nYellow powder, m.p. 195degC (decomposition); HRMS: found 670.1894 [M]+, requires 670.1897; [a][5]5 (MeOH, \\(c\\) 3.7):-18.9; UV _l_max (MeOH) nm (e):340 (12920), 274 (12280), 228 (31020); IR (KBr) _n_max (cm-1): 3387, 2916, 2841, 1735, 1639, 1456, 1378, 1259, 1056, 753; 1H NMR (CD3OD, 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (CD3OD, 100 MHz) spectral data: Table 1; PI-ESIMS _m/z_ (rel. int.%): 709 (7) (M + K]+, 693 (30) [M + Na]+, 671 (12) [M + 1]+, 509 (100) [M + I-C6H1005]+; CD (MeOH, \\(c\\) 82.0 mM) \\(l\\) (_A_e_max): 348 (+ 0.8), 315 (-0.5), 269 (-2.3).\n\n### Mayoside C (2)\n\nYellow powder, m.p. 179degC (decomposition); HRMS: found 686.1851 [M]+, requires 686.1846; [a][5]5 (MeOH, \\(c\\) 4.0):-12.5; UV _l_max (MeOH) nm (e): 350 (12000), 276 (9990), 226 (29640); IR (KBr) _n_max (cm-1): 3452, 2935, 2839, 1726, 1635, 1485, 1270, 1043; 1H NMR (CD3OD, 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (CD3OD, 100 MHz) spectral data: Table 1; PI-ESIMS _m/z_ (rel. int.%): 725.6 (17) [M + K]+, 709.6 (100) [M + Na]+; NI-ESIMS-MS(rel. int.%): 685.3 (100) [M -H]-, 563.5 (10) [M-H-C6H5COOH]-, 432.1 (5), 401.2 (5), 269 (5), 121 (5) [C6H5COOH]-; CD (MeOH, ca 70.0 mM) \\(l\\) (D_e_max): 354 (+ 2.4), 312 (-1.9), 270 (-5.8).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Compounds & Minimum active concentration tested (μg ml−1) & Inhibition \\% \\\\ Sesamin & 70 & 80 \\\\ Mayoside B & 104 & 80 \\\\ Picraminoside E & 103 & 0 \\\\\n**3** & 20 & 70 \\\\\n**3** & 10 & 70 \\\\\n**4** & 28 & 70 \\\\\n4 & 14 & 70 \\\\ Umbelliferone & 130 & 70 \\\\ Umbelliferone & 70 & 20 \\\\ Umbelliferone & 40 & 0 \\\\ Emodin & 111 & 40 \\\\ Emodin & 70 & 20 \\\\ Emodin & 40 & 0 \\\\ Umbelliferone:emodin 1:1 & 87 & 20 \\\\ Umbelliferone:emodin 2:3 & 49 & 20 \\\\ Umbelliferone:emodin 1:5 & 76 & 0 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Growth inhibition activity of sesamin, mayoside B, picraminoside E, **3**, **4**, emodin and umbelliferone against _Leucoagaricus gongilophorus_\n\n## Page 5\n\n\n\n### Leucoagaricus gongilophorus growth inhibition assay\n\nThe assay was performed as described by Pagnocca et al.

Their seeds are valued in Brazil for their high yields of fatty acids, mainly myristic acid (C-14), which is extensively used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Other _Iryanthera_ species were reported to have their crushed leaves used by Amazon indians for healing seriously infected wounds and cuts and to have their latex from the banks mixed with warm water for treating stomache infections (Schultes and Holmstedt, 1971). In the course of our systematic studies on _Iryanthera_, we have demonstrated the presence of toctorienols with higher antioxidant activity than a-tocopherol in fruits of _I. grandis_ and _I. lancifolia_, evaluated through malondialdehyde (MDA) and chemiluminescence (CL) assays (Barros et al., 1993) and of antioxidant dihydrochalcones and flavonolignans in _I. lancifolia_ (Silva et al., 1999). Studies on toctorienol biological activities revealed the ability of a- and -tocotrienol in inhibiting solid tumour growth of sarcoma 180 and also the highly metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma cells (Komiyama et al., 1992). Moreover, these toctorienols are effective against vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, which plays a central role in atherosclerosis (Azzi et al., 1992). Oxidative damage to cell components is the initial event in several human disease processes including cancer and atherosclerosis (Gordon, 1996), and this has intensified the search for natural antioxidants. The antioxidant activity of a compound depends ultimately on its ease of oxidation and, for a variety of natural or synthetic compounds, good correlations have been observed between antioxidant activities and low oxidation potentials (Born et al., 1996). In this work we report on the isolation of antioxidant compounds of _I. juruensis_ fruits guided by the b-carotene TLC assay (Pratt and Miller, 1984) and the evaluation of their oxidation potentials through cyclic voltammetry. Further examination of the lipophyllic constituents led to isolation of inactive compounds, which were also investigated electrochemically.\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nDried and powdered fruits were extracted with hexane. Fractionation of the crude extract guided by the antioxidant TLC assay afforded **1**, **2** and **6**-**9**. In addition, inactive metabolites **3**, **4** and **5a**-**e** were isolated (see Experimental).\n\nThe structural determination of compounds **1** and **2** was based on analysis of their NMR and MS spectra as well as on comparison with literature data for similar\n\n## Page 2\n\ncompounds (Vieira et al., 1983a). The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra of compounds **1** and **2** showed two doublets at \\(d\\) _d_ \\(d\\) _d_ \\(d\\) _d_ = 9.7\\(\\pm\\)0.1 Hz) and \\(d\\) _d_ 6.17\\(\\pm\\)0.02 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 9.7\\(\\pm\\)0.1 Hz) assigned to H-3 and H-4, respectively, typical of the chromene ring of C-3 unsaturated toctortienols, which had only been found previously in brown seaweeds from genera _Sargassum_ and _Stypopodium_ (Kusumi et al., 1979; Gerwick and Fenical, 1981). The other spectral features are similar to those of C-3 saturated toctortienols; therefore, \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data could be assigned by comparison with _d_-tocotrienol and 17-carboxy-d-cotortienol, previously isolated from pericarps of _I. lancifolia_ and fruits of _I. grands_ (Vieira et al., 1983b; Lopes et al., 1998). Tocotrienol **2** was identified as sargaschromenol, originally isolated from _Sargassum seratifolium_ (Kusumi et al., 1979). The new toctorienol **1** differs from **2** by one additional methyl group on the chromene ring (C-7); its only aromatic proton was placed at C-5 after observation of NOE interactions between H-5 and H-4. Further NOE observations, COSY and DEPT as well as ESMS data led to elucidation of **1** as 2,7,8-tri-methyl-2-[(_3E,7Z_)-4,12-dimethyl-8-carboxyl-3,7,11-tri-decatrienyl]-3-chromen-6-ol for which we propose the name 7-methyl-sargachromenol.\n\nThe \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of **3** and **4** showed two signals at \\(d\\) 187.7 \\(\\pm\\) 0.2 and \\(d\\) 187.9 \\(\\pm\\) 0.1 for two ketone groups conjugated to sp\\({}^{2}\\) carbons, which were assigned, respectively, to C-1 and C-4 of the quinone ring. DEPT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\) experiments indicated the presence of six methyl groups in compound **3** and five methyl groups in **4**. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra of **3** and **4** showed one doublet at \\(d\\) 3.05 (_J_ = 7.1 Hz) integrating for two hydrogens on a sp\\({}^{3}\\)carbon linked to two sp\\({}^{2}\\) carbons. The \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum showed the correlation of this signal with the multiplet centered at \\(d\\) 5 and the signal at \\(d\\) 6.39, assigned to H-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and H-3, respectively, and confirms the placement of the only quinone ring hydrogen of compound **3** on C-3. The additional methyl group of compound **3** was then placed at C-5. The remaining spectral data were consistent with the proposed structures, including the placement of a carboxyl group on the isoprenic chain, determined through MS data (Fig. 1). The structure of this new quinone, named as 3-methyl-sargaquinoic acid, was established as 2,3-dimethyl-6-[(_2E,6E,10Z_)-3,7,15-trimethyl-11-carboxyl-2,6,10,14-hexadecatetraenyl]-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione. Compound **4**, which was identified as sargaquinoic acid after comparison of its NMR spectrum and MS profile with literature data, was originally isolated from the brown algae _Sargassum seratifolium_ (Kusumi et al., 1979) and differs from **3** only concerning the quinone ring substitution pattern. The new compounds **1** and **3** follow the \\(\\gamma\\)-tocotrienol pattern, while the known **2** and **4** follow the \\(\\delta\\)-tocotrienol substitution pattern.\n\nCompounds **5a**-**c** were identified as o-aryalkanoic acids based on a broad singlet at \\(d\\) 1.18 of a methylene chain and the absence of a terminal methyl group, (ca. \\(d\\) 0.8, _t_) in the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum, associated to the signal at \\(d\\) 179.4 on the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum and the presence of an aromatic ring. The substitution pattern of this ring, linked to the methylene chain, was defined through observation of two doublets at \\(d\\) 6.61 (_J_ = 1.6 Hz) and \\(d\\) 6.66 (_J_ = 7.7 Hz) and one doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 6.55 (_J_ = 1.6 and 7.7 Hz) in the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum. The presence of a methylenedioxy group was inferred through observation of signals at \\(d\\) 5.85 and \\(d\\) 100.6 in the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra, respectively. The LC-UV-MS analysis of the mixture of **5a**-**c** evidenced the presence of three substances (_R_T 15.0, 16.1 and 17.1 min.), which absorbed at _l_max 284 nm. The ESMS analysis indicated a molecular weight of 362, 390 and 418 for compounds **5a**-**c**, inferred from base peaks at _m_/_z_ 385, 413 and 441 ([M + Na]\\({}^{+}\\)), respectively. The on-line analysis showed additional peaks at 363, 391 and 419 ([M + 1]\\({}^{+}\\)) which confirmed the length of the methylene chains of these compounds. The o-aryalkanoic acids **5a**-**c** result biogenetically from condensation of substituted dihydrocinnamic acid and lauric, myristic and palmitic acids, respectively. As these o-aryalkanoic acids proved to be new natural products, their isolation was subsequently undertaken. Their EIMS spectra showed base \n\n## Page 3\n\npeaks at \\(m/z\\) 135 [C7H5.CH2O2]\\({}^{+}\\), which confirmed the proposed structures for these compounds. These o-ary-alkanoic acids had not been isolated from natural sources yet and are probably the biosynthetic precursors of juruenolides, o-aryalkanoic acids condensed with pyruvic acid followed by \\(\\gamma\\)-lactonization, found in the trunk wood of _Iryanthera juruensis_ (Vieira et al., 1983b) and pericarps of _Virola surinamensis_ (Lopes et al., 1998).\n\nLignans **6**-**9** were identified as _epi_-guaiacin, guaiacin, verrucosin and nectandrin B, respectively, from their spectroscopic data and comparison with literature (Majunder et al., 1972; Gottlieb et al., 1976; Joshi et al., 1979; Moro et al., 1987; Ward, 1997).\n\nAntioxidative properties of compounds **1**-**9** were evaluated against b-carotene (Pratt and Miller, 1984). By using b-carotene as a TLC spray reagent, tocotrienols **1** and **2** and lignans **6**-**9** (10 mg) appeared as yellow spots against a white background, meaning these compounds inhibited the bleaching of b-carotene. The same amounts of quinones **3** and **4** and o-aryalkanoic acids **5a**-**c** were completely inactive.\n\nThe evaluation of the redox properties of tocotrienols **1** and **2** was carried out electrochemically in order to compare their voltammetric behaviour and to correlate the corresponding oxidation potentials with antioxidant properties of these compounds (Born et al., 1996). Firstly, the electrochemical behaviour was investigated with a-tocopherol being used as reference compound. In addition, taking into consideration that oxidation products of tocopherols and tocotrienols can be electrochemically reduced, the reduction of the oxidized products of tocotrienols **1** and **2**, previously generated on the electrode surface after oxidation step were also studied and compared to the voltammetric behaviour of plastoquinolones **3** and **4**. The cyclic voltammograms of a-tocopherol and tocotrienols **1** and **2** showed oxidation peaks at \\(+\\,0.28,\\;+\\,0.23\\) and \\(+\\,0.32\\) V (Table 1) respectively, suggesting a higher antioxidant capacity for tocotrienol **1**, when compared to a-tocopherol. The comparison among oxidation potentials of tocotrienols **1** and **2** and a-tocopherol shows that **1** is the most easily oxidizable compound. Alkyl groups _meta_ to the aromatic hydroxyl have little effect on the oxidation ability of phenolic compounds, but inductive effects from either _ortho_ or _para_ alkyl groups may lower the oxidation potential and make the molecule even easier oxidized than the phenol itself (Marcus and Hawley, 1970). This could explain the lower oxidation potential of **1** when compared to **2**, as they possess the aromatic substitution pattern of g- and d-tocotrienol, respectively. The lower oxidation potential of **1** when compared to a-tocopherol might be due to its C-3 double bond, which is conjugated with the aromatic ring and stabilizes the intermediate cation previous to completion of oxidation steps.\n\nThe structure-activity relationship indicates, in this case, that the stabilizing effect of the C-3 double bond on the intermediate cation due to the presence of one aromatic methyl group _ortho_ to the hydroxyl (e.g. compound\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} Substance & EPould. (V) & EPrd. (V) \\\\ α-Tocoferola & \\(+\\,0.28\\) & \\(-\\,0.90\\)a \\\\\n**1a** & \\(+\\,0.23\\) & \\(-\\,0.43\\)a; \\(-\\,1.00\\)a \\\\\n**2a** & \\(+\\,0.32\\) & \\(-\\,0.38\\)a; \\(-\\,0.93\\)a \\\\\n**3** & \\(-\\) & \\(-\\,0.50\\); \\(-\\,0.90\\) \\\\\n**4** & \\(-\\) & \\(-\\,0.38\\); \\(-\\,0.8\n\n## Page 4\n\n1) overcomes, although slightly, the stabilizing effect of two aromatic methyl groups _ortho_ to the hydroxyl, if the C-3 double bond is absent (e.g. _a_-tocopherol). The contribution of this double bond is, however, not enough to keep up the intermediate cation stability if no methyl group _ortho_ to the hydroxyl group is present in the molecule, as in compound **2**. The electrochemical behaviour of quinones **3** and **4** was compared to those of the oxidized products of tocotrienols **1** and **2**, respectively. The great similarity observed for the reduction potentials of these oxidation products and tocotrienols **1** and **2** suggests that the products generated after oxidation of tocotrienols **1** and **2** are structurally closely related to quinones **3** and **4**, respectively.\n\nThe high oxidation potential of the o-aryalkanoic acids **5a**-**c** is probably a result of the lack of aromatic hydroxyl groups in these molecules. The absence of oxidation peak in the cyclic voltammograms of **3** and **4** as well as the high value (+1.52) for **5a**-**c** are in agreement with the inactivity observed on the b-carotene assay for these compounds.\n\nThe cyclic voltammograms of lignans **6**-**9** showed oxidation potentials in the range 0.8-0.9 V, suggesting that they should act as rather less effective antioxidants than tocotrienols **1** and **2**. The structure-activity correlations of these results can not be promptly inferred, as electron donor groups _ortho_ to a hydroxyl should enhance the stabilization capacity of the molecule after hydrogen radical loss (Rice-Evans et al., 1996). The lower oxidation potential of tocotrienols might nonetheless be explained by the stabilization of the molecule conferred by the C-3 double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring, which might enhance the ease of oxidation of tocotrienols more efficiently than the methoxyl group _ortho_ to the hydroxyl group in lignans **6**-**9**. Nevertheless, the qualitative analyses of the anti-oxidative properties of tocotrienols **1**, **2** and lignans **6**-**9** through the b-carotene assay showed all these compounds were active, as previously referred.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nThe UV and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B and a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1750 spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR spectra (1H, 13C, COSY and NOE experiments) were measured on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer (300 MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 13C) in CDCl3 for all compounds; the chemical shifts are reported in ppm with TMS as internal standard, and coupling constants (_J_) are given in Hz. EIMS spectra were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5988-A. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer 2400.\n\n### Plant material\n\nFruits were collected in Reserva do Mocambo, in the Amazon Forest, in the rainy season and identified as _Iryanthera juruensis_ Warburg by Botanist Nelson Rosa. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium Joao Murca Pires at Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe dried fruits were grounded and extracted with hexane. The extract was dried under reduced pressure and partitioned between hexane and 90% methanol. The hydroalcoholic fraction (7.6 g) was submitted to vacuum column chromatography over silica gel, which was eluted with hexane/EtOAc mixtures of increasing polarity to yielded 8 fractions (A-H). Flash column chromatography over silica gel of fraction B eluted with gradient of hexane/EtOAc afforded **2** (31 mg), **4** (53 mg) and other 13 pooled fractions. Purification of fractions B-5 and B-11 through prep. TLC (hexane/EtOAc 8:2) gave **3** (15 mg) and **1** (12 mg), respectively. Purification of fraction B-8 through prep. TLC (hexane/EtOAc 8:2) gave the mixture of the o-aryalkanoic acids **5a**-**c**, which was further purified by HPLC (RP-18, MeOH/H2O 85:15) to afford **5a** (5 mg) and **5c** (6 mg). Compound **5b** was not isolated as the HPLC analysis indicated it was a minor compound (~5% of the mixture of **5a**-**c**). Flash column chromatography over silica gel of fraction E eluted with a gradient of hexane/EtOAc gave 6 pooled fractions (A-F'). Purification of fraction C' through prep. TLC (hexane/EtOAc 1:1) and HPLC (RP-18, MeOH/H2O 86:14) gave **6** (8 mg). Partial dissolution of fraction D' in CHCl3 gave a precipitate which was further washed with MeOH to give **7** (60 mg). Purification of fraction E' through prep. TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 95:5) and HPLC (RP-18, MeOH/H2O 78:22) gave **8** (6 mg) and **9** (4 mg).\n\n### \\(\\text{Lc}/\\text{UV}/\\text{MS}\\)\n\nThe separation of compounds **5a**-**c** was achieved by using MeOH:H2O in the isocratic mode (85:15, 1 ml/ min.). UV spectra were recorded from 200 to 400 nm. For MS, the temperature of the electrospray (ES) source block was set to 75degC. The cone voltage was 70 V and ionization was achieved in the positive mode at an ionization voltage of 4.5 kV. Nitrogen was used as a nebulizing and curtain gas. Nebulizer gas was set to 0.5 l/min, curtain gas to 5.0 l/min. Full-scan spectra from _m/z_ 150 to 550 were recorded every 1.2 s.\n\n### 2,7,8-Trimethyl-2-[(3E,7Z)-4,12-dimethyl-8-carb-oxyl-3,7,11-tridecatrienyl]-3-chromen-6-ol (**1**)\n\nBrown oil.

The yellow spots remaining indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.\n\n### Electrochemical assay\n\nThe cyclic voltammograms were carried out with a Polarecord E-506 (Metrohm) potentiostat. A three electrode system (663 VA, Metrohm) with a working electrode of glassy carbon (GC), a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a carbon auxiliary electrode was used. Dichoromethane (Merck) was used as solvent and tetra-_n_-butyl ammonium tetrafluorborate (Merck), as the supporting electrolyte. Vitamin E (Aldrich) was used as reference compound. The working electrode was polished with aluminium oxide 0.3 um (Buehler) and special polishing cloth (Buehler) prior to each measurement, because formation of a polymeric film inactivated the electrode after each scan. The electrode was then washed thoroughly with water, dried and cycled several times in the range \\(-1.6\\) to \\(+\\,0.6\\) V in order to reassure the absence of voltammetric signal due to the supporting electrolyte. Each compound was dissolved to concentrations of 10-20 mM in dichloromethane and added to a 15 ml aliquot of the supporting electrolyte. The solns. were then deoxygenated with nitrogen for 10 min. and the cyclic voltammograms were carried out at scan rate of 50 mV/s.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank to FAPESP, FUNDUNESP, CNPq and CAPES for financial support.\n\n## References\n\n* [Azzi et al.1992] Azzi, A., Boscoboinik, D.O., Chatelain, E., 1992.

All rights reserved.\n\n_Petiveria alliacea_; Phytolacaceae; Antifungal polysulphides\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n_Petiveria alliacea_ L. (Phytolacaceae) is a shrub widely distributed in South and Central America. It grows in all regions of Brazil where it is known by many popular names. Among these, \"erva-guine\", \"guine\", \"pipi\" and \"tipi\"; and the Tupi-Guarani \"macuracaa\" are noteworthy (Hoehne, 1939; Pio Correa, 1969). In the State of Minas Gerais the roots of this plant are used to treat rheumatism (De Sousa et al., 1987) and in other Brazilian regions, both the roots and the leaves are popularly used as stimulants and abortefacients (Da Silva, 1935). Previous work on _P. alliacea_ revealed the occurrence of coumarins, triterpenes and flavonoids (Rocha and Da Silva, 1969; Delle Monache and Suarez, 1992), amino acids and trisulphide (Adegosan, 1974). In continuing our search for biologically active compounds from the Brazilian flora (Carbonezi et al., 1999), a CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)/MeOH (2:1 v/v) extract of the roots of this plant was selected for phytochemical investigation due to its significant activity against some mutant yeast strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (Gunatilaka et al., 1994) and inhibition of the growth of _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphareospermum_ (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). This study led to the isolation of five new polysulphides (**2**, **3**, **5**, **6** and **7**), together with two known compounds (**1**, **4**). Among the known compounds described in this study, only compound **4** had been previously isolated from this plant species (De Sousa et al., 1990).\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)/MeOH (2:1) extract of roots of _P. alliacea_ L. inhibited strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (RS 188N, RS 52YK and RS 321) indicating strong activity of this extract towards the mutant strains of yeast. This extract was also shown to possess potent inhibitory activity against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _Cladosporium sphaerosporum_ fungi. Solvent-solvent partitioning of the bioactive crude extract afforded hexane, CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) and EtOAc fractions, in which the activities were concentrated. These fractions were individually subjected to silica gel column chromatography, using CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) or CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)/MeOH as eluents, to obtain six major bioactive fractions. The purification of these fractions was performed on silica gel preparative TLC, reversed-phase Sep Pak cartridge and HPLC affording seven bioactive polysulphide compounds.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nThe molecular formula of compound **1** was determined as C6H14S2, by 1H, 13C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Three resonances at \\(d\\) 2.66 \\(t\\) (_J_ = 7.25 Hz), \\(d\\) 1.72 _dq_ (_J_ = 7.5, 6.5) and 0.99 \\(t\\) (_J_ = 7.26 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum were characteristic of a propyl moiety (Table 1). The 13C NMR data also supported the propyl skeleton (Table 2). The proton resonance at \\(d\\) 2.66, corresponding to a methylene group, was attributed to a sulfur-bearing carbon atom, which was confirmed by elemental analysis and interpretation of its mass spectrum. According to these data the structure of **1** was assigned as dippropyl disulphide, which is reported as a natural derivative in Phytolacaceae for the first time.\n\nCompounds **2**-**5** exhibited common features in their MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The presence of a significant ion peak at _m_/_z_ 91, which is characteristic of a benzyl fragment was observed in all mass spectra of these compounds. The benzyl portion appeared to bear one, two, three and four sulfur atoms, respectively, based on the elemental analyses. The 1H NMR spectra (Table 1) of **2**, **3**, **4** and **5** presented the same signal, around \\(d\\) 7.30, compatible with a monosubstituted aromatic ring. The major differences observed in the 1H NMR spectra of each compound was due to the chemical shift of the methylene benzylic hydrogens linked to the sulfur, which in compound **2** appeared at \\(d\\) 3.66; **3** at \\(d\\) 4.05; **4** at \\(d\\) 4.15 (De Souza et al., 1990) and **5** at \\(d\\) 4.19, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) of these compounds, interpreted with the aid of DEPT spectra, indicated the presence of one quaternary C and five CH's sp2 carbons attributable to an aromatic monosubstituted ring and one sp3 CH2 assigned to a benzylic carbon. The elemental analysis and HRMS data of compounds **2**-**5** firmly established the number (and amount) of sulfur atoms in these polysulphides and confirmed their identities as dibenzyl sulphide (**2**), dibenzyl disulphide (**3**), dibenzyl trisulphide (**4**) and dibenzyl tetrasulphide (**5**), respectively. Polysulphide **4** has previously been reported from this species (De Souza et al., 1990).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**6** had an hydroxymethyl group linked to the sulfur in place of the second benzylic group as in compound **2**. Interpretation of some HMBC data (Fig. 1) aided elucidation of this structure. Correlations observed between the methylene protons signal at \\(d\\) 5.03 with the benzylic carbon at \\(d\\) 44.27 and the methylene protons signal at \\(d\\) 3.60 with the carbons at \\(d\\) 78.50 and 127.42 established compound **6** as benzylhydroxymethyl monosulphide.\n\nPolysulphide **7** is closely comparable with dibenzyl trinsulphide **(4)**; comparison of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) data with those of **4** showed that the only differences observed were due to chemical shift of the benzylic hydrogens, which in **7** appeared at \\(d\\) 4.20 (_d_C = 43.19) and the presence of an additional singlet signal at \\(d\\) 5.30, which was attributed to methylene protons by the analysis inferred by COSY, HMQC and DEPT spectral data. Analysis of \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopic data recorded a methylene benzylic carbon at \\(d\\) 43.19 and a second one, extremely unshielded at \\(d\\) 106.32, whose chemical shift could be explained by the stereo-eletronic effects of several sulfur atoms linked to methylene carbon. In fact, no correlations were observed in the spectra of the \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H COSY and HMBC (Fig. 1) of the corresponding methylene protons with other protons or carbons, respectively in **7**. The elemental analysis, together with HRMS analysis established its molecular formula as C\\({}_{15}\\)H\\({}_{16}\\)S\\({}_{6}\\) and thus confirmed **7** to be di(benzyltrithio) methane.\n\nBioautography with the plant pathogenic fungi _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ was employed to guide fractionation and isolation of the polysulphides **1**-**7**, these being responsible for the fungicidal activity detected in the crude extract (Table 3). Similar or higher to the reference compound Nystatin, the polysulphides **1**-**4** showed potent inhibition, while compounds **5**-**7** showed marginal activity against fungal growth (10.0 > 25 and 5.0 mg, respectively), in both phytopathogenic strains tested. Furthermore, their potential anticancer activities were also tested, using a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka et al., 1994). Compounds **1**, **3** and **5** had moderate effect on DNA, as deduced by the selective inhibition of the mutant strains RS 321 and RS 52YK, relative to the wild strain RS 188N (Table 3).\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation\n\n\\({}^{1}\\)H NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer, using TMS as an int. standard. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR (50 or 75 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 and DPX-300 spectrometer. EI-MS were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/5988 A spectrometer and on a VG platform II spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer 2400. IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR 1750 Perkin Elmer and FT-IR 510 Nicolet. UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV/vis Hitachi U-3000.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe species _Petiveria alliacea_ L. was collected in September and October (1997) in the Instituto Butanta Reserve, in the city of Sao Paulo. Whole shrubs were collected and separated in their distinct parts: leaves, stems and roots. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botanica-SMA, under the number SP112.6.84.\n\n### Biological testing\n\nDNA-damaging assay with mutant yeast _S. cerevisiae_: Experimental screening methods utilizing mutant strains of _S. cerevisiae_ have been described elsewhere (Gunatilaka et al., 1992).

Ten microliters of the solutions of crude extracts, fractions and pure compounds were prepared, in different concentrations: corresponding to 20, 10, 1, 0.1 \\(\\mu\\)g for pure compounds and 100, 50, 30 and 20 \\(\\mu\\)g for the crude extracts or fractions, respectively. The samples were applied to TLC plates, these being eluted with the appropriate solvent system followed by complete removal of the solvent. The chromatographic plates were sprayed with spores suspension of _C. sphaerosospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ in a nutritive medium and incubated for 48 h at 37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. After incubation, clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background chromatogram.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nRoots, stems, and leaves of _P. allacea_ L. were dried at room temperature, powdered and extracted three times with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1, v/v), for two days, at room temperature. The resulting extracts were filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield 7.0, 8.0 and 15 g of root, stem and leaf extracts, respectively. Due to the higher bioactivity noted, half of the root extract was suspended in MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and _n_-butanol. After liquid/liquid partition, the resulting residue was concentrated in vacuo and extracted with H\\({}_{2}\\)O. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the hexane, CHCl\\({}_{3}\\), and EtoOAc solubles, using silica gel column chromatography and hexane, CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\), CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc and CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (with increasing polarity) as eluants, afforded several fractions, whose bioactivities were detected only in six of them. The first hexane fraction was applied to a Si gel column tilting with a hexane:CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) gradient to afford compound **1** (22 mg). The fractions eluted with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc were further subjected to silica gel column chromatography using a MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O gradient. The intermediary fractions of this column, purified by HPLC using a C-18 Econosil column, 5 mm, 250\\(\\times\\)4 mm i.d., with an elution gradient of MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (70:30) 7 min; MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (90:10) 15 min. and MeOH (100%) 20 min with flow rate of 1 ml/min yielded the compounds **2** (7.8 mg), **3** (4.5 mg), **4** (15.0 mg) and **5** (3.6 mg). The EtOAc soluble fraction, was subjected to Si gel column chromatography using CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc with increasing polarity. The fractions obtained with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc (7:3) afforded **6** (3.8 mg). Compound **7** (2.0 mg) was isolated from the hexane fraction, by further purification over column chromatography on Si gel eluted with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):EtOAc (8:2).\n\n#### 3.4.1 Dipropyl disulphide (1)\n\nColorless volatile oil with a strong odour of garlic.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of _Piper arboreum_ yielded two new amides, _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**1**), arboreumine (**2**) together with the known compounds _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_)-pentaenosyl]-pyrrolidine (**3**) and _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_), 9(_E_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**4**). Catalytic hydrogenation of **3** yielded the amide _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]-pyrrolidine (**5**). We also have isolated six amides (**6-11**) and two antifungal cinnamoxyl derivatives (**12, **13**) from seeds and leaves of _Piper tuberculatum_.

These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides _N_-[7-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(_Z_),4(_Z_)-heptadienoyl]pyrrolidine, (32,_S_Z_)-_N_-isobutyl-8-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of _Piper hspidium_ H. B. K. (Alecio et al., 1998) and 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13,14-trimethoxyscinnamoyl)-\\(\\Delta^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one from _Piper tuberculatum_ Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**1**), arboreumine (**2**) and nine **(3-11)** known antifungal amides _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_)-pentaenosyl]-pyrrolidinine (**3**), its derivative _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]-pyrrolidine (**5**) and _N_-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_E_)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (**4**); besides pedilirine (**6**), \\(\\Delta^{\\text{a}\\text{b}}\\)-dihydropierine (**7**), piperidine (**8**), dihydropierine (**9**), _cis_-pieridine (or 8(_Z_)-_N_-(12,13, 14-trimethoxyscinnamoyl)-\\(\\Delta^{3}\\)-pyridin-2-one) (**10**) and fagaramide (**11**). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxyscinnamate (**12**) and methyl _trans_-6,7,8-trimethoxyscinnamate (**13**). The amides isolated from leaves of _Piper arboreum_ (**1**-**4**) and the hydrogenated derivative of **3 (**5**)** were active against the fungus _Cladosporium phaerosospermum_, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of _Piper tuberculatum_ **3, 4** and 6**-**13**\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n(Navickiene et al., 2000) were also active against the fungi _Cladosporium sphaerospermann_ and _C. cladosporioides_, as evaluated by direct bioautography (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n_N_-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(_E_),9(_Z_)-pentadienoil]-pyrrolidine (**1**) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm-1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at \\(d\\) 5.93 (2H, _s_), and four olefinic protons which showed signals at \\(d\\) 6.29 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)7,8 = 14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)8,7 = 14.3 and \\(J\\)8,9 = 10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\)9,8 = 10.9 and \\(J\\)9,10 = 11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\)10,9 = 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the \\(E\\) and \\(Z\\) geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the \\(E\\) and \\(Z\\) configurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of _trans-trans_ configuration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assignment of the _cis_ configuration for the g,d double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at \\(d\\) 3.52 (2H, _m_) and \\(d\\) 1.90 (2H, m) attributed to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of **1** were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-field region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at \\(d\\) 164.8, 10 sp2 carbons, four sp3 carbons [_d_C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at \\(d\\) 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Araujo-Junior et al., 1997; Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000).\n\nArboreumine (**2**) was shown to have the molecular formula C23H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES-MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm-1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respectively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at \\(d\\) 2.15 (2H, \\(J\\)2a,2b - _?a,2b = 17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, \\(J\\)2b,2a -?b,2a = 17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H-2'a and H-2b, H-2'b which are characteristic of methylene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-9', at \\(d\\) 4.29 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\)10,9 - _?,8' = 5.0 Hz and \\(J\\)10,11 - _?,10' = 6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at \\(d\\) 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at \\(d\\) 1.20 (_J_11,10 - _?,9' = 6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-11'; H-13, H-12'; H-14, H-13' and H-11, H-10', respectively. The signal at \\(d\\) 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as confirmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-5'; H-8, H-7' and H-9, H-8' showed signals at \\(d\\) 5.81 (_q_, \\(J\\)6,12 - _?,11' = 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (_dd_, \\(J\\)8,9 -?,8' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)8,12 - _?,11' = 1.0 Hz) and 5.76 (_dd_, \\(J\\)9,8 -?,7' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)9,10 - _?,9' = 5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further confirmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spectrum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-7'; H-9, H-8' and H-10, H-9' was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.76 assigned to H-9, H-8' (_J_9,8 -?,7 = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)9,10 - _?,9' = 5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at \\(d\\) 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-7' (_J_8,9 -?,8' = 15.5 Hz and \\(J\\)8,12 -?,11' = 1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at \\(d\\) 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-9' (_J_10,9 -?,8' = 5.0 Hz and \\(J\\)10,11 -?,10' = 6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at \\(d\\) 1.20 assigned to H-11, H-10' (_J_11,10 -?,9' = 6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at \\(d\\) 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-2'a (_J_2a,2b -?a,2b = 17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at \\(d\\) 2.37 assigned to H-2b, H-2'b (_J_2b,2a -?b,2a = 17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spectral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum. The carbon signals at \\(d\\) 49.5 and 40.9\n\n## Page 4\n\nassigned to C-2, C-2' and C-3, C-3', respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at \\(\\delta\\) 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the carbon (C-3 and C-3'), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at \\(\\delta\\) 198.3 and the 3H singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 0.95 (C-14 and C-13') indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3' was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-2'a and H-2b, H-2'b (\\(\\delta\\) 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3' (\\(\\delta\\) 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-12' and C-14, C-13' and H-14, H-13' and C-13, C-12' were also observed. The carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 163.9 (C-5, C-4'), 126.1 (C-6, C-5') and 40.9 (C-3, C-3') showed a correlation with the 1H singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at \\(\\delta\\) 2.15 (H-2a, H-2'a), corroborating the adjacent relationship between the amide group and C-2, C-2'. The carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 67.3 (C-10, C-9') and 135.6 (C-9, C-8') showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-10' adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,t-unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambiguously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at \\(\\delta\\) 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 11' with the carbon signals \\(\\delta\\) 126.1 (C-6, C-5') and 128.6 (C-8, C-7'), whereas the quadruplet at \\(\\delta\\) 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-5' (\\(J_{6,12-5,11'}\\)= 1.0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at \\(\\delta\\) 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-7'). Finally, HETCOR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide **2** was determined as depicted.\n\nThe CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of _P. tuberculatum_ were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\) containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to afford compounds **6-13**. Pellitorine (**6**) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further purification, and it was identified by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data previously described by Rosario et al., 1996. d\\({}^{\\Delta,\\mathrm{b}}\\)dihydro piperine (**7**) and dihydropiplartine (**9**) had their \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra published for the same compounds previously isolated from _ Piper rugosum_ (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and _ Piper guineense_ (Parmar et al., 1997) and their \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (**8**) was isolated from seeds and leaves, and the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). _Cis_-piplartine (**10**) had its \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (**11**) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl _trans_-6,7,8-tri-methoxycinnamate (**13**) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectroscopic data were similar to that obtained in this work.\n\nThe antifungal activity of compounds **1-13** was determined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds **1-13** (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for _C. sphaerospermum_ and _C. cladosporioides_ growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered.\n\nThe minimum amount of compounds **3-4**; **2** and **5**; and **1** required to inhibit growth of the fungus _C. sphaerospermum_ on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds **3** and **4** showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the standards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against _C. cladosporioides_, the amide **4** being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds **6-10**, **13** and **11**, **12** the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus _C. cladosporioides_ on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for **6-10** and **13** indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from _P. arboreum_ are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l r} \\hline Position & **2** & \\\\ \\hline  & \\({}^{1}\\)H \\(\\delta\\) [\\(m\\), \\(J\\) (Hz), 500 MHz] & \\({}^{13}\\)C \\(\\delta\\)a  \\\\  & & (125 MHz) \\\\ \\hline\n1, 1′ & 2.80 (1H, \\(s\\)) & – \\\\\n2a, 2′a & 2.15 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{2a,2b,2b-2a,2b}\\)= 17.0) & 49.5 (_t_) \\\\\n2b, 2b & 2.37 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J_{2a,2b,2a-2b,2a}\\)= 17.0) & \\\\\n3, 3′ & – & 40.9 (_s_) \\\\\n4 & – & 198.3 (_s_) \\\\\n5, 4′ & – & 163.9 (_s_) \\\\\n6, 5′ & 5.81 (1H, \\(q\\), \\(J_{6,12-5,11'}\\)= 1.0) & 126.1 (_d_) \\\\\n7, 6′ & – & b \\\\\n8, 7′ & 5.70 (1H, \\(dd\\), \\(J_{8,9\n\n## Page 5\n\npiperidine, dihydropyridone and isobutyl amides from _P. tuberculatum_. It is important to note that the inhibition of _C. sphaerospermann_ by dihydropyridone amide **9** appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of _C. cladosporioides_ was lower than the standards (Table 4).\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2x250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), flow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were performed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Piper arboreum_ H. B. K. leaves were collected in Aranaquara--SP, Brazil and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias--USP, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil.\n\n_Piper tuberculatum_ Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA--Manaus, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biociencias--USP, Sao Paulo--SP, Brazil.\n\n### Antifungal assays\n\nThe microorganisms used in the antifungal assays _C. sphaerospermann_ (Penzig) SPC 491 and _C. cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay--10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds **1-5** and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds **6-13**, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of _C. sphaerospermann_ or _C. cladosporioides_ in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 degC. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of **1-5** and **6-13** required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and microazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nA CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of _P. arboreum_ was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides **1-4**.\n\nThe dried and powdered leaves of _P. arboreum_ (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and conc. in vacuo to afford 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively. The resulting CH2Cl2 soluble\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compound & Antifungal activity a (μg) \\\\\n**3** & 0.1 \\\\\n**4** & 0.1 \\\\\n**6** & 5.0 \\\\\n**7** & 5.0 \\\\\n**8** & 5.0 \\\\\n**9** & 5.0 \\\\\n**10** & 5.0 \\\\\n**11** & 10.0 \\\\\n**12** & 10.0 \\\\\n**13** & 5.0 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Antifungal activity of compounds **6–13** against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compound & Antifungal activity a (μg) \\\\\n**1** & 10.0 \\\\\n**2** & 5.0 \\\\\n**3** & 0.1 \\\\\n**4** & 0.1 \\\\\n**5** & 5.0 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Antifungal activity of amides **1–5** against _Cladosporium sphaerospermann_\n\n## Page 6\n\npart (54.8 g) were applied to a silica gel column (300.0 g), and eluted with CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) containing increasing amounts of MeOH (up to 100%) to give 30 fractions. Fraction 19 (1.7 g) was applied to a C\\({}_{18}\\) HPLC column (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O (4:1). After that the fractions were purified by prep. TLC [CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\): (CH\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)CO (92:02) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding **1** (28.0 mg) and **3** (31.0 mg).

TLC [CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\): (CH\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)CO (6:3:1) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding **3** (83.0 mg) and **4** (30.0 mg).\n\nThe dried and powdered seeds and leaves of _P. tuberculatum_ (24.3 g) were extracted 2\\(\\times\\) with 600 ml of CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\):MeOH (2:1), during 2 days (each extraction), at room temperature. The resulting extract of seeds was filtered and conc. in vacuo to afford 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield **8** (33.0 mg) and **10** (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yielded **9** (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds **6** (0.2 g) and **7** (18.0 mg), respectively, without any further purification. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\):EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26-62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier. Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide **8** (0.9 g), without further purification. Amide **11** (7.0 mg) was isolated from fraction 55 (0.2 g), which was further purified by reversed phase HPLC [MeOH:H\\({}_{2}\\)O(4:1)]. Fraction 28 (0.4 g) was submitted to prep.

(Rubiaceae), a huge endemic tree from the Amazon, has been traditionally used for the treatment of numerous human ailments including mycoses, influenza, diverse infections, cancer and skin diseases throughout \"legal Amazonia,\" which includes Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia (Correa, 1974; Rizzini, 1978; Garcia, 1975). In Peruvian Amazon, a decoction of the bark is used against \"sarma nerga\", a subcutaneous infection caused by an arachinid (Schultes and Raffauf, 1990). In Brazilian Amazon, this species is known to treat stomach diseases, skin inflammation and uterus tumors (Garcia, 1975). As part of our continuing efforts to study Brazilian Rubiaceae, mainly those with medicinal uses (Carbonezi et al., 1998), _C. spruceanum_ DC was collected near Manaus, Amazon State, and submitted to a detailed chemical study. Three new _seco_-iridoids were obtained from the ethanolic extract of _C. spruceanum_ wood bark: 7-methoxydiderroside (**1**), 6'-acetyl-b-D-glucopyranosyldiderroside (**2**) and 8-\\(O\\)-tigolyldiderroside (**3**), and the known compounds loganetin (Houghton and Ming, 1985), loganin (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Garcia and Chulia, 1986), kingiside (Inouye et al., 1974), secoxyloganin (Calis and Sticher, 1984) and diderroside (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). Several natural products and synthetic compounds, e.g. sesquiterpenelactones from Asteraceae species (Chiari et al., 1991), lignans from _Virola surinamensis_ (Myristicaceae) (Lopes et al., 1998) and quinoline derivatives (Nakayama et al., 2001) have been evaluated for antitrypanosomal activity against _T. cruzi_, the parasite of Chagas disease, which affects ca. 18 million people in Latin America and ca. 100,000 people in the United States. Besides prophylaxis, i.e. the elimination of vector insect, specific therapeutic agents are needed in order to replace gentian violet, currently in use, owing to the mutagenic and\n\n## Page 2\n\ncarcinogenic potentials of this dye, as well as to consumer resistance to this treatment since the patient turns blue after transfusion. In this paper, the isolation and structure elucidation of the new _seco_-irridoids **1-3** along with the known compounds are presented. Additionally, the biological evaluation of all isolates against the trypanastigote forms (Y form) of _T. cruzi_ was undertaken. The taxonomic significance of these _seco_-irridoids in _C. spruceannum_, is also discussed.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe ethanolic extract of dried and powdered wood bark of _C. spruceannum_ was successively fractionated over a silica gel column and finally purified by reversed phase HPLC (see Experimental), affording the new _seco_-irridoids **1-3**. _seco_-Irridoid **1** was isolated as an amorphous powder that gave a [M+H]+ ion at _m_/_z_ 479.4539 in the high-resolution TOF-ESMS compatible with the molecular formula C20H30O13. The UV maximum at 230 nm and IR absorptions at 3450, 1695, 1635 and 1280 cm-1 suggested that **1** had a conjugated double bond and an end ether, which is characteristic of the chromophore -OCO-C=CH-O- of iridoids. This assumption was supported by the NMR signal observed at \\(d\\) 7.44 (1H, _s_) characteristic of H-3 from iridoids. Besides this signal, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed three doublets at \\(d\\) 5.66 (1H, \\(J\\) = 4.5 Hz), 4.54 (1H, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and 1.26 (3H, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz), one double quadruplet at \\(d\\) 4.97 (1H, \\(J\\) = 4.0; 6.5 Hz) and several signals compatible with a glucosyl unit. In addition, the signals at \\(d\\) 1.92 (3H, _s_), 3.54 (3H, _s_) and 3.58 (3H, _s_) analyzed with 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 2), revealed the presence of an acetyl and two methoxyl groups. The 13C NMR spectroscopic spectrum exhibited twenty signals (4CH3, 2CH2, 10CH, and 4C) whose chemical shift values and multiplicities obtained from the DEPT-135+ experiment strongly support the _seco_-iridoid skeleton for **1**, especially the signals of C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9 and C-10 at \\(d\\) 28.6, 34.7, 172.0, 68.6 and 42.2 respectively. The structure of **1** was confirmed by 2D-NMR spectral analysis including 1H-1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments. In the HMBC experiment, long-range correlations were observed between the following protons and carbons (H-1 and C-3, 5, 8, 1'; H-3 and C-5, 11; H-5 and C-3, 7, 1; H-8 and C-1, 5, 10, carbonyl of acetate) as shown in Fig. 1. The relative configuration of the stereogenic centers C-1, C-5, C-8 and C-9 was established by analyzing coupling constant values, NOESY experiments and comparison with literature data (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). The above evidence indicated **1** as the new derivative 7-methoxydiderroside (**1**).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline\n**H** & **1** & **2** & **3** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 5.66 \\(d\\) (4.5) & 5.58 \\(d\\) (6.5) & 5.76 \\(d\\) (6.5) \\\\\n3 & 7.44 \\(s\\) & 7.42 \\(d\\) (0.5) & 7.42 \\(s\\) \\\\\n4 & – & – & – \\\\\n5 & 3.10 \\(m\\) & 3.28 \\(m\\) & 3.20 \\(m\\) \\\\\n6 & 2.48 _dd_ (8.9, 16.02).85 _dd_ (7.5, 16.0) & – & 2.34 _dd_ (8.0, 16.0)2.78 _dd_ (7.2, 16.0) \\\\\n7 & – & – & – \\\\\n8 & 4.97 _dq_ (4.0, 6.5) & 5.00 _dq_ ( 4.5, 7.0) & 5.09 _dq_ (3.5, 6.5) \\\\\n9 & 2.08 _dd_ (4.0, 4.5, 9.5) & 2.12 _dd_ (4.5, 6.5, 9.0) & 2.16 _dd_ (3.5, 6.5, 8.5) \\\\\n10 & 1.26 \\(d\\) (6.5) & 1.27 \\(d\\) (7.0) & 1.30 \\(d\\) (6.5) \\\\\n11 & – & – & – \\\\\n1′ & 4.54 \\(d\\) (7.5) & 4.59 \\(d\\) (8.0) & 4.59 \\(d\\) (8.0) \\\\\n2′ & 3.18 _dl_ (7.5, 11.2) & 3.41 _dt_ (8.0, 9.5) & 2.99 \\(m\\) \\\\\n3′ & 3.16 \\(m\\) & 3.21 \\(m\\) & 3.18 \\(m\\) \\\\\n4′ & 3.12 \\(m\\) & 3.01 \\(m\\) & 3.01 \\(m\\) \\\\\n5′ & 3.06 \\(m\\) & 3.14 _dd_ (2.0, 6.5, 9.0) & 3.20 \\(m\\) \\\\\n6′ & 3.68 _dd_ (5.0, 12.4).73 _dd_ (5.7, 12.4) & 4.26 _dd_ (3.2, 12.0).06 _dd_ (6.5, 12.0) & 3.70 _dd_ (5.6, 11.5)3.98 _dd_ (6.8, 11.5) \\\\ OMe-7 & 3.58 \\(s\\) & 3.60 \\(s\\) & 3.59 \\(s\\) \\\\ OMe-11 & 3.54 \\(s\\) & – & – \\\\ AcO-8 & 1.92 \\(s\\) & 1.92 \\(s\\) & – \\\\ AcO-6′ & – & 2.0 \\(s\\) & – \\\\\n1′ & – & – & – \\\\\n2′′ & – & – & – \\\\\n3′′ & – & – & 6.79 _dq_ (1.5, 7.2) \\\\\n4′′ & – & – & 1.76 \\(d\\) (1.5) \\\\\n5′ & – & – & 1.74 _br s_ \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectral data for _seco_-irridoids **1–3** (500 MHz) in DMSO-_d_δ_a\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral signals (Tables 1 and 2) for compound **2** were found to be similar to those observed for **1**, except for the lack of one methoxyl group and one additional acetyl group. The change from one methoxyl to one acetyl group was also observed by HRTOF-ESMS, which showed a molecular ion peak at \\(m/z\\) [M + H]\\({}^{+}\\) 507.4725. In fact, when the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data of compound **2** were compared with those of diderroside, the only difference observed was the presence of one additional acetyl group inferred by the chemical shift values at \\(\\delta\\) 20.6 (correlating with the singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 2.00, in the HMQC spectrum), and \\(\\delta\\) 170.3. It was also observed that the signals attributed to the hydroxymethylene carbon and hydrogens in the glucosyl unit are deshielded [\\(\\delta\\) 63.4; 4.26 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 3.2, 12.0 Hz) and 4.06 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 12.0 Hz)], when compared with the values observed in a typical glucose moiety present in iridoids (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Boros and Stermitz, 1990; Boros and Stermitz, 1991). From the HMBC spectrum of **2** (Fig. 1), the diagnostic long-range correlations were observed, including those from H-8 to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 169.3; from H-10 to C-8 and C-9; and from H-6 to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 173.0. In addition, the correlation of H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\) to C-4\\({}^{\\prime}\\) and C-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\) as well as to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 170.3, established the position of the acetyl group at C-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\). The cross peak observed for the methyl at \\(\\delta\\) 2.00 to the carbonyl at \\(\\delta\\) 170.3, was definitive to indicate that this acetyl was linked to hydroxymethylene C-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\) of the glucosyl moiety and establish the structure of **2** as being 6\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-acetyl-b-d-glucopyranosyldiderroside.\n\nCompound **3** was obtained as a brown amorphous solid. The molecular formula, C\\({}_{22}\\)H\\({}_{32}\\)O\\({}_{13}\\) was established by HRTOF-ESMS (_m/z_ 527.4797 [M + Na]\\({}^{+}\\)). This compound also presented a sulphuric vanillin coloration identical to those of **1** and **2** suggesting that it was an iridoid. Its UV spectrum (\\(\\lambda_{\\rm max}^{\\rm MoOH}\\) 230, 297 nm), as well as its \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectral data indicated that\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline C & **1** & **2** & **3** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 94.9 & 95.0 & 94.1 \\\\\n3 & 152.5 & 152.1 & 152.1 \\\\\n4 & 108.7 & 109.1 & 109.1 \\\\\n5 & 28.6 & 28.0 & 28.0 \\\\\n6 & 34.7 & 34.6 & 34.4 \\\\\n7 & 172.0 & 173.0 & 173.0 \\\\\n8 & 68.6\n\n## Page 4\n\n3 consisted of a diderroside-like structure. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed one signal for hydrogen H-3 at \\(d\\) _d_ 7.42 (1H, _s_), which suggested the presence of an iridoid skeleton, a doublet at \\(d\\) 4.59 (1H, \\(J\\) = 8.0) and several signals ranging from \\(d\\) 2.99 to 3.70 attributed to the anomeric, methine and methylene hydrogens of the glucosyl moiety. The signals at \\(d\\) 5.09 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 3.5, 6.5 Hz), and 1.30 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz) were compatible with those from diderroside skeleton type for this compound, as in **1** and **2**. However, additional NMR spectral signals at \\(d\\) 6.79, 1.76 and 1.74, and the signals at \\(d\\) 137.4, 14.1 and 11.8, indicated that this compound exhibited significant differences from the signals observed in diderrosides **1** and **2**. The 1H-1H COSY spectrum from **3** showed a cross peak between the signal at \\(d\\) 6.79 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 1.5, 6.5) and the signal at \\(d\\) 1.76 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.5). In the HMQC experiments the signals at \\(d\\) 1.74 (3H, _br s_), 1.76 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 1.5) attributed to H-5'' and H-4'' respectively and \\(d\\) 6.79 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 1.5, 6.5), correlated with the carbons at \\(d\\) 11.8 (C-5''), 14.1 (C-4'') and 137.4 (C-3''), respectively. The combined analysis from these data and the presence of a _sp_2 carbon at \\(d\\) 128.1 suggested the existence of a tigloyl unit in this molecule, which was further determined to be linked at C-8 (_d_ 68.6). The HMBC correlations between the signal for H-8 at \\(d\\) 5.09 with carbons C-1'' (_d_ 166.3), C-10 (_d_ 18.8) and C-1 (_d_ 94.1); H-3 at \\(d\\) 7.42 with carbons C-11 (_d_ 166.2), C-4 (_d_ 109.1); methoxyl hydrogens with C-11; H-3'' at \\(d\\) 6.79 with C-4'' (_d_ 14.1), C-2'' (_d_ 128.1) and C-1'' (_d_ 166.3) corroborated the proposed structure for **3** as 8-_O_-tigolydidterroside.\n\nThis is the first report on the chemical composition of _C. sprucemann,_ a species included in Clinchonoidee, which revealed the presence of iridoid and _seco_-iridoids, a chemical profile quite different from those previously described (Bolzani et al., 1984). This sub-family is characterized by indole alkaloids, which are considered as their chemical markers (Young et al., 1996). A comparison of the chemical composition of _Calycophyllum_ with two species morphologically related such as _Chimarrhis_ (accumulates indole alkaloids) and _Bathysa_ (accumulates triterpenes and phenolics), revealed deep differences on the main isolated secondary metabolites. These species are often misplaced in their genera (Delprete, 1996), so further chemical studies on _Calycophyllum_ and allies will be useful to establish the boundaries of each genera, and will contribute to the taxonomic classification of Rubiaceae, which is considered a very complex taxon (Robbrecht, 1993).\n\nAll compounds were assayed in vitro against the trypanastigote forms (Y form) of _T. cruzi._ The new compounds **1**, **2** and the known secoxyloganin and diderroside displayed activity with IC50 values of 59.0, 90.2, 74.2 and 84.9 mg/ml, respectively, when compared with the standard gentian violet (IC50 7.5 mg/ml). Although these compounds have showed weak activities, to our knowledge this is the first report of the antitrypanosomal activity by _seco_-iridoids.\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nOptical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 degC. UV spectra were recorded on Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as internal standard. ES-MS was conducted on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRTOF-ESMS was performed using a Q-Tof (Micro-mass) (40 eV). CC was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Sephadex LH 20 (Pharmacia), respectively. TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Prep HPLC was performed on Waters Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C-18 (250 mm x 21.20 mm, Phenomenex) columns.\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _C. sprucemann_ plant material was collected in Manaus, Brazil, in July and August 1998. A voucher specimen was identified by Dr. J. A. da S. Cabral and deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA), Manaus (Voucher No 1998-182.249).\n\n### Bioassay screening\n\nIn vitro assay using trypanastigote forms (Y strain) from _T. cruzi_ was performed according to the protocol described in the literature (Bastos et al., 1999).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nPulverized dried wood bark from _C. sprucemann_ (1.7 kg) was extensively extracted using MeOH at room temp. The combined extracts were concentrated in vacuo to give a dark solid (230 g), which was partitioned between _n_-BuOH and H2O affording an _n_-BuOH (64 g) and an aqueous (107 g) soluble fraction. The _n_-BuOH fraction was suspended in aqueous MeOH 80% and successively partitioned with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction (20.8 g) was subjected to XAD-2 chromatograph using H2O with increasing proportions of MeOH (20-100%). Fractions I and II, obtained from this procedure, were further submitted to CC using Sephadex LH 20 as stationary phase and MeOH as isocratic mobile phase, yielding 21 fractions (F1-F21).\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nF-5 was further purified by means of HPLC coupled to a prep reversed phase column using MeOH/H2O/HOAC (23:76.6:0.5) as mobile phase, UV detection set at 280 nm and a flow rate of 10 mL.min-1, gave pure loganin (11.6 mg), diderroside (5.3 mg) and the new derivative **3** (11.6 mg). F-11 was purified with a similar chromatographic procedure, only varying the mobile phase MeOH/H2O (27.5:72.5), giving diderroside (12.3 mg). Fraction F-18 was also subjected to HPLC purification using MeOH/H2O/HOAc (27:72.5:0.5) as mobile phase, flow rate set at 8 mL.min-1 to afford secoxilogenin (5.7 mg), loganetin (2.0 mg), diderroside (2.1 mg) and the new compounds **1** (11 mg), **2** (13.6 mg) and **3** (1.2 mg).\n\n#### 3.4.1 Diderroside methyl ester (1)\n\nAmorphous powder; [a]25-36.0deg (MeOH; \\(c\\) 1.4); UV _l_max (CH3OH) nm (log _e_): 230 (4.6), 210.6 (4.2); IR _v_max (KBr) cm-1: 3450, 2944, 1712, 1695, 1635, 1280.

The species _Piper aduncum_ L. is used as remedy for stomach aches and as an insect repellent (Asprey & Thornton, 1954). Previous investigations on _P. aduncum_ have described phenylpropanoids, such as myristicin and dillapiol, benzoic acid derivatives, chromenes and flavonoids (Burke & Nair, 1986; Orjala, Eldelmeier, Wright, Rali, & Sticher, 1993a; 1993b; Moreira, Guimaraes, & Kaplan, 1998). During the course of chemical studies on _P. aduncum_ we isolated seven compounds, including a new chromene **1** and a new benzoic acid derivative **5**. In the search for potential anticancer agents employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka, Samaranayake, Kingston, Hofmann, & Johnson, 1992; Gunatilaka, Kingston, & Johnson, 1994), it was found that the chromenes 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-chromeene-6-carboxylate acid (**1**), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3'-methyl-2'-butenyl)-2_H_-1-chromeene-6-carboxylate (**2**), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-chromeene-6-carboxylate (**3**), methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-chromeene-6-carboxylate (**4**) and the benzoic acid derivative, 3-(3',7'-dimethyl-2',6'-occtadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**5**), were active. Although chromene and benzoic acid derivatives are frequently isolated from _Piper_ species and many of them exhibit diverse biological activity such as antimicrobial, molluscicidal (Orijala et al., 1993b), germination inhibition, fungicidal (Nair & Burke, 1990) and insecticidal activities (Bernard et al., 1995), there is no previous report describing damaging effect on DNA. In this paper we report the structure elucidation for two new isolated compounds **1** and **5** and the growth inhibitory effects of compounds **1-5** against strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nA CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)-soluble part of MeOH extract of the leaves of _P. aduncum_ was fractionated by CC on silica gel followed by HPLC to afford compounds **1**-**5**, neor-lidol and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone.\n\n2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-chrome-6-carboxylic acid (**1**) was shown to have a molecular formula C\\({}_{12}\\)H\\({}_{12}\\)O\\({}_{3}\\) by analysis of its electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS), \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 2400-3400/1680 and 1600/1445 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) characteristic of carboxylic acid and aromatic groups, respectively. Its \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum exhibited close similarities to those of 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-chrome-6-carboxylate **3** (Burke & Nair, 1986) by the presence of two doublets at \\(\\delta\\) 5.65 and 6.34 (9.9 Hz) and a singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 1.46 (2 CH\\({}_{3}\\)) and, as in the case of **3**, its spectrum showed three aromatic signals at \\(\\delta\\) 7.86 (dd, \\(J\\) = 2.0 and 8.4 Hz), 7.72 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz) and 6.79 (d, \\(J\\) = 8.4 Hz), corroborating the presence of a trisubstituted aromatic ring. As indicated by IR and by \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra (Table 1), the methyl ester function in **3** was replaced by a carboxylic acid function (\\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 171.0) and the structure of compound **1** was determined as depicted.\n\n3-(3',7'-dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**5**) has the molecular formula C\\({}_{18}\\)H\\({}_{22}\\)O\\({}_{4}\\) deduced by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data. In its IR spectrum, absorptions for an aromatic acid carbonyl group (1680 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and an aromatic ring (1600, 1490 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) were present, while the UV spectrum displayed an absorption maximum at 254 nm (\\(\\log\\epsilon\\) 3.8) corresponding to the aromatic ring.\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of **5** showed signals corresponding to three coupled aromatic resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 6.87 (d, 1H, \\(J\\) = 8.4 Hz), 7.88 (d, 1H, \\(J\\) = 2.2 Hz) and 7.96 (dd, 1H \\(J\\) = 8.4, 2.2 Hz) for a 1,4,5-tri-substituted aromatic ring and \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) 1.34 (1H, s); it also displayed a singlet at 3.90 (3H, s) for a carboxylic acid\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} \\hline  & **1** & & **5** & \\\\ \\cline{2-4}  & H & C\\({}^{\\rm a}\\) & H & C\\({}^{\\rm a}\\) \\\\ \\hline\n1 & & – & – & – & 122.5 (s) \\\\\n2 & & – & 77.2 (q) & 7.88 d (2.2) & 130.8\\({}^{\\rm b}\\) (d) \\\\\n3 & 5.65 d (9.9) & 131.0 (d) & – & 129.7\\({}^{\\rm b}\\\n\n## Page 3\n\nfunction and an aryl methoxyl group, which were confirmed by the signals at _d_C 168.4 and 55.2, respectively, in its 13C NMR spectrum. The monoterpene side chain signals were determined from DQCOSY and HETCOR spectra. Thus, the methylene protons H-1' at \\(d\\) 3.34 (2H, d, \\(J\\) = 7.3 Hz) were coupled to the olefinic proton H-2' at \\(d\\) 5.31 (1H, t, \\(J\\) = 7.3 Hz), which in turn showed an allylic coupling to the methyl group H-9' at \\(d\\) 1.71 (3H, s). The methine proton H-6' at \\(d\\) 5.10 (1H, t, \\(J\\) = 7.2 Hz) was further coupled to the methylene proton H-5' at \\(d\\) 2.07 (2H, m). The \\(E\\) geometry for the D23'-double bond was established on the basis of the 13C NMR data of the vinyl methyl group H-9' (De Haan & van de Ven, 1973). The position of the monoterpene moiety was deduced by NOESY spectrum analysis and by comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data with those published for methyl 3-(3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octaldenyl)-4-methoxybenzoicate (Orjala et al., 1993b).\n\nThe known compounds 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-2_H_-chromene-6-carboxylate (**2**), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (**3**), methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (**4**) and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrohalcone were previously isolated from the same source (Burke & Nair, 1986; Diaz, Arias, & Nathan, 1987; Orjala et al., 1993a; Moreira et al., 1998), while nerolidol (Ramos, Da Silva, Luz, Zoghbi, & Maia, 1986) was isolated for the first time from _P. aduncum_.\n\nCompounds **1**-**5** were evaluated against genetically engineered mutants of yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ and have showed IC12 values of 120 and 100; 130 and 100; 105 and 120; 110 and 120; 130 and 120 mg/ml against the mutant yeast strains RS 321N and RS 322YK (_rad_ 52Y), respectively. Even though the activity could be considered weak, they were selective towards mutant strains lacking DNA cleavage repair mechanism since they were inactive (IC12 > 1,000 mg/ml) against the 'wild type' strain RS 188N (_rad_ +) (Gunatilaka et al., 1992; 1994). As there is no previous report on the activity of chromene compounds on DNA, the data obtained here are the basis for our further search for antitumoral or fungicidal compounds in the Piperaceae.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Instrumentation and chromatography materials\n\nSilica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reversed phase column (Waters Nova Pak, C18; 3.9 x 150 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (3:2), flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 254 nm.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Piper aduncum_ L. (Piperaceae) leaves were collected at Reserva da Ripasa, Ibate, SP and identified by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru). The voucher specimen is deposited at Departamento de Ecologia, Instituto de Biociencias-USP.\n\n### Bioassays\n\nThe screening methods utilizing mutant strains of _S. cerevisiae_ have been described elsewhere (Gunatilaka et al., 1992). IC12 values refer to the concentration in mg/ml required to produce an inhibition zone of 12 mm diameter around a 100 ml well during a 48 h incubation period at 37degC. The positive control campothecin was active at 5.0 ml/ml for RS 322YK and at 200 ml/ml for RS 188N; streptonigrin was active at 4.0 ml/ml for RS 321N.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of constituents\n\nThe CH2Cl2-soluble part of MeOH extract of powdered leaves of _P. aduncum_ (24.0 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing increasing volumes of EtOHAc (up to 100%) to give 46 fractions (A1-A46). Fraction A3 (961.5 mg) was applied to a silica gel column (2.5 g) 230-400 mesh, eluted with hexane containing increasing concentrations of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 14 fractions (B1-B14). Fraction B2 afforded compound **2** (13.0 mg). Fraction A4 (218.0 mg) was chromatographed via silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 10 fractions (C1-C10). Fraction C5 (133.0 mg) yielded pure compound **3** (23.0 mg). Fraction A5 was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give nerolidol (180 mg). Fraction A11 (675.6 mg) yielded the pure compound **4** (171 mg). Fraction A13 (980.0 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 90%) to give the compound 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrohalcone (408.0 mg). Fraction A14, a green gum (25.0 mg), was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC, as described in the general experimental procedures, to give **5** (12.3 mg). The dried and powdered leaves (1.003 g) of _P. aduncum_ were extracted \n\n## Page 4\n\nwith EtOAc (five times, 150 ml each). The resulting extract (325.6 mg) was dissolved in CHCl3 and partitioned with an aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (six times, 50 ml each). The aqueous fraction was neutralized with HCl (6 N) and submitted to partition with EtOAc (three times, 100 ml each) to give a residue (248.0 mg). This fraction (248.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC eluted with CHCl3:MeOH (98:2) and HOAc (1%) to give 12.0 mg of compound **1**.\n\n_2,2-Dimethyl_-2H-_1-chromene_-_6-_carboxylic acid_ (**1**): amorphous solid; UV (MeOH) \\(\\lambda_{\\max}\\) (\\(\\log\\epsilon\\)): 240 nm (1.9); IR \\(\\nu_{\\max}\\) (KBr): 2400-3400, 3010, 2920, 2870, 1680, 1610, 1485, 1440, 1135 cm\\({}^{-1}\\); ES-MS \\(m/z\\) (rel int): 205 [M + 1] (100); 1H and 13C NMR, see Table 1.\n\n_3-(3',7'-Dimethyl-2',6'-ocatedienyl)-4-methoxybenzoicacid_ (**5**): amorphous solid; UV (MeOH) \\(\\lambda_{\\max}\\) (\\(\\log\\epsilon\\)): 254 nm (3.8); IR \\(\\nu_{\\max}\\) (KBr): 2400-3400, 3005, 1680, 1640, 1600, 1488, 1445, 1130 cm\\({}^{-1}\\); ES-MS \\(m/z\\) (rel int): 303 [M + 1] (100); 1H and 13C NMR, see Table 1.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was funded by grants from FAPESP, PADCT and CNPq.

A literature analysis pointed out its importance as a source of premylated bioactive molecules. The screening performed on aromatic acceptors (benzoic acids, phenols and phenylpropanoids) including geranyl diphosphate as premyl donor, showed the biotransformation of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid by the crude extract, and the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid by both the microsomal fraction and the crude extract, after treating leaves with glucose. The analysis of the products allowed the identification of _C_- and 0-geranylated derivatives, and the protease (subtilisin and pepsin) inhibition performed on the 0-geranylated compounds showed weak inhibition. Electrophoretic profiles indicated the presence of bands/spots among 56-58 kDa and pl 6-7, which are compatible with premyltransferases. These findings show that \\(P\\). _crassinervium_ could be considered as a source of extracts with geranyltransferase activity to perform biotransformations on aromatic substrates.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nBiotransformations are chemical reactions catalyzed by cells, organs or enzymes. They are different from biosynthesis, where complex products are assembled from simple substrates by whole cells, organs or organisms. Plant enzyme biocatalysts can be utilized to introduce new structural motifs on existing drugs expecting to improve their bioactivity, pharmacokinetic profile and also for the production of new drugs (Giri et al., 2001).\n\nSo far, natural products bearing one or more premyl groups have been isolated predominantly from higher plants. These compounds, originated from several natural product classes, often hold antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer activities (Epifano et al., 2008). Since the premylation of small aromatic molecules is a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of many natural products, the access to prenylation reaction catalysts might represent an advantageous short-cut to obtain premylated aromatic compounds (Yazaki et al., 2001; Haagena et al., 2007).\n\nAromatic geranyltransferases are a sub-class of premyltransferases that catalyzes _C_-geranylations on several aromatic substrates. Several examples of new aromatic premyltransferases have been reported from bacteria as soluble monomeric biocatalysts, with a relatively high promiscuity for aromatic substrates. In spite of the lack of a full elucidation of substrate- and regioselectivity, these enzymes were successfully employed to carry out either _C_- or _O_-prevalations of several compounds (Epifano et al., 2008). In plants, aromatic geranyltransferases are membrane-bound proteins, showing a strict substrate specificity for the endogenous premyl donor groups (e.g. DMAPP, GPP, etc.), although they may accept a variety of aromatic compounds as acceptors of the premyl moieties (Yazaki et al., 2001; Kuzuyama et al., 2005). There are few examples in which premyltransferases have been isolated and characterized from plants (Muhlenwege et al., 1998). Therefore, biotransformations using plant enzymatic extracts enriched in premyltransferase activity could be used as an alternative to obtain either known or new bioactive compounds.\n\nPiperaceae family is a basal angiosperm family, comprising more than 4000 species. Its species are chemically very rich and major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Parmar et al., 1997; Benesvides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003; Felippe et al., 2008), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alecio et al., 1998; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005). Belonging to this \n\n## Page 2\n\nfamily, _Piper_ is one of the most abundant genera, with approximately 2000 species (Wanke et al., 2007). _Piper crassineurium_ species accumulates antifungal, trypanocidal and antioxidant C-geranylated metabolites derived from both benzoic acid and _p_-hydroquinone (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008).\n\nIn spite of the knowledge on the chemical constituents and the biological potential of Piperaceae species, no comprehensive study has been made in order to survey such bioactive metabolites within the members of the family.\n\nHere we present a compilation that points out to the importance of _Piper_ genus as a source of bioactive compounds and, particularly, of _P. crassineurium_ as an enzyme source to perform geranylations on aromatic substrates. We report the biotransformation (i.e. the geranylation) of both the _p_-hydroxybenzoic and 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acids carried out by the enzymatic extracts from the leaves of _P. crassineurium_ besides the full characterization of two products as geranyl ester derivatives in addition to the characterization of one major product formed by biotransformation of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a C-geranylated derivative. Additionally, the inhibitory activity on HIV-like proteases was determined for the products as well as the electrophoretic characterization of catalytically active protein fractions by using SDS PAGE and 2-DE.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Literature survey and analysis\n\n'Piperaceae' and 'activity' were used as key words to perform a search in the available databases (e.g. _Science Direct_ and _ACS_ databases). All the obtained information was uploaded in a table according to genus, species, type of compound and biological activity reported (see the Electronic Annex in the online version of this article). Typical software Excel 2007(r) (Microsoft Corporation) was used to analyse and plot the obtained information.\n\n### Plant material\n\nFresh leaves of _P. crassineurium_ were collected from adults specimens cultivated from seeds under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara, SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo-Peru) and the voucher specimen (Kato-0084) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\n\nIncubation into _b_-D-glucose of young leaves from _P. crassineurium_. Leaves freshly excised from an adult plant were placed separately in 1.5 ml Eppendorf(r) tubes and each administrated 100 ml from a 10% solution of _b_-D-glucose in water at 25 degC for 72 h (Bergamo et al., 2005).\n\n### Synthesis and purification of geranyl diphosphate (GPP)\n\nIn a 100 ml round bottom flask 1 mmol of geraniol was mixed with 6 mmol of trichloroacetonitrile. Bis-triethylammonium phosphate (2.4 mmol in 20 ml of acetonitrile) was added drop-wise to the mixture over a period of 6 h, at room temperature under continuous stirring (Cornforth and Popjak, 1969). The mixture was further stirred for 12 h at room temperature and then, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 100 ml of ethyl ether, followed by extraction with 30 ml of NH4OH 0.1 M (3x). The basic solution was then re-extracted with 30 ml of ethyl ether (3x) and evaporated under reduced pressure. The GPP was purified by precipitation in acetonitrile at -20 degC overnight, compared with a commercial sample using TLC on cellulose (isopropanol/25% aqueous ammonia/water 50:25:25) and characterized by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): \\(d\\) 4.44 (H-1, \\(d\\) = 7.0 Hz), 5.41 (H-2, \\(t\\) = 7.0 Hz), 2.02-2.15 (H-4 and H-5, _m_), 5.17 (H-6, _m_), 1.59 (-_CH_3 = 8, _s_), 1.65 (-_CH_3 = 9, _s_), 1.66 (-_CH_3 = 10, _s_), 1.3C NMR (125 MHz, D2O): \\(d\\) 63.0 (-1, 1.243 (C-3, _d_), 143.6 (C-3, _d_), 2.58 (C-5), 120.0 (C-6), 133.9 (C-7), 2.50 (C-8), 1.72 (C-9) and 15.8 (C-10), 31P NMR (H3PO4, 202 MHz, D2O): \\(d\\) -9.75 (P-1), -1.40 (P-2).\n\nSynthesis, purification and characterization of the 0-geranyl derivatives of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid\n\nTo a stirred solution of the 3.4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2 mmol) in dry DMF (10 ml), anhydrous potassium carbonate (6 mmol) was added and the solution stirred for 30 min at 40 degC under nitrogen atmosphere (Pisco et al., 2006). Geranyl bromide (4 mmol) was added drop-wise and the resulting mixture was heated and stirred at the same temperature for 8 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then poured into cold water (50 ml) added with 0.1% of HOAc, and extracted with CHCl3 (100 ml) and EtOAc (100 ml). The EtOAc layer was washed, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was submitted to column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230-400 mesh), iso-cratic elution with Hex-EtOAc (60:40)] yielding five fractions. Fraction 2 was characterized as compound **3**, fraction 4 as compound **4** and fraction 5 as compound **5**. The purified products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Fig. 4, Table 1).\n\nSynthesis, purification and characterization of the 0-geranyl derivatives of the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid\n\nThe _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid (1 mmol) dissolved in 5 ml of THF was added to a slurry of 5 g of Al2O3 neutral in ether (1 ml) (Glusenkamp and Buchi, 1986). The solvent was evaporated and geranyl bromide (3 mmol) in ether-hexane (30:70) was added. After stirring during 4 days, Al2O3 was filtered off and washed with 1% HOAC in EtOAc. The combined organic layer was evaporated and the products were purified using column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230-400 mesh), gradient elution with Hex 100%, Hex-EtOAc (90:10; 80:20; 50:50)], yielding 7 fractions. From fraction 3 it was characterized the geranyl ester derivative (**6**), whereas the geranyl ether derivative (**7**) was purified from fraction 4 by subsequent column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230-400 mesh), isocratic elution with Hex-EtOAc (80:20)]. The purified products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Table 2, Fig. 5).\n\n### Protein extraction\n\nLeaves of _P. crassineurium_ were harvested from an adult specimen and maintained in liquid N2. The frozen leaves (10 g) were triturated in a mortar with addition of 35% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 30 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 8). The homogenate was stirred slowly by 15 min in ice bath, filtered on gauze and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant (crude enzymatic extract), which was then submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis.\n\n### Microsomal fraction\n\nThe protocol was performed according to Muhlenweg et al. (1998) with minimal modifications. The supernatant (20 ml) obtained as described in Section 2.6 was subjected to ultracentrifuga\n\n## Page 3\n\ntion at 39,000 rpm for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 1 M KCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol, and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspension was subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. The supernatant was discarded, and the tube was carefully rinsed with 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The pellet was then resuspended in 10 ml of 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 2 M KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 4 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonium]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPSO), and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspension was ultracentrifuged as described above, and the desired proteins were recovered as supernatant, which was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (9.0 cm long, 1.0 cm i.d.), previously equilibrated with the 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1.5 mM CHAPSO, 2 mM DTT and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The eluate was submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis.\n\n### Protein determination\n\nThe protein determination was performed by the Bradford modified method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard (Stoscheck, 1990).\n\n### Detection of the geranyltransferase activity\n\nThe reaction mixture (100 ml) containing 100 mM KPi (pH 8.0), 10 mM of precursors, 10 mM GPP, 10 mM MgCl2 (or MnCl2) and 65 ml of the proteic extract was incubated under stirring for 60 min at 35 degC. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 5 ml of 6 M HCl and extracted with 150 ml of EOAc. After vortex and centrifugation, the organic layer was evaporated, the residue dissolved in MeOH (100 ml) and analysed by HPLC-UV, using a Phenomenex GEMINI(r) column (5 mm C18 110 A, 250 x 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic condition (25 min) consisted of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous HOAc (30%), with detection at 254 and 280 nm. Injection volume: 50 ml. For each reaction, two negative controls, which consisted of: (1) enzymatic extract + buffer and (2) precursor + divalent cation + GPP + buffer, were carried out simultaneously. Each experiment was performed in duplicate.\n\n### Sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)\n\nThe SDS PAGE was performed according to the supplier information (GE Healthcare(r)). The 12% polyacrylamide gels were stained with AgNO3. The relative molecular mass (_M_r) of denatured proteins was estimated using the Lablmage 1D(r) software calibrated with low molecular weight standards (phosphorylase \\(b\\), serialbumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase and trypsin inhibitor, with 97.4, 66.2, 45.0, 31.0, 21.5 and 14.4 kDa, respectively).\n\n### Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE)\n\nThe 2-DE with immobilized pH gradients (IPG-Dalt) was carried out according to the supplier information (GE Healthcare(r)). The IPG strips (13 cm) were rehydrated for 14-18 h with sample proteins previously treated with the Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare(r))\n\n## Page 4\n\nin an Immobiline DryStrip Reswelling Tray. First dimension isoelectric focusing (IEF) was carried out in an Ettan IPCphor II Manifold applying a manufacturer's standard protocol. The second dimension was performed on a vertical (\\(14\\times 16\\) cm) 12% polyacrylamide SDS gel, in a SE 600 Ruby System, 45 mA/gel and 600 V. Each gel was stained with silver according to the Silver Staining Protocol (Amersham Biosciences(r)).\n\n### Inhibition of the protease activity\n\n#### 2.12.1 Reagents\n\nPepsin was from porcine gastric mucous. Recombinant Type VIII Subtilisin Carlsberg, Arg-Glu-(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln-Lys-(DABCYL)-Arg fluorogenic substrate (EDANS-DABCYL) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) spectrophotometric grade, were from Sigma-Aldrich, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n#### 2.12.2 Protease activity assay\n\nThe assays were performed in triplicate. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) for subtilisin and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.4) for pepsin, respectively. Warfarin and dicouamod were used as positive controls (Thaisiromgs et al., 1994; Pochet et al., 2000). Samples and standard inhibitors (1 mg/ml) were pre-incubated with subtilisin (37 nM) or pepsin (1.7 nM) for 1 h, and then transferred to a black opaque microplate to be tested. The substrate EDANS-DABCYL (2 mM) was prepared in the specific buffer for each protease. In the control assay only protease and substrate were used. Proteases were prepared in the day of the experiment and the tests were performed for each one separately. Readings were made using 360 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission) filters during 7 min, with 1 min intervals, at 37 degC (Hirata et al., 2005). The fluorescence intensity was used to calculate the % of inhibition as follows:\n\n\\[\\% I = 100 - \\left[ \\left( \\Delta\\text{Fs}/\\Delta\\text{Fp} \\right) \\ast 100 \\right]\\]\n\nwhere, \\(\\Delta\\text{Fs}\\) and \\(\\Delta\\text{Fp}\\) are the difference between the first and last readings for the sample test and the control, respectively.\n\nFluorescence bioassay data were collected with a multidetection microplate reader Synergy(tm) HT and analysed using the KCA software (Bio-Tek(r) Instruments, Inc.) and Microsoft Windows XP(r).\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\nPrenylation is a chemical or enzymatic addition of a hydrophobic side chain to an accepting molecule (another terpenoid molecule, an aromatic compound, a protein, etc.). In particular, the prenylation of aromatic secondary metabolites plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of a wide range of molecules exerting valuable pharmacological effects. Several examples can be found in phylogenetically different classes of living organisms, from bacteria across mammals to plants (Epifano et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nstudied partially due to their wide occurrence and biomass availability (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex).\n\nAmong _Piper_ genus, 44 species were subjected to photochemical or bioactivity investigations, being _P. cubeba_ the most intensively studied with near 8%, followed by _P. longum_ and _P. aduncum_ with 7%, _P. methystcium_ and _P. tubercultum_ with 6%, _P. sanctum, P. nigrum and _P. crassinevium_ with 5% (Fig. 1). Only nine studies with _Peperoma_ species were found, with _P. duclouxii_ (28%), _P. dindygulensis_ (18%) and _P. galioides_ (13%), being the three mentioned most frequently.\n\nConsidering the type of compounds, they were grouped based on their structural characteristics, as follows: ALK (alkaloids and other substances bearing nitrogen), LG (ligmans, neoligans and related compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPRP (preparlated benzopyrans), HQPR (preparlated hydroquinones), BPR (preparlated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (flavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopytrans), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (steroids), CHX (cyclohexanic derivatives), KLN (kavalacotones, pyrones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives), (Fig. 2A). Their distribution shows the prevalence of nitrogenated substances (ALK), ligands (LG) and flavonoids (FLV) in _Piper_ species. Nevertheless some differences could be observed in _Peperomia_, where LG (lignoids) and BPPR (preplated benzopyrans) were the most abundant (Fig. 2A).\n\nRegarding biological activities, the grouping was performed considering the biological target in order to simplify as follows: **snc** (involving activities related to central nervous system, such as sedative and relaxant), **tryp** (antiprotozaol activity against _Tympanosoma_, _Plasmodium_, _Leishmania_), **cyt** (cytotoxicity and related activities), **atb** (anticmicropholi, such as antibacterial and antifungal), **can** (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more specifically targeted), **insec** (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti-mosquito or ant), **aox** (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), **enz** (inhibitory activity against several enzymes), **aai** (anti-inflammatory activity), **acoa** (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), **iger** (allelophatic activity), **photo** (photo-protecting activity), **cic** (cicatrizing activity) and **avir** (antiviral activity). The obtained distribution shows that _Piper_ genus is mostly related to antibacterial and antiprotozaol activities, followed by anti-inflammatory and enzymatic inhibitory activities, while _Peperomia_ appears to be mostly related to cytotoxic and antiprotozaol activities. Only _Pothomorph_ genus showed some relationship with antiviral activity (Fig. 2B).\n\nFig. 2.: (A) Distribution by type of bioactive compounds reported by genera in Piperaceae family, ALK (substances bearing nitrogen at the molecule), LG (ligmans, neoligans and related compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPPR (preprylated benzopyrans), HQPR (preparlated hydroquinones), BPR (preprylated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (flavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopyrans), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (cytochastic derivatives), KLN (kavalacotones, pyrones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives). (B) Distribution observed by biological activity groups for each genus reported: **snc** (related to central nervous system, such as sedative and relaxant), **tryp** (antiprotozaol activity against _Tympanosoma_, _Plasmodium_, **civ** (cytotoxicity and related), **atb** (anticmicropholi, such as antibacterial and antifungal), **can** (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more specifically targeted), **insec** (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti-mosquito or ant), **aox** (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), **enz** (inhibitory activity against several enzymes), **aai** (antiinflammatory activity), **acoa** (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), **iger** (allelophatic activity), **photo** (photo-protecting activity), **cic** (cicatrizing activity) and **avir** (antiviral activity). The obtained distribution shows that _Piper_ genus is mostly related to antibacterial and antiprotozaol activities, followed by anti-inflammatory and enzymatic inhibitory activities, while _Peperomia_ appears to be mostly related to cytotoxic and antiprotozaol activities. Only _Pothomorph_ genus showed some relationship with antiviral activity (Fig. 2B).\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nAbout preplated natural products, i.e., all the compounds bearing one or more prepally, geranyl, farnesyl or geranyl/ary moieties as substituents in their basic structures, open or cycled (BP, BPR, BPR and HQPR), they could be found in _Preperomia_, _Pothornorph_ and in _Piper_ species (Fig. 2). In addition, they are mostly related to antimicrobial (**arb**), insecticidal (**insec**) and antioxidant activity (**aox**), being the prenylated benzoic acid derivatives (BPR) from _Piper_ species, the group with the most biological activities reported (Fig. 3).\n\nThe analysis for the occurrence of major secondary compounds pointed out that _Piper_ species could be considered as an important source of prenylated compounds and thus a source for further studies of prenyltransferase activity. The two species _P. crassinevium_ and _P. aduncum_ accounted for 11% of the total number of species in which bioactive substances have been reported for this genus and can be considered good candidates for further investigation on bioactive prenylated metabolites (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex).\n\nConsidering the literature survey performed here as well as our previous experience on both bioactivity and biosynthetic studies of prenylated compounds from some _Piper_ species, _P. crassinevium_ was selected for further studies (Lopes et al., 2008). This species accumulates two C-geranylated metabolites derived from benzoic acid [4-hydroxy-3-_E_-(3',7'-dimethyl-1'-_oxo-2',6'-octalenyl)benzoic acid (**1**)] and from 1,4-benzenediol [(1,4-dihydroxy-2',6'-octalenyl)benzene (**2**)], which showed antifungal, antioxidant and trypanacid activities (Fig. 1) (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008).\n\nA screening for the prenylation activity with the crude enzymatic extract from fresh leaves of _P. crassinevium_ plus geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as the prenyl donor, a divalent cation (MgCl2 or MnCl2) and several aromatic substrates (_p_-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, _p_-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phenol, _p_-hydroquinone, caffeic acid, _o_- and _p_-counter acids) was initially performed. Neither the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid nor the _p_-hydroquinone (the two theoretically natural precursors of compounds **1** and **2**) was biotransformed, whilst the reaction with the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid led to the formation of products, as observed in the chromatographic profile, suggesting a biotransformation reaction when compared with that of the negative control. The reaction was consistently reproducible and the product was analysed by HPLC-UV-MS showing an intense peak at _t_R: 13.1 min with _l_max at 280 nm besides some minor compounds between _t_R: 7-9 min (Fig. 4). The fact that the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid could be bio-transformed is interesting because no prenylated natural products bearing a catechol moiety have been isolated from _P. crassinevium_ previously.\n\nThe characterization of the biotransformation products was performed by the analysis of their UV-Vis and MS or tandem MS-MS (ESI negative mode) spectra, as well as by comparison with synthetic compounds prepared for this purpose: the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid geranyl ester (compound **3**), the 4-0-geranyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound **4**) and the 3-0-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound **5**) (Table 1).\n\nRegarding the minor products detected (chromatographic peaks detected at 254 nm with _t_R between 7 and 9 min), their mass (MS) spectra were investigated and compared to those of the synthetic compounds **3**-5. This analysis and the comparison of the chromatographic profiles, UV (_A_max 258 and 295 nm) and MS spectra ([M-H]- = 289, [M-C10H17]- = 153 and [M-C10H17-C02]- = 109) with those of the negative controls (see Section 2.9) allowed the determination of the product eluted at _t_R: 8.6 min as the geranyl ester of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (**3**) (Fig. 4).\n\nThe compound eluted at _t_R: 13.1 min displayed a [M-H]- = 303, which under subsequent fragmentation by MS-MS, gave rise to the fragment ion _m_/_z_ = 259, indicating the loss of a CO2 molecule (Fig. 4). Considering that the addition of one geranyl moiety to this aromatic core produces a molecule with MW = 290, an additional oxidation at the geranylic chain was suggested on the basis of the MW = 304 observed, compatible with additional 14 unites to the MW = 290. This suggestion was based on the observation of the oxidation pattern of the isolated metabolites **1** and **2**, which have a carbonyl carbon at their geranyl moieties (Fig. 1). The position of the geranyl moiety could be proposed as a _C_- (at the aromatic ring) instead of an _O_-substitution (at a phenol group), due to the lack of the fragment at _m_/_z_ = 153 in the MS-MS spectrum (Fig. 4). The position of the oxidation at the geranyl moiety was assumed to be at C-5', due to the observation of the fragment ions at _m_/_z_ = 203 and 159, which could result from a McLafferty-type rearrangement (Fig. 4) (Grossert et al., 2006).\n\nSince plant prenyltransferase are mostly membrane-associated enzymes, an additional protocol on the crude extract was performed to obtain a microsomal fraction (Muhlenwege et al., 1998). The process was monitored by electrophoresis SDS PAGE and 2-DE, and the microsomal fraction was evaluated for its geranyltransferase activity having _p_-hydroquinone, _p_-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids as aromatic acceptors. No products were detected when _p_-hydroquinone and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid were used as substrates. Nevertheless, the analysis indicated that the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid was biotransformed yielding a new product as a weak chromatographic peak (_t_R: 13.6 min), absent in the negative controls. The chromatographic profile of the obtained product was compared with those of the endogenous (**1**) and synthetic (**6** and **7**, Table 2) compounds, suggesting that the product of this biotransformation could be an 0-geranylated derivative (Fig. 5).\n\nPrevious studies carried out by our research group with leaves of _P. crassinevium_ have demonstrated that compounds **1** and **2** were biosynthesized _de novo_ after incubation for three days with glucose (unpublished results). Consequently, a protocol of feeding glucose by pre-incubation of fresh leaves from _P. crassinevium_ with a 10% aqueous solution was applied to enhance the expression of the geranyltransferase activity.\n\nSubsequent to the enzymatic reaction, the synthesis of the expected product was enhanced, being possible to identify it as the geranyl geranyl ester of the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid **6** both in the crude extract and in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 5). This result is\n\nFig. 3: Distribution of prenylated bioactive metabolites by genera within Piperaceae family.

Nevertheless, from the analysis of the spectral data of the product\n\nFig. 4: Typical chromatogram obtained for the biotransformation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, using GPP and the crude enzymatic extract from the leaves of _P_-_crasinerurum_, which shows the product identified as compound **3** at \\(t\\)2; 8.6 min, and the proposed fragmentation pattern of the product eluted at \\(t\\)2; 13.1 min, based on the analysis of its MS and tandem MS-MS.

(2007), we propose that it is the ester derivative instead of the ether, as reported. The expected chemical shift value for the CH2-1' at \\(d\\) observed in the 1H NMR, should be similar for the two derivatives **6** and **7** and, therefore this data should not be enough to distinguish which derivative was formed. Thus, further NMR experiments including analysis of the 13C NMR values and the _g_HMBC correlations were carried out.\n\nThe observed differences in the substrate specificity, suggest the presence of, at least, two geranyltransferases in _P.__cassinevium_. One of them was soluble and showed affinity to the 3.4-dihy-droxybenzoic acid, while the second was concentrated in the microsomal fraction, recognizing the _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid as substrate and was inducible by glucose. The SDS PAGE and 2-DE analysis indicated the concentration of spots between pl 6-7 and 56-58 kDa in the microsomal fraction, which is in agreement with previous reports for geranyltransferases from plants (Fig. 6).\n\nThe two enzymatically formed products were characterized as _O_-geranylated derivatives and were previously reported as synthetic compounds (Kubo et al., 2003). The production of esters instead of ethers or C-prenylated derivatives, as naturally occurs in plants, suggests that different conditions and environments could affect the prenylation outcome in crude and partly purified enzymatic extracts. Besides, a C-geranylated derivative of the 3.4-dihy-droxybenzoic acid bearing a carbonyl group at C-5' could be proposed by the analysis of its MS-MS fragmentation data.

The inhibition of viral proteases has indeed been demonstrated to be a good target to search new drugs for the treatment of several illnesses including AIDS. In this context, the investigation on some common proteases such as subtilisin and pepsin is considered as a useful screening for the discovery of potential inhibitors of retroviral proteases (Hirata et al., 2005). Compounds **3** and **6** were tested as inhibitors of subtilisin and pepsin using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology. Both compounds showed weak activity, being the ester **6** slightly more active than **3** showing 15% of inhibition at 1 mg/ml on pepsin and 14% on subtilisin (Table 3). Warfarin and dicomumoral were tested as positive controls. The HIV-like protease inhibitory potential reported for **3** and **6** is the first approach to the determination of antiviral activity of this kind of compounds, and complements the range of biological activities previously reported, such as antifungal and antibacterial (Kubo et al., 2003; Nihei et al., 2004).\n\n## 4 Conclusions\n\nPrenylation of aromatic compounds represents an important feature when the formation of bioactive compounds in plants is concerned. There are several examples in which different simple prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl, geranylgeranyl or polytergenic unities are added to aromatic substrates rendering them with important biological properties. The literature survey indicated that among Piperaceae family, _P. crassinervium_ species appeared as an important source of geranyltransferase activity looking at biotransformations reactions. Between the two substrates evaluated, the p-hydroxybenzoic acid was O-geranylated, whilst the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was both C- and O-geranylated. The 0-geranylated products presented a weak protease inhibitory activity. The electrophoretic analysis performed on the microsomal fraction showed a typical prenyltransferase electrophoretic profile (Mr 56-58 kDa, pl 6-7).\n\nThis work contributes to the comprehensive study of biotransformation reactions with geranyl moieties using plant enzymatic extracts as an alternative strategy to the biocatalysis with purified enzymes.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Prof. Wagner Vilegas and Dr. Alberto C.

Eleven acidonic alkaloids were isolated from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. (Rutaceae), with eight of them being identified as potent and reversible inhibitors of cathepsin V (IC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 3.9 mM). Detailed mechanistic characterization of the effects of these compounds on the cathepsin V-catalyzed reaction showed clear competitive inhibition with respect to substrate, with dissociation constants (_K_i) in the low micromolar range (2, _K_i = 1.2 mM; **6**, _K_i = 1.0 mM; 7, _K_i = 0.2 mM; and **11**, _K_i = 1.7 mM). Molecular modeling studies provided important insight into the structural basis for binding affinity and enzyme inhibition. Experimental and computational approaches, including biological evaluation, mode of action assessment and modeling studies were successfully employed in the discovery of a small series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as competitive inhibitors of catV. The most potent inhibitor (**7**) has a _K_i value of 200 nM.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCathepsin, also known as lysosomal cysteine peptidases, are members of the papain-like peptidase family, which are implicated in many pathological conditions. These enzymes have been intensively studied as valuable targets for drug discovery and development.1,2 Although the major role of cathepsins is related to the terminal protein degradation in lysosomes, it has been shown that these enzymes are also involved in other relevant biochemical pathways, acting at selective and controlled processes with specific functions associated to their restricted tissue localization.3 In addition, evidence has indicated that cysteine cathepsins have specific intra- and extracellular functions, being involved in a number of diseases including cancer, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, autoimmune disorders, and viral infections.4\n\nCathepsin V (CatV, EC 3.4.22.43) was identified as a lysosomal cysteine protease specifically expressed in thymus, testis and corneal epithelium.5,7 The in vivo role of cathepsin V has been associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation pathway in humans8 and, in pathological conditions, the enzyme has been considered as a potential diagnostic marker for colon tumors.6 The enzyme is also expressed in colorectal and breast carcinomas but not in normal colon or mammary tissue. It is believed that cathepsin V plays a role in cancer progression, thus becoming a valuable drug target for oncology.9 Moreover, cathepsin V has been identified as having potent elastolytic activity expressed in activated macrophages and, together with the lysosomal cathepsins L, K, and S, has been implicated in atherosclerosis.10,11 Significant progress has been made to elucidate the relationship between cysteine cathepsins and several pathological states. For instance, cathepsins K and S have been validated as drug targets for the treatment of osteoporosis and immune disorders, respectively.4\n\nNatural products have provided considerable value to the pharmaceutical industry over the past century. Natural products represent a rich source of structural diversity and biological activities, providing many drugs and lead compounds for the treatment of a variety of human diseases successfully developed for the treat of human diseases in many therapeutic areas.12\n\nSeveral natural products have been investigated for their inhibitory effects on the catalytic activity of cathepsins.4,13-15 Acridone alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring nitrogen heterocyclic compounds that have shown a large spectrum of biological activities, including antiparasitic.16,17-18 antiviral,19 and cytotoxic.18,20-22 In the present work we described the biological evaluation and type of inhibition studies for a series of acridone alkaloids as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. Molecular modeling and preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were also performed to investigate the molecular basis underlying the binding affinity and inhibitory potency of this series of naturally occurring compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example\n\n## Page 2\n\nof the use of natural products as reversible and competitive inhibitors of CatV.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Chemistry\n\nThe acridone alkaloids 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10_H_)-one (**1**), 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10_H_)-one (**1**), 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone (**2**), glycocitrine-IV (**3**), glycocitrine-I (**4**), citrinsuinine-Il (**5**), citrinsuin-l (**6**), citrissine (**7**), 5-hydroxynoracroxyncine (**8**), pyranofoline (**9**), 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxy-propan-2-yl)-11-methoxy-10-methylfur(3,2-bacridin-5(10_H_)-one (**10**), and 3,4-dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl-2_H_-pyrano[2,3-a]-acridin-12(7_H_)-one (**11**) were isolated and identified from the methanol extract of the stem bark of Swingela glutinosa (Rutaceae) by chromatographic and spectral methods (Table 1).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Compound & R1 & R2 & R3 & R4 & IC50 (μM) & K (μM) \\\\\n**1** & & & OH & OCH3 & & 2.5 ± 0.2 & 0.5 \\\\\n**2** & & & OH & H & & 3.9 ± 0.9 & 1.2 \\\\\n**3** &\n\n## Page 3\n\nDetailed information on the isolation and characterization of the alkaloids can be obtained elsewhere.18\n\n### Expression and purification of cathepsin V\n\nRecombinant human cathepsin V was produced using the _Pichia pastoris_ expression system as previously described.7 The molar concentration of the enzyme was determined by active site titration with E-64 following the conditions previously described.23\n\n### Kinetic measurements\n\nAll commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma and used without further purification. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and diluted to the appropriate concentration prior to the assays. The inhibitors were screened against cathepsin V at an initial concentration of 25 mM. The in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates) as previously described.24 The final volume of the reaction mixture was 200 mL kept under stirring. Each well contained 191 mL of a 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM dithiothreitol (UTE), 2 mL of 1 mM Z-Phe-Arg-MCA dissolved in DMSO, 5 mL of sample, and 32 nM of cathepsin V. The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE at 27 degC, and then the reaction mixture was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The reactions were started by the addition of the fluorogenic substrate 4-methyl-corumary-7-amide (MCA) and measurements were conduct using the Molecular Devices Spectra MAX GEMINI XS (excitation 355 nm, and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). The IC50 values were independently determined by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentrations. The type of inhibition and _K_i values were determined under the same experimental conditions for three different inhibitor concentrations at five varying substrate concentrations (6.4, 9.6, 13, 19, and 38 mM). All kinetic parameters were determined from the collected data by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. The values represent means+-SD of at least three individual experiments.\n\n### Molecular modeling\n\nThe X-ray crystallographic data for catV in complex with APC-3316 (an irreversible vinyl sulfone inhibitor) used in docking simulations were retrieved from PDB (PDB ID, 1FH0). For the calculations, hydrogen atoms were added in standard geometry, using the Biopolymer module as implemented in the SYBR. 8.0 package (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux workstations. The only exception was the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys25), which was deprotonated during docking simulations. The histidine, glutamine, and asparagine residues in the active binding site were manually checked for possible flipped orientation, protonation, and tautomeric states with the Pymol 0.99 (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA) side-chain wizard script. The active site was defined incorporating all amino acid residues within a radius sphere of 6.0 A centered on the bound ligand. Molecular modeling studies were carried out using the default parameters of FlexX (BioSolveIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany).25 The FlexX scoring function was employed to select the representative pose for each compound of this series. Subsequently, the top-ranked conformations for each compound were submitted to the web-based interface DrugScoreONINE to rescore the proposed binding mode.26,27 Finally, the individual ranks obtained from the consensus scoring were considered to establish a new rank order list where the top-ranked inhibitor were selected for visual inspection.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Biochemical evaluation and preliminary SAR studies\n\nAs part of our ongoing research program aimed at discovering natural products as new potent inhibitors of cathepsin K, V, L, and S, we have screened a collection of 270 compounds, from which 111 were natural products isolated from Brazilian plants. The major classes evaluated in this study included cumarins, triterpenes, cinnamic acids, amides, lignans, flavonoids, alkaloids, and limonoids.\n\nThe percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation:\n\n\\[\\%\\ \\text{inhibition} = 100 \\times (1 - V_{\\text{i}}/V_{0} )\\]\n\nwhere _V_i and \\(V\\)0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determinate in presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively.\n\nAmong the compounds tested, the most promising results against the cathepsins were obtained for the alkaloid and flavonoid derivatives, including a series of acridone alkaloids (**1**-**11**), which showed potent inhibitory activity against cathepsin V. The chemical structures and corresponding IC50 values (concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V) for the set of compounds (**1**-**11**) are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, compound **7** is the most potent inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 1.2 mM. This is a valuable result since acridone alkaloids as catV inhibitors have not been described in the literature. In addition to compound **7**, compounds **1**-**3**, **6**, **10**, and **11** also showed substantial inhibition with IC50 values in the range of 2.2-5.2 mM. Compounds **4** and **5** showed only moderate inhibition, with IC50 values of 25 and 10 mM, respectively. The isomeric tetracyclic system (compounds **8** and **9**) also showed low inhibitory potency, with IC50 values of 48 and 44 mM, respectively. The most potent inhibitors of the series (**2**, **4**-**7**, **10**, and **11**) were then selected for further kinetic studies for determination of the type of inhibition and dissociation constants (_K_i).\n\n### Mechanism of inhibition\n\nIn order to explore the mechanism of inhibition in more detail, we have determined _K_i values (Table 1) and the type of inhibition with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA employing compounds **2**, **4**-**7**, **10**, and **11**. The results indicate that the inhibition of catV was found to be competitive with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (Fig. 1). The Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots show intercepts of all lines (obtained at three different inhibitor concentrations) converging at the _y_-axis (1/Vmax), whereas the slope (_K_M/Vmax) and _x_-axis intercepts (1/_K_M) vary with inhibitor concentration. Consequently, the _V_max values remain constant, whereas the apparent values of _K_M (\\(K_{\\text{M}}^{\\text{app}}\\), defined as _K_M(1 + [1]/_K_i)) increase with increasing inhibitor concentrations. This behavior is consistent with a mutually exclusive binding mode between inhibitor and substrate, therefore, these inhibitors (**2**, **4**-**7**, **10**, and **11**) compete with Z-Phe-Arg-MCA for the free enzyme active site. Another factor that must be considered in inhibitor drug design is the comparisons on the rational basis of the enzyme dissociation constant (_K_i), since IC50 values can vary with substrate concentration for competitive inhibitors. The same data of Figure 1 was employed to determine the _K_i values of the competitive inhibitors using Dixon plots, which consist in plotting the reciprocal of the initial velocity (1/_V_0) versus a series of inhibitor concentrations at constant substrate concentrations, where the \n\n## Page 4\n\nlines converge above the _x_-axis, indicating the inhibition constant \\(-K_{\\text{i}}\\). The \\(K_{\\text{i}}\\) values for inhibitors **2**, **4**-**7**, **10**, and **11** are listed in Table 1. Accordingly, the results confirm the acridone alkaloid derivatives as a new class of competitive inhibitors of catV, with affinity values in the low micromolar range.\n\n### Molecular modeling studies\n\nThe integration of experimental and computational approaches has become a vital component of structure- and ligand-based approaches.28-31 Despite the strong evidence that the acridone alkaloids bind to the active site of the enzyme, the kinetic data does not provide insights into the binding profile of the inhibitors (in the substrate pocket of catV). Therefore, molecular modeling studies were carried out to complement the kinetic findings and to investigate the mode of interaction of these inhibitors.30,31 To achieve this, the compounds of this series were docked into the active site of catV. Although a quantitative agreement between the model and experimental SAR data was not expected, the model provided relevant insights into the inhibitory activity of the acridone alkaloid derivatives. The best predicted orientation of the representative inhibitor of this series, compound **7** (\\(K_{\\text{i}} = 200\\) nM), within the catV binding pocket is depicted in Figure 2. It can be seen that the inhibitor binds to the central region of the catV substrate binding site, close to the catalytic residues Cys25 and His159. The inhibitor interacts to the enzyme through a set of four hydrogen bonds: (i) the 1-hydroxyl substituent is positioned at the S1 pocket as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly23; (ii) the oxygen atom of the 2-methoxy substituent accepts a hydrogen bond from the NH2 side-chain of Gln19, which is part of the oxyanion hole in catV;10 (iii) the 5-hydroxyl substituent binds to the S2 pocket acting as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Leu157; and (iv) the 9-carbonyl group binds to the S3 pocket by accepting a hydrogen bond from the NH main-chain of Gly66. In addition to the polar contacts, non-polar interactions contribute to the orientation of **7** in the catV binding site. The 1-hydroxyl and 2,3,4-trimmethoxy substituted rings form van der Waals contacts with the side-chains of Phe67 and Cys25, respectively. These findings are in agreement with our SAR data, which indicated that the presence of polar substituents at R(2-position) and less bulky groups at R(4-position) are favorable for enhanced inhibitory activity. Moreover, this conformation also suggests a structural feature that might be involved in the preferential binding of the 2-methoxy derivatives at R(**7**) compared with the corresponding isoprenoid (**1**-**3**) or unsubstituted derivatives (**4**-**6**; **8**-**10**). According to the model, the Gln19 residue would represent a hydrogen-bonding site to interact with the inhibitor in order to incorporate selected molecules inside the binding cavity of the enzyme, thereby contributing to the improved affinity of the inhibitor **7**. This observation is supported by the finding that the S1' would play a major role in the design of inhibitors having improved potency and affinity.10\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we described a new series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as potent inhibitors of the enzyme catV. The kinetic and type of inhibition studies revealed that the compounds of this class are reversible competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme with affinity in the low micromolar range. The SAR and molecular modeling investigations indicated important molecular and structural features underlying the inhibitory activity of this series.

The recovery of compounds **1-6** was determined by comparison with LC-atmosphere pressure chemical ionization MS/MS data: 662.52, 93.1%, 102.5%, 301.2%, 59.0% and 84.9%, respectively. Compound **3** showed IC50 of 23.6 mM against _Plasmodium falciparum_ and 15.6 mM against _Tympanosoma brucei rhodesines_ and was not toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 mM).\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nand _T. brucei rhodesiense_ [8]. These promising results have stimulated us to test some 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid derivatives for activity against these parasites. Preliminary assay was performed on methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), which showed activity against both _P. falciparum_ and _T. brucei rhodesiense_. However, compound **3** has been isolated from _Horia oreadia_ taprots in small amount, and then the MICs were not determined. Compounds **1-3** (Fig. 1) were isolated from _H. oreadia_ taprots [3,4].\n\nFurthermore, if it is assumed that it is possible to modify the chemical structure of compounds in order to improve activity and selectivity on the above assays, phytochemical studies of other organs of _H. oreadia_ deserve more attention. Thus, we have now examined the leaves of _H. oreadia_ since they have never been investigated before. The leaves afforded the known limonol guyanin (**1**), the alkaloids rutaeacripin (**2**) and dicramine (**6**), the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**), together with the new _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**) (Fig. 1).\n\nGenerally, the conventional methods including silica gel, polyamide and reversed-phase liquid chromatography are often used to isolate pure products from _H. oreadia_, but they are tedious, time consuming and usually require multiple chromatographic steps [9-11]. Counter-current chromatography (CCC), a liquid-liquid partition chromatography method, has a track record of being a powerful tool in the preliminary stages of crude extract fractionation [12-15]. With the ability to attain high resolution, modern CCC and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) instrumentation, such as HSCC and fast-centrifugal partition chromatography (FCP), have significant potential to develop new approaches in natural product drug discovery, specifically towards reducing the expensive and time-consuming steps to isolate active constituents. Due to the lack of a solid stationary phase, CCC has no irreversible adsorption and, therefore, provides loss-less fractionation [16]. Since samples are simply partitioned between different solvents phases, there is 100% theoretical sample recovery. In crude plant extract fractionation this is particularly valuable because it minimizes the chances of losing the activity during fractionation. This benefit of CCC allows researchers to address the issues of synergy between compounds to explain biological activity in plants, without the need to address potential irreversible adsorption of active constituents to the solid stationary phase during fractionation [14,17]. Therefore, HSCC was used for separation and purification of compounds **1-6** from dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. oreadia_.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Apparatus\n\nThe HSCC instrument employed in the present study was manufactured by P.C. Inc., Potomac, MD 20854, USA. It contained a quadruple multilayer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The \\(b\\) value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (_b_ = _r_/_R_, where \\(r\\) is the distance from the coil to the holder, and \\(R\\), the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis and the central shaft). The sample injection loop volume was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus was regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The flow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, NY, USA) constant-flow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector (Eyela, DC-1200); Liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS/MS) data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography equipped with a PDA2996 photodiode array detection (DAD) system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a _Z_-Spray API ion source and a megaflow electrospray probe; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): on a Bruker DXB 400 and 100 MHz with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard; infrared (IR): Bomen-FT-IR; ultraviolet (UV): Varian 500 Scan UV-Vis (visible)-NIR (near infrared); gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS): low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument. For low-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (APCI-MS), a Micromass Quattro LC instrument was used, equipped with a \"Z-spray\" ion source.\n\n### Reagents\n\nAll organic solvents used for HSCC were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and for LC-APCI-MS/MS were HPLC grade purchased from J.T. Baker (Ecatepec, Mexico).Water purified (18 M<OMEGA>) by a reverse osmosis Milli\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structures of compounds from _H. oreadia_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nQ system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for all solutions and dilutions.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe leaves of _H. oreadia_ were collected in January 2001 in Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. The identification was carried out by Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, Sao Paulo University and vouchers are deposited in the Herbarium of the same department.\n\n### Preparation of crude sample\n\nThe leaves (3.2 kg) of _H. oreadia_ were dried carefully by forced air at 40 degC and reduced to powder. The powdered dried leaves were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH at room temperature three times. After the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (93.0 g), dichloromethane (161.0 g) and methanol (42.0 g).\n\n### Selection of two-phase solvent system\n\nSmall amounts of dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. oreadia_ were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the compounds allowed to partition between the two phases [18,19]. The distribution of the components between both phases of each the 5 solvents systems were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using 20 cm x 20 cm silica gel plates with a thickness of 0.20 mm (silica gel 60 F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), on which the crude extract was horizontally spotted. The solvent system used for the development of the TLC plates was hexane-ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v). The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with a solution of vanillin reagent (5 g of vanillin in 9 mL of methanol, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 and 3 drops of acetic acid) followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of compounds into each phase. The partition coefficients were determined by GC-MS only for the best solvent system as follows: 0.5 mg of dichloromethane extract was added to a test tube, to which 5 mL of each phase of the two-phase solvent system was added. The test tube was shaken as above, and then the upper and lower phases were analyzed by GC-MS. The partition coefficients of three compounds in sample were determined according to the peak areas.\n\n### Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution\n\nThe two-phase solvent system composed of hexane-ethanol-acetonitrile-water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separatory funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The upper phase and the lower phase were separated and degassed by sonication for 20 min shortly before use.\n\nSample solutions were prepared by dissolving the dichloromethane extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v).\n\n### GC-MS analysis\n\nThe partition coefficient and HSCCC fractions were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph fitted with a fused silica DB-5 (30 m x 0.32 mm LD, 0.25 mm film thickness) capillary column with helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. The temperature was programmed initially at 100 degC for 1 min, and then increased with a rate of 10 degC min-1 to 250 degC, the latter maintained for 30 min. The injection (1 mL) was split and its temperature was 280 degC. The interface temperature was 250 degC. The chromatograph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass-selective detector at 70 eV.\n\n### HSCCC separation\n\nThe upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elution mode. First, the coiled column was entirely filled with the stationary phase (lower phase). Then the apparatus was rotated forward at 800 rpm, while the mobile phase (upper phase) was pumped into the column in a tail to head direction at a flow rate of 3.0 mL min-1. The retention of stationary phase (_SF_) was 85% (_SF_ = 0.85). After the mobile phase front emerged and the hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution containing 2.5 g of the dichloromethane extract was injected through the injection module at a flow rate of 3.0 mL min-1. A total of 34 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an automated fraction collector. However, with 24 fractions all compounds obtained have already eluted.\n\n### TLC analysis of fractions obtained by HSCCC\n\nAll HSCCC fractions collected were monitored by TLC (20 cm x 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254) with hexane-ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v) as the developing solvent. Based on the TLC plates monitoring, all HSCC fractions were combined into 8 analytically distinct fractions. Fractions 1-2 afforded 5.8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**, 0.240 g), fraction 3 furnished _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**, 0.045 g) and fraction 5 yielded methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), (0.148 g). Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with _n_-hexane-Me2CO (8:2) affording guyanin (**1**, 0.04 g). Fraction 6 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:4) to give rutaceargin (**2**, 0.11 g). Fractions 7-8 were purified as fraction 6 to yield dictannine (**6**, 0.088 g).\n\n### LC-APCI-MS/MS\n\nLC-APCI-MS/MS data were acquired using a 3.0 mm x 30 mm, 3.5 mm XTerra-MS C-18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively, each one supplemented with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, TFA): 20% line B at the beginning then goes to 30% B and 30% C in 9 min; the column was then washed with 20% line B and 80% line C for 4 min and re-conditioned with 20% line B for 3 min; a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1 was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210-500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post UV-detector splitter was used to send only 0.3 mL min-1 to the ion source; nitrogen was used for nebulization (200 L h-1) and desolvation (785 L h-1); the corona discharge was set at 3.27 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 27 and 4 V respectively; argon (Ar) was used for the fragmentation experiments and the parent ions were accelerated using a collision energy ramp of 1-25 eV. For SRM experiments, the cone voltage was maintained using tune parameters previously optimized for all compounds at 27 V, and two transitions were selected for each compound (Fig. 2): for **1**, _m/z_ 499 - 397 (monitoring) and _m/z_ 499 - 343 (quantification), using a collision energy (CE) of 20 eV; for compound \\(2\\), _m/z_ 288 - 244 (quantification) and _m/z_ 288 - 169 (monitoring) (CE 25 eV); for compound **3**_m/z_ 307 - 203 (monitoring) and _m/z_ 307 - 233 (quantification) (CE = 25 eV); for compound **4**_m/z_ 293 - 201 (monitoring) and _m/z_ 293 - 233 (quantification) (CE = 25 eV); for compound **5**_m/z_\n\n## Page 4\n\n313 \\(\\to\\) 251, 313 \\(\\to\\) 176, 313 \\(\\to\\) 151 (monitoring) and \\(m/z\\) 313 \\(\\to\\) 297 (quantification) (CE = 25 eV); for compound **6** \\(m/z\\) 200 \\(\\to\\) 129 (monitoring) and \\(m/z\\) 200 \\(\\to\\) 185 (quantification) (CE = 20 eV). The dwell time was 0.08 s, and the interscan delay was 0.1 s. The collision gas pressure (argon) was set at 1.35e\\(-\\)3 mbar for all experiments.\n\n#### Software\n\nAll MS data were acquired and processed using MassJynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, UK).\n\n#### Calibration standard and analytical curves\n\nStock solutions (1000 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\)) of compounds **1-6** were prepared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, HPLC grade, Eatepec, Mexico). Working solutions were prepared at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) by diluting stock solutions. Calibration standards curves were obtained in triplicates. For each point of the analytical curves, the worst value in comparison with the average was discarded. Calibration curves were obtained plotting concentration (\\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\)) in axis \\(x\\) per area below SRM peaks (arbitrary units) in axis \\(y\\) (average of three runs).\n\n#### Sample preparation\n\nThe dichloromethane extract (30 mg) was re-suspended in 3.0 mL of HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) in centrifuge tubes by vortex agitation (Phoenix AP56, Araraquara, SP Brazil) for 30 s at the maximum possible speed. The obtained solution was filtered (PTFE Millipore, 53a Paulo, Brazil, d. 25.0 mm and p. 0.20 \\(\\mu\\)m), and then diluted appropriately and used for quantification of compounds **1-6** by LC-APCI-MS/MS.\n\n### Biological assays\n\nStock solutions of the compounds, plus control drugs, were prepared at a concentration of 20 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, UK), and diluted to appropriate concentration prior to assays. IC50 values were calculated with MSXLFT (IDBS, UK).\n\n#### P. falciparum\n\nChloroquine-sensitive _P. falciparum_ strain 3D7 was maintained in human A+ erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, UK) supplemented with Albumax II at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. _P. falciparum_ intraerythrocytic cultures were set up as above, with 1% ring stage parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit, in triplicate in 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of medium in 96 well, flat-bottomed Microtest III tissue plates. Drugs were added in threefold dilution series and cultures incubated for a total of 48 h at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. After 24 h, (3H) hypoxanthine (0.2 mCi) was added to each well. At the end of the assay, plates were rapidly freezetwahed, harvested using a Tomtec Mach III cell harvested (Tomtec, CT) onto a 96-well format filtermat and Meltilex solid scintillant (both Wallac, Finland) added prior to reading in a Microbeta 1450 scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland) at 1 min per well.\n\n#### T. brucei rhodiesense\n\n_T. brucei rhodiesense_ STIB900 blood stream form trypanastigotes were maintained in HMI-18 medium, with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HarlanSeralLab, UK) at 37degC in 5% CO2-air mixture. Prior to drugging, trypanastigotes were washed and re-suspended in fresh medium at a concentration 2 x 105 mL\\({}^{- 1}\\), and 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of this suspension was added to the drug dilutions. The top concentration for the test compounds was 30 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\). Pentamidine was included as the standard drug. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4-5 h on Gemini fluorescent plate reader (Sofimax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a filter cut-off at 550 nm.\n\n#### Cytotoxicity assays\n\n96-well plates were seeded with KB cells at a concentration of 2 x 104 mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) (100 \\(\\mu\\)L per well). Drugs at 300, 30, 3 and 0.3 \\(\\mu\\)g mL\\({}^{- 1}\\) were added in fresh overlay after 24 h, in triplicate at each concentration. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37degC in a 5% CO2-air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4-5 h on Gemini fluorescent plate reader (Sofimax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a filter cut-off at 550 nm. IC50 values were calculated against the blanks\n\nFig. 2: Second-generation ion product spectra obtained under CID-MS/MS: Compounds **1** (20 eV); **2** (25 eV); **3** (25 eV); **4** (25 eV); **5** (25 eV); **6** (250 eV).

The content of compounds in the crude extracts is important to determine their recovery in HSCC analyses. The mobile phase was determined after testing different compositions of solvents. A good chromatographic resolution was achieved using a 9 min gradient, beginning with 20% acetonitrile then going to 30% acetonitrile and 30% methanol. This mobile phase provided both excellent separation between all six compounds and good ionization levels under the APCI ion source. The SRM transitions were chosen on the basis of the stability of products obtained under collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS. The second-generation product ion spectra of compounds **1-6** showed intense protonated molecules ([M + H+]) at _m/z_ 499, 288, 307, 293, 313 (_m/z_ 313 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the protonated molecular ion _m/z_ 359), and 200 respectively. The product ions chosen to form the transitions in SRM mode during the development and application of the method provided an excellent specificity to the method, as shown by the SRM chromatograms (Fig. 3) and second-generation ion product spectra obtained under CID-MS/MS (Fig. 2). Regression analysis of the least-square line for data acquired from the external standard calibration curves showed good linearity at a 0.01-1.0 mg mL-1 concentration range of six compounds, with a correlation coefficient above 0.997 for all curves. The content of guyanin (**1**), rutaeacrpin (**2**), methyl 5.7-dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**), 5.8-dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**), _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**), and dictamarine (**6**) in the crude extract were 2.42%, 4.80%, 5.78%, 9.82%, 1.80%, 4.15%, respectively, and showed RSD ranging from 0.03 to 2.11%, as determined by HPLC-APCI-MS/MS (Table 1).\n\n### CCC solvent system\n\nThe essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvents. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. However, this is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent. For efficient separation, it is important that the partition coefficient (_K_) of the target compounds should lie in the range 0.5 < \\(K\\) < 2.0, and the separation factor between any two components (\\(\\alpha = k2/k1\\), \\(k\\)2 > \\(k\\)1) should be greater than 1.5. A smaller \\(K\\) value results in a loss of peak resolution, while a larger value produces excessive band broadening. To ensure a satisfactory retention of the stationary phase, the settling time of the solvent system should be shorter than 30 s. In order to avoid wastage of solvent, it is recommended that the two-phase system under consideration produces similar volumes of each phase [20]. It is also essential to consult solvent systems used in countercurrent chromatography that can be found in the specialised literature, e.g. [18,21,22,23].\n\nVarious techniques can be used for analysis of the best solvent system. Thin-layer chromatography is a very rapid way of guiding method development. A small amount of the sample is thoroughly mixed in a vial with equal volumes of the upper and lower phases of the chosen solvent system. The same volume of each phase is applied to a TLC plate which is then allowed to migrate in the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Compounds & Content in the crude extract (\\%) & Yielded by HSCC (g) & HSCC recovery (\\%) \\\\ LC–APCI-MS/MS & & & \\\\\n1 & 2.42 ± 0.03 & 0.040 & 66.2 \\\\\n2 & 4.80 ± 2.11 & 0.110 & 93.1 \\\\\n3 & 5.78 ± 0.05 & 0.148 & 102.5 \\\\\n4 & 9.82 ± 1.42 & 0.240 & 101.2 \\\\\n5 & 1.80 ± 0.18 & 0.045 & 99.0 \\\\\n6 & 4.15 ± 0.53 & 0.088 & 84.9 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Concentration of compounds **1–6** quantified simultaneously by LC–APCI-MS/MS in dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. orendica_.\n\nFigure 3: SRM chromatograms obtained during the quantification of compounds **1–6** on dichloromethane extract from leaves of _H. orendica_.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\norganic phase of the two-phase solvent system. An optimal system gives an equal distribution between the two phases and Rf values of the sample components between 0.2 and 0.5. If the sample is found almost exclusively in one phase, the solvent system is obviously of no use. It should be noted that the Rf value gives only an approximate indication of the appropriateness of a particular solvent because TLC involves both partition and adsorption mechanisms, whereas CCC is based on purely liquid-liquid partition phenomena [20].\n\nThe following polar two-phase solvent systems were tested: chloroform-methanol-water (5:4:3, v/v), dichloromethane-methanol-water (4:5:3, v/v), hexane-ethanol-acetonitrile-water (10:8:1:1, v/v), hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (3:7:5:5, v/v), hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:1:1, v/v), hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (5:5:4:5, v/v), hexane-ethanol-methanol-water (10:7:10:8, v/v), hexane-ethanol-methanol-water (10:10:9:11, v/v), and hexane-chloroform-methanol-water (3:6:3:2, v/v). Out of the 9 candidate biphasic solvent systems, 4 were rejected, as the settling times were either too long, emulsions were formed when extract was added, or suitable partitioning did not occur. The remaining 5 solvent systems gave reasonable separation on TLC, however, only hexane-ethanol-acetonitrile-water (10:8:1:1, v/v) showed similar distribution among the two phases with the Rf values approximately 0.3 between the components, and therefore it was used for the CCC separation. The partition coefficients determined by GC-MS with this solvent system for compounds **3-5** obtained in one-step separation were 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1, respectively. 5.8-Dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**) was obtained in a pure form at tubes 1-11, _E_-3-4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**) at tubes 12-14, and methyl 5.7-dimethoxy-2.2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propionate (**3**) at tubes 20-22. The GC-MS of these compounds was shown in Fig. 4. The recovery of compounds **3-5** of 2.5 g of crude extract in a one-step separation were 102.5%, 101.2%, 99.0% (Table 1), respectively, which were determined by comparison with HPLC-APCI-MS/MS data. Guyanin (**1**) was obtained after column chromatography on silica gel, rutae-carpin (**2**) and dictamine (**6**) on Sephadex LH-20, however, their recoveries were also excellent 66.2%, 93.1% and 84.9% (Table 1), respectively.\n\n### The structural identification of the compounds\n\nThe structures of isolated compounds were identified on the basis of spectral data, particularly 1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, and APCI-MS/MS, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those from the literature. Compounds **1** and **2** have previously been isolated from _Hortica regia_ [24], **3** and **4** from _H. colombiana_ [25] and dictamine (**6**) from _H. longifolia_ [26] (Fig. 1).\n\nThe new compound _E_-3.4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbo methoxyphenyl) cinnamic acid was identified as **5** (Fig. 1) on the basis of the following data: Amorphous white solid. UV _l_max/nm (CHCl3) 215, 200, 24; IR _v_max/cm-1 (lio, film) 3019, 2927, 2854 (CH), 1734 (carboxyl group), 1738 (ester), 1626; 1518, 1464, 1441, 1379, 1262, 1215, 756, 669. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 722 (1H, \\(d\\), _H_-2, _J_=2.0 Hz)\n\n## Page 7\n\nacid with the selective action on the parasites, and **3** was not toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 mM). The 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acids represent a novel class of compounds tested for the first time as antimalarial and trypanediol agents. Unfortunately, the other compounds showed no appreciable activity against _P. falciparum_ and _T. brucei_ rhodesines (IC50 > 100 mM). Activity appears to be associated with a methyl ester function, since _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid **5** and 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid **4** were inactive against both protozoan. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, derivatives **4** and **5** will be converted in methyl ester and assayed again.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCompounds 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (**4**). _E_-3,4-dimethoxy-a(3-hydroxy-4-carbonate hoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (**5**) and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (**3**) were obtained in one-step HSCCC separation. The one-step separation was more rapid (1 h and 20 min) and less solvents consuming, while conventional methods of CC for separation of guyanin (**1**), rutacargin (**2**) and dictamine (**6**) from HSCCC fraction 4, 6 and 7-8 (respectively) were rather time consuming. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel and compound **1** was obtained with more working time (12 h). Fractions 6 and 7-8 were applied to Sephadex LH-20 ant took less working time (4 h). The present LC-APCII-MS/MS method was successfully applied to the quantification of all six compounds from the crude extracts, and permitted to determine the recovery of compounds **1-6** in HSCCC analyses, which were excellent. The present study proved that HSCCC is a powerful technique for the isolation in one-step of compounds **3-5** from plant crude extracts for bioactivity studies.\n\nThe biological result indicated that the compound tested was active at concentrations in the micromolar range, while the controls chloroquine (IC50 3.0 nM, _P. falciparum_) and pentamidine (IC50 35 nM, _T. brucei_) were active in the nanomolar range under the same test conditions. However, if it is assumed that the IC50 required for continued investigation is <30 mM, the IC50 of compound **3** is meaningful.\n\nChemical transformation of the limonoid guyanin (**1**, 40 mg) and alkaloid rutacargin (**2**, 110 mg) is in progress and perhaps could improve their antibacterial activity against _X. fastidiosa_.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES), for the financial support.\n\n## References\n\n* (1) P.G.

A two-phase solvent system composed of hexane/ethano|acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for the high-speed counter-current chromatographic isolation of xanthyletin with high yield and over 99% purity as determined by liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection.

Every year a large number of coumarins, having varied substitution patterns, are isolated from nature [1]. Xanthyletin (**1**, Fig. 1) is a coumarin isolated from _Citrus_ species. Several biological activities, such as anti-tumor and anti-bacterial activities and inhibition of the symbiotic fungus cultivated by leaf-cutting ants [2; 3; 4] have been associated with this compound.\n\nLeaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores in the tropics, can be found from the Southern USA to Northern Argentina [5]. Leaf-cutting ants are known to be a serious pest for agriculture due to the high amounts of vegetal matter from crops used by them in order to cultivate a symbiotic fungus on which they rely for food and enzymes [6; 7]. The mutualism between the fungus and the ants is a point to be explored when alternative methods of control are being thought of. Several compounds have been used for the control of these ants as organophosphorus, pyrethroids and sulfuramid insecticides [3]. Consequently, an extensive search for alternate methods to control these insects has been made in an attempt to substitute traditional agrochemicals by high specificity and, therefore, causing less damage to the environment.\n\nThe preparative isolation and purification of xanthyletin from plant materials by conventional methods such as column chromatography has been reported previously [4]. But the method is tedious and requires multiple chromatography steps. The counter-current chromatography technique has been widely used today in the isolation of natural products, and it is a form of liquid-liquid partition without the use of adsorbents, using two or more immiscible liquids, which are the mobile phase and the other the stationary phase. It eliminates irreversible absorptive loss of samples onto the solid support matrix used in conventional chromatography. The technique allows complete recovery of the sample, and is suitable for separations in the gram range [8].\n\nThis study reports the isolation of xanthyletin using high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) for the first time. The optimum conditions were obtained for xanthyletin isolation with the purity at over 99%.\n\n## 2 Experimental\n\n### Apparatus\n\nThe HSCCC system employed in the present study was a P.C. Inc. (Potomac, MD, USA) instrument equipped with a quadruple multi-layer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The \\(\\beta\\) value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (\\(\\beta\\) = _r_/_R_, where \\(r\\) is the distance from the coil to the holder, and \\(R\\), the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis \n\n## Page 2\n\nand the central shaft). The loop volume of the sample injection was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus can be regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The flow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, New York, USA) constant-flow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector DC-1200 (Eyela, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\nGas chromatography and mass spectra (GC-MS) were performed in a Shimadzu GC-17A (Tokyo, Japan) instrument coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 (EIMS) system.\n\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were performed using two Shimadzu pumps (LC-10AD and LC-10 Advp) and an SPD-M10Avp UV detector set at 205 nm. HPLC-grade solvents were obtained from Mallinckrodt, and H2O was purified in a Milli-Q system. LC-UV-electrospray ionization (ESI) MS/MS data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography equipped with a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) PDA2996 photodiode array detection (DAD) system; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaflow electrospray probe.\n\nFor NMR, Bruker (Rheinstetten, Germany) DRX 400 and ARX 200 instruments were used; for UV a Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) 500 Scan UV-vis-near infrared (NIR) system and for IR a Bomen-FT/IR (Quebec, Canada) instrument.\n\n### Reagents and plant materials\n\nAll the solvents used for preparation of crude sample and HSCC separation were of analytical grade (Quimis) and the water used was distilled water. The root of Citrus sinensis grafted on _Citrus limonia_ were collected in Estacao Experimental de Citricultura do Instituto Agronomico de Campinas, Cordeiroopolis, Brazil.\n\n### Preparation of crude extract\n\nThe roots (467 g) of C. _sinensis_ grafted on _C. limonia_ were dried carefully by forced air at 40 degC and reduced to powder. The powdered dried root was extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH at room temperature for 3 times. After the evaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (5.7 g), dichloromethane (7.6 g) and methanol (17.6 g).\n\n### Selection of two-phase solvent system\n\nSmall amounts of crude extract of _C. sinensis_ grafted on _C. limonia_ were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the compounds allowed to partition between the two phases [9,10]. In order to determine partition coefficient value _K_' of approximately 1, the distribution of the components between both phases of 11 solvents system tested was determined by silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (20 cm x 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254mm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as the eluting solvent. The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with solution acid of vanillin followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of the xanthyletin.\n\n### Choice of the mobile phase\n\nIn the choice of the mobile phase, small amounts of crude extract of _C. sinensis_ grafted on _C. limonia_ were applied on silica gel TLC and it was developed with the water-saturated organic layer (i.e., upper organic phase) as the eluting solvent.\n\n### Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution\n\nThe two-phase solvent system composed of hexane/ethanol/acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separator funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The two phases were separated and degassed by sonication prior to use.\n\nThe sample solution was prepared by dissolving the crude extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v) of the solvent system used for HSCC separation.\n\n### HSCC separation\n\nThe upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elution mode. In each separation, the multilayer-coiled column was first filled entirely with the stationary phase. The mobile phase was then pumped into the tail end of the inlet column at a flow rate of 3.0 mL/min, while the apparatus was rotated at 850 rpm. After the mobile phase front emerged and hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution containing 1.2 g of the crude extract was injected.\n\n### HPLC analysis and identification of HSCC peak fractions\n\nThe crude extract of _C. sinensis_ grafted on _C. limonia_ and each peak fraction from HSCC separation were analyzed by HPLC. Analysis of coumarins in the crude sample and each peak fraction from HSCC was performed on a C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm LD., 5 mm); flow rate 0.8 mL/min; detection wavelength, 220 and 270 nm. The mobile phase composed of MeOH:H2O (6:4) was eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and the effluent was monitored at 220 and 270 nm. The retention time was compared with that of standard of each coumarin. LC-UV-ESI-MS/MS data were obtained using a 250 mm x 4.60 mm. 5 mm Luma Plphenyl-Hexyl column (Phenomenex, CA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively): 40% line B at the beginning then goes to 50% B and 20% C in 10 min and stay so for 17 min; the column was then washed with 100% line C for 2 min and re-conditioned with 35 line B for 8 min; a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210-500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post column splitter was used to\n\nFig. 1: Structures of coumarins isolated from crude extract of the _Citrus sinensis_ grafted on _C. limonia_ roots: xanthyletin (**1**), suberosin (**2**), seselin (**3**) and xanthocyletin (**4**).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nsend only 0.25 mL/min to the ion source; Nitrogen was used for nebulization (50 L/h) and desolvation (630 L/h); the ESI capillary was set at 3.36 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 32 and 5 V respectively; Argon was used for the fragmentations experiments and the parent ions were accelerated using a collision energy ramp of 5-35 eV.\n\n### Analyses GC-MS\n\nGC-MS was performed in a 30 m x 0.2 mm DB-5 capillary column. The mass spectrometer was set to scan 40-650 m/z with an ionizing voltage at 70 eV. Samples were injected (1 mL) with a splitting ratio of 1:20 and the injector temperature was set to 250 degC. A continuous flow rate of 1 mL/min of chromatographic grade helium was used. The column oven was initially at 120 degC and was held for 1 min after injection, followed by temperature ramping at 10 degC/min up to 250 degC, hold for 10 min. The total run time was approximately 24 min.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Optimization of HSCCC conditions, choice of CCC solvent systems and mobile phase\n\nThe essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvent. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. Hence, it is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent [9,11-15]. Several techniques can be used to obtain the best solvent system and TLC is a very rapid way of guiding method development.\n\nThe polar two-phase solvent systems tested for HSCCC obtaining xanthyletin are presented in Table 1. Among those the hexane/ethanol/acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) gave the best partition coefficient value, as well as it presented no emulsion formation and the time for phase separation was short (Table 1) for crude extract and pure xanthyletin and therefore was used for the HSCCC separation. The choice of the mobile phase has been done by TLC. The rapid TLC method to choice of two-phase aqueous solvent systems is the most applicable to the separations of a given extract [12]. If the _R_F values of the compounds to be separated are higher than about 0.5 (less polar solutes (_R_F < 0.5) the more polar layer should be used as the mobile phase. However, the organic phase was used as mobile phase because _R_F values of the compounds to be separated are higher than about 0.5 and it facilitates the evaporation of solvent from the collected fractions.\n\nSeveral additional CCC optimization parameters were examined, i.e., number of columns, flow rates, volume of fractions collected, sample volume and mass injected and rotation speed. The number of columns had influenced on the separation and purity of the outcome sample. When the separation was conducted for four coumarins employing 2 and 3 columns, poor separation occurred. On the other hand, when 4 columns were used, good separation results and acceptable separation time could be obtained. Besides the recovered sample had higher purity for each coumarin studied. The best flow tested was 3 mL/min and 800 rpm.\n\n### Isolation of xanthyletin, suberosin, seselin and xanthoxyletin\n\nAtotal of 100 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an automated fraction collector. The collected fractions were monitored by TLC. The fractions 36-41, 47-53, 55-63, 71-94 contained, suberosin **2**, 30.8 mg, 93% purity), seselin (**3**, 17 mg, 86.9% purity), kanamycin/acetonitrile (**4**, 36.4 mg, 89.5% purity), and xanthyletin (**1**, 128.5 mg, 90% purity) respectively. The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. The difference between suberosin and the other coumarins is the existence of a dimethylallyl group in the molecule. This group confers lower polarity to the suberosin when compared with the other coumarins under study. As such, this compound is the first to be eluted in HSCCC analysis. The dimethylallyl group bonded to coumarin skeleton is able to cyclize with the phenol group, like the other coumarins, rendering them more planarity and with high interaction with aqueous phase. The structural difference between the seselin, xanthoxyletin and the xanthyletin is the presence of a methoxy group in the 5 position in xanthoxyletin of the angular or linear pyrane ring in seselin and xanthyletin, respectively. The lipophilicity of seselin and xanthoxyletin when compared with xanthyletin can be justified by the presence of the methoxy group and angular ring. These differences in lipophilicity are responsible for the observed compounds' elution.\n\n### HPLC and GC-MS analyses and identification of the coumarins in HSCC fractions\n\nFollowing preparative isolation and purification by HSCCC, the collected fractions were analyzed by TLC, GC-MS and HPLC-MS to determine the relative purities of each fraction. Fig. 2 presents HPLC chromatograms of crude extract of _C. sinensis_ grafted on _C. limonia_ and of xanthyletin, seselin and xanthoxyletin. Fig. 3A and B presents the mass and UV spectra of these compounds. Xanyl lutein was obtained with over 99% of purity after crystallization and 15.45 min retention time. The GC chromatography confirms this purity. Seselin and xanthoxyletin were obtained in 70% and 57%, respectively and their retention times were 15.9 and 16.6 min, respectively (Fig. 2). Suberosin was analyzed first by GC-MS and presented the purity of 93% (Fig. 4), but in the HPLC analysis (Fig. 5) it undergoes oxidation to a coumarin with 260 dalton. Further studies have to be done to determine the structure, mechanism and reason for this transformation to occur.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} Solvent systems & Emulsion formation & Time for phase separation (s) & Volume organic (ml) & Volume aqueous (ml) & Extract amount (mg) \\\\ \\hline  & – & – & – & – & & \\\\ Chloroform/methanol/water (5:4:3, v/v) & + & – & 25 & 15 & 5.1 & 6.9 & 5.5 \\\\ Dichloromethane/methanol/water (4:5:3, v/v) & + & – & 3400 & 15 & 4.0 & 8.0 & 5.0 \\\\ Hexane/acetonitrile/methanol (8:5.2, v/v) & – & – & 15 & 7 & 7.6 & 7.4 & 5.7 \\\\ Hexane/ethanol/water (6:5.5, v/v) & – & + & 1620 & 120 & 3.2 & 4.8 & 6.2 \\\\ Hexane/ethanol/acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) & – & 60 & 15 & 4.9 & 5.1 & 5.6 \\\\ Hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (1:1:1:1, v/v) & + & – & 24 h & 15 & 5.2 & 2.8 & 5.2 \\\\ Hexane/electr acetate/methanol/water (3:7:5:5, v/v) & – & 60 & 25 & 4.9 & 5.1 & 5.7 \\\\ Hexane/ethanol/methanol/water (10:10:8:1, v/v) & + & – & 120 & 40 & 11.9 & 5.1 & 5.8 \\\\ Hexane/methanol/water (10:10:9:1, v/v) & + & – & 420 & 50 & 3.0 & 7.0 & 5.7 \\\\ Hexane/methanol/water (6:5:5, v/v) & + & + & 300 & 120 & 3.3 & 4.7 & 5.6 \\\\ Hexane/chloroform/methanol/water (3:6:3:2, v/v) & + & – & 24 h & 25 & 9.0 & 5.0 & 6.8 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Solvent systems tested, emulsion formation, time for phase separation and phases volume for crude extract’ and xanthyletin” (1 mg).\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n### Identification of the coumarins\n\nThe identification and structural elucidation of the xanthyletin, seselin, suberosin and xanthoxyletin were performed with UV spectra, IV spectra, GC-MS and HPLC-MS (Figs. 2-4), 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopic methods and by comparison with literature data [16-20].\n\nXanthyletin (1): p.f.: 128-130 degC; UV \\(\\lambda_{\\rm max}\\) (CH2Cl2) 263, 279, 371 nm; IR \\(v_{\\rm max}\\) cm-1: 2967, 2929 (CH), 1719 (lactone), 1621, 1560, 1480, 1395, 1364, 1279, 1132. \\(\\beta\\)H (400 MHz, CDCl3) 1.43 (6H, s, 2 x CH3), 5.71 (1H, d, J 9.6 Hz), 6.24 (1H, d, J 9.2 Hz), 6.36 (1H, d, J 9.6 Hz), 6.72 (1H, s), 7.04 (1H, s), 7.60 (1H, d, J 9.2 Hz). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 161.1 (C-2), 131.2 (C-3), 143.3 (C-4), 112.7 (C-4a), 124.7 (C-5), 118.5 (C-6), 156.8 (C-7), 120.7 (C-8), 155.4 (C-8a),\n\nFig. 3: (A) UV spectra obtained for coumarins xanthyletin (1), seselin (3) and xanthoxyletin (4) by LC-DAD.

The gingerols purification was carried out in HPLC system using a Luna-C18 and the best mobile phase evaluated was MeOH/H2O (75:25, v/v). This new methodology for the gingerols isolation was very effective, since considerable amounts (in the range of milligrams) with a good purity degree (~98%) were achieved in 30 min of chromatographic run. [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol purified by this methodology inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of \\(666.2\\pm 134.6\\) uM, \\(135.6\\pm 22.6\\) uM and \\(12.1\\pm 0.3\\) uM, respectively. These substances also inhibited human fibroblasts (HF) cell proliferation, however in concentrations starting from 500 uM. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an optimization of gingerols isolation and their specific anti-proliferative activities against tumor cells, suggesting their use as important models for drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSeveral population-based studies indicate that people in Asian countries have a much lower risk of different cancer types such as colon, gastrointestinal, prostate and breast, when compared to their Western counterparts. It is widely claimed that constituents of their diet such as ginger, garlic, soy, curcumin, onion, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, chillies, and green tea contribute to that lower incidence [1]. Therefore, there is increasing interest in naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive agents.\n\nGinger (_Zingiber officinale_foccinekosce) is widely used worldwide as a food, space and herb [2], Together with [6]-gingerol, [8]- and [10]-gingerol are the major pungent constituents in the ginger oleoresin from fresh rhizome, being [6]-gingerol the most abundant. Gingerols comprise a series of homologue substances differentiated by the length of their alkyl chains with [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol having 10, 12 and 14 carbons in their unbranched alkyl chains, respectively [3].\n\nRegarding [6]-gingerol a variety of pharmacological characteristics was already described, including analgesic, antipyretic, cardiotonic, hypothermia inducing and cancer preventing effects [4, 5, 6]. However, the effects on tumor cell proliferation for [8]- and [10]-gingerol are still scarce.\n\nBreast cancer is the third most frequent cancer in the world and one of the most common malignant diseases in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the second highest cause of death in women after cervical cancer [7]. To treat breast and many other cancer types, chemotherapy is one of the most extensively studied methods. However, its efficacy and safety remain a primary concern as well as its toxicity and other side effects [8, 9]. Another reason for concern regarding this method is the development of chemotherapy resistance, which is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of many tumor types, including breast cancer [8]. Tumor cells are found to adopt multiple mechanisms to resist drugs, such as decreased uptake, and/or enhanced efflux and altered drug \n\n## Page 2\n\nmetabolism. Alteration in drug targets, activation of detoxification systems, enhanced DNA repair ability, and inhibition of apoptosis are also cancer cell strategies to resist against chemotherapy drugs [10].\n\nMany anticancer therapies can temporarily stop tumor growth; it means that, in most cases, the effect is not permanent. In this way, there is a significant need for new agents with low susceptibility to common drug resistance mechanisms in order to improve response rates and potentially prolong patient's survival. Approximately 30% of the women diagnosed with early-stage disease progress to metastatic breast cancer. To these women, therapeutic options are still limited. Current recommendations for first-line chemotherapy include anthracycline-based and taxanes treatments (paclitaxel and docetaxel) [8]. Taxanes - which are taxol derivatives that were first described as microtubule stabilizing agents [11] and then had their antineoplastic effects confirmed [12,13] - are the first example of natural product derivatives used in antitumor therapy. Therefore, the search for new natural products that may be used as an additional alternative to the chemotherapy in an attempt to develop more effective drugs with fewer side effects is of great interest [14]. Based on this assumption it is important to develop an effective method for the isolation of these compounds.\n\nThe aim of this work was to search a faster, efficient and productive procedure for isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol by reverse phase HPLC operating under overloading conditions and to test their anti-proliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumor line and normal human fibroblasts (HF), a non tumor cell line. The results presented in this study showed a more specific anti-proliferative activity for [8]- and [10]-gingerol against breast cancer compared to HF and suggest their use as important models for anti-cancer therapy in an attempt to develop new drugs with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Chemicals\n\n[6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol were isolated from the ethanol extract of the ginger rhizome (purchased locally) by liquid chromatography. The structures were elucidated by 1H NMR using a Bruker DRX200 instrument (Bruker, USA), operating at 200 MHz for 1H spectra, with TMS as internal standard, GC-MS on a Shimadzu QP 5000 and comparison with literature data. The purity was determined by elemental analysis on an EA 1108, CHMS-O (Fisons). HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from JTBaker Company (Netherland). Water was deionised. All other analytical grade reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n### [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation\n\nThe fresh ginger rhizome was thin sliced, dried at 40 degC and ground to powder. The powder was extracted with ethanol for 72 h, three times. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 degC. The extraction of ginger (0.4 kg dry weight) yielded 21.2 g of crude extract (5.3%). The extract was stored at -4 degC for the later fractionation.\n\nIn order to isolate [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, dry ginger rhizome crude ethanol extract was chromatographed on SiO2 (70-230 mesh) column with bed height 20 cm (20 cm x 8 cm i.d.), using initially _n_-hexane (1 L), to eliminate the lipids. After, _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate 50:50 (v/v, 2.5 L) was used as eluent resulting in 5 fractions (A1-5), where the fractions A1, A2, A3 and A4 (68.8%, 14.6 g), rich in [6]- and [10]-gingerols, were joined resulting in the fraction A1-4. Part of this fraction (5.5 g) was re-chromatographed on SiO2 column (28 cm x 5 cm i.d.) using _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate 60:40 (v/v, 2.4 L). Forty eight fractions (50 mL each) were collected and combined after monitoring by TLC resulting in six sub-fractions with the following volumes: 250 mL (B1), 400 mL(B2), 150 mL(B3), 800 mL(B4), 200 mL(B5) and 600 mL (B6). The gingerols were the main constituent on the fraction B4 (800 mL, 2.8 g, yellow oil).\n\nAnalytical and semi-preparative HPLC were carried out using a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP system with an SPD-10AVP UV-vis detector with a flow cell analytical or flow cell preparative, according with the HPLC mode (analytical or semi-preparative), and a Shimadzu LC-6AD pump. The isolation optimization was carried out on a Lura-C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., 10 mm, homemade, UFSCar, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil) and the column was maintained at 25 degC, the detection wavelength was set at 282 nm and the flow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phases consisted of isocratic binary mixtures (v/v) of MeOH/H2O (80:20; 75:25; 70:30) and ACN/H2O (67:33). Forty microliters of methanol containing 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of B4 sample were injected. In the column scale-up reverse phase semi-preparative, a Luna-C18 column (300 mm x 10 mm i.d., 10 mm, homemade, UFSCar, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil) was used. This column was maintained at 25 degC, the detection wavelength was set at 254 nm (lower absorbance wavelength for the gingerols) and the flow rate at 6.0 mL/min. The best mobile phase was MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v) and the scale-up factor was calculated using Eq. (1) below, where \\(S\\), \\(R\\), \\(L\\), \\(P\\), \\(A\\) are scale-up factor, column radius, column length, semi-preparative and analytical columns, respectively. The maximum amount of fraction B4 injected in the semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg diluted to final volume of 400 mL.\n\n\\[S = \\frac{R_{\\text{P}}^{2}\\text{xL}_{\\text{H}}}{R_{\\text{A}}^{2}\\text{xL}_{\\text{H}}}\\]\n\n### Cell line and culture\n\nMDA-MB-231 human breast tumor and HF cell lines, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), were maintained at 37 degC in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cutilab - Campinas; SP, Brazil) containing 10% of FBS (fetal bovine serum), penicillin (100 UI/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and L-glutamine (2 mM). Cell cultures and experiments were conducted in a humidified environment with 5% CO2 at 37 degC.\n\n### Proliferation assays\n\nCell lines were prepared at a concentration of 5 x 104 cells/200 mL, in appropriate medium with 10% of FBS, and plated on sterile 96-well plates for 5 h. After cell adhesion to the plates, the DMEM medium was replaced by DMEM medium without FBS and cells were maintained for 14-18 h at 37 degC and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. This procedure, known as starvation, was used to synchronize the cell cycle. After starvation, the culture medium was removed from the wells and a new one, supplemented with 10% of FBS, containing different concentrations of the tested compounds was added to the wells. The cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h under the same conditions as described above. Cell proliferation assay was performed in comparison to the wells where the vehicle compound (2.5% DMSO) was added instead of the tested compounds. After incubation, the culture medium of each well was removed and a solution containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added (100 mL/well). The plates were then kept at 37 degC for 4 h and the formed crystals were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. The absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 595 nm. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control for inhibition of cell proliferation [15].\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nEach experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and a standard error mean was calculated. Shapiro-Wilk's \\(W\\) test was used to verify data normality. As normal distribution was present, the results were compared statistically with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Since the ANOVA tests showed significant differences (acceptable \\(P\\) level < 0.05). Bonferroni's significant difference _post_ hoc analyses were performed to determine differences between simple and grouped main-effect means, respectively. The data were analyzed by using Statistica software (version 8.0; Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, USA) and IC50 calculations were made using Hill's equation in the Origin software (version 8.5; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA).\n\n## Results\n\n### [6]-, [8]- and [10]-Gingerol isolation\n\nFour different conditions were carried out on analytical C18 column HPLC to achieve the best separation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol. The best separation condition was achieved using MeOH/H2O 75:25 (v/v), where a good separation of three gingerols in a single run of 30 min was obtained (Fig. 1).\n\nThe injection volume (400 mL) was larger than the usual size of an injection volume and also it was not the one that was calculated by the scale up formula. This occurred because of the sample viscosity, which would be very high if 170.1 mg were diluted in 230 mL (calculated volume) that would impair the chromatographic separation. For column overloading with the sample, increasing amounts of fraction B4 (0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg diluted to final volume 40 mL) were injected in a C18 analytical column. Using the detector at 282 nm electronic saturation was observed when 5 mg of sample was injected, although the peaks were still visible for isolation of gingerols until 15 mg. With the injection of 30 mg of sample, the electronic saturation hindered the visualization of peaks closer to peak 1 (Fig. 2). To solve this problem, on the semi-preparative mode, the detector was set at 254 nm and in this condition it was possible to identify the three gingerols present in the fraction.\n\nUsing Eq. (1) for the determination of scale-up factor, the value 5.67 was obtained, consequently the maximum amount of B4 fraction that could be injected in a semi-preparative column was 170.1 mg (Fig. 3). However, to make the adjustment of the flow rate easier we decided to use 6.0 mL/min instead of 5.67 mL/min, and by working in this condition the results obtained were satisfactory.\n\nThe mass of each gingerol obtained from 170.1 mg of fraction B4 was: 94 mg ([6]-gingerol), 22 mg ([8]-gingerol) and 17 mg ([10]-gingerol). The purity of gingerols was calculated based on the elemental analysis of each gingerol. The purification yields based on the fresh ginger weight were 1027, 241 and 187 ppm for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively. The purity obtained was 94.4, 99 and 97.3% for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively.\n\nFig. 1: Chromatograms of fraction enriched in [6]-gingerol (peak 1), [8]-gingerol (peak 2) and [10]-gingerol (peak 3), obtained from HPLC in analytical scale.

The injected masses were 0.156 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg. The injection volume was 40 μM.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n### Identification of [6], [8] and [10]-gingerol\n\nThe gingerols were identified based on the 1H NMR and MS spectra data compared with literature [16,17].\n\n#### 3.2.1 [6]-Gingerol\n\nVellow oil; C17H26O4.

The same pattern was observed after 48 h of [10]-gingerol incubation; there was a cell proliferation inhibition of about 90% (Fig. 4A).\n\nHF were used in order to compare the effects of both [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in a non tumor cell line (Figs. 4A and B and 5). No significant differences in MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation using 1, 10, 50 and 100 \\(\\mu\\)M for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol in 24 or 48 h of incubation were verified. However, 500 and 1000 \\(\\mu\\)M concentrations were effective in this inhibition, but in an approximate rate of only 50% (Fig. 4A and B).\n\nThe differential effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol 100 \\(\\mu\\)M after 48 h of incubation with HF and MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line are demonstrated in Fig. 5. These compounds were more effective in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (MDA-MB-231) when compared to normal cell proliferation (HF). The IC50 values for [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation were calculated. The results showed that these compounds inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line with IC50 of 666.2 \\(\\pm\\) 134.6 \\(\\mu\\)M; 135.6 \\(\\pm\\) 22.6 \\(\\mu\\)M and 12.1 \\(\\pm\\) 0.3 \\(\\mu\\)M, respectively. These substances also inhibit HF cell proliferation, nevertheless, we were not able to calculate the IC50 values for this cell line, since the initial concentration that had an effect was 500 \\(\\mu\\)M for [6]-, [8] and [10]-gingerol.\n\n## Discussion\n\nStudies of isolation and purification of gingerols are scarce in the literature. Considering the interesting biological activities and the potential of these compounds to the medical area it is imperative to develop new methodologies to achieve an optimization of gingerol separation and purification. The isolation of gingerols ([6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol) described in this work was achieved satisfactorily, once it was possible to obtain relatively high mass and a good degree of gingerols purity. To our knowledge, only one work about isolation of gingerols using HPLC system was published [18]. In this work, the authors isolated the major gingerols from the crude dichloromethane extract of ginger rhizome by normal phase HPLC. A low purity degree (calculated by the percentage of peak area) for both, [8]-gingerol (86%) and [10]-gingerol (84%) was achieved, while for the [6]-gingerol the purity was 99%. The purity degree obtained for each gingerol does not represent the real one, because HPLC system using UV detection does not guarantee the absence of other components in the sample. In a recent work, the isolation of [6]-, [8]- and [10]-gingerol was carried out using counter-current chromatography (CCC). In this study gingerols were obtained with high purity degree (99%), however the time of chromatographic run was very length (240 min) [19]. In another work regarding isolation of gingerols from crude extract of ginger rhizome using CCC the time of chromatographic run was again very extensive, and the purity was about 98% [20].\n\nElectronic saturation is a factor that considerable limits the increasing of injected mass in the semi-preparative scale. In our work, this factor had limited injections of samples with higher masses, even at a wavelength of low absorption of gingerols (254 nm) (Fig. 3). However, the gingerols were isolated in significant quantities and with a good purity degree. To avoid the electronic saturation we could use either a less sensitive flow cell or make the adjustment of the wavelength well off the lambda max. We have not tried a less sensitive cell, however all the experiment conditions were tested in the lower absorption wavelength for the gingerols, and we still obtained electronic saturation. It may be possible to use other detectors even though we have only used UV.\n\nThe effects of [6]-gingerol on tumor cell proliferation are already well documented [5, 21, 22, 23], however, the effects of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on tumor cells are still scarce. In fact, among all the ginger constituents, much more attention has been given to [6]-gingerol in order to explore its pharmacological properties and action mechanisms. In this sense, besides [6]-gingerol effects, those of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on _in vitro_ tumor cell proliferation using MDA-MB-231 and HF cell lines were also investigated.\n\nThe overall results suggest that the higher the alkyl chain, the greater the effectiveness of gingerol in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, probably due to the manner in which these substances enter the cells through their plasma membrane. In general, with increasing alkyl chain lengths, there is an increase in lipophilic character (log _P_) of compounds, and this can be quantified by the partition coefficient (_P_) in an n-octanol/water system. It is also known that the higher the log \\(P\\) value, to a certain extent, the higher will be the permeation in biological membranes [24, 25]. This can be extended to compounds such as gingerols, which represent a homologous series of substances.\n\nSimilar effects of gingerols and other ginger-derived substances were already described in the literature. Tjendraputra et al. [26] demonstrated that the inhibition of COX-2 by ginger constituents and synthetic analogs was structure-dependent. The lipophilicity and the functional group substitution on the alkyl side chain, as well as the aromatic moiety were the main aspects influencing COX-2 inhibition. Similar correlations between the side-chain length of gingerols and their activities of apoptosis induction and neuronal cells protection from b-amyloid insult have already been demonstrated [27, 28].\n\nThe cytotoxic effect of [8]- and [10]-gingerol has been investigated by a few authors [27, 29]. Kim and coworkers [29] have tested the effects of [8] and [10]-gingerol in a variety of human tumor cells lines including A-549 (lung cancer), SK-OV-3 (ovarian cancer), SK-MEL-2 (skin cancer) and HCT15 (colon cancer). They found an IC50 ranging from approximately 4.52 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL (13 \\(\\mu\\)M) to 12.57 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL (40 \\(\\mu\\)M), with [10]-gingerol being more effective than [8]-gingerol in decreasing the viability of these tumor cell lines [29]. Wei and coworkers [27] found an IC50 of 87.9 \\(\\pm\\) 3.5 \\(\\mu\\)M and 56.5 \\(\\pm\\) 6.0 \\(\\mu\\)M for [8]- and [10]-gingerol, respectively, in the inhibition of HL-60 proliferation, a human leukemia tumor cell line. These data are in accordance with the findings in this work on MDA-MB-231 cells, revealing the same activity dependence on the chain length size pattern.\n\nKuo and collaborators [30] working with SW480 cells, a lineage of colorectal cancer, observed that [10]-gingerol caused a significant concentration-dependent and sustained [Ca\\({}^{2+}\\)]i rise, suggesting that this elevation can alter cellular functions, leading to cell death. They found a cytotoxic effect of [10]-gingerol 50, 75 and 100 \\(\\mu\\)M [30]. It is important to notice that the methodology in the present study was different, even though, similar effects were found in MDA-MB-231 tumor cell line.\n\nOur findings demonstrate a specificity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol on the inhibition of breast tumor cell proliferation when compared to non tumor human fibroblast cell line. The findings of other authors corroborate with our results. Kazi et al. [31] described the effects of antibiotics derived from b-lactam, lactam 1 and 12 on normal and tumor cells. They show that lactam 1 selectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat T, but not in the non transformed, immortalized human natural killer cells. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that lactam 12 induces apoptosis selectively in Jurkat T and simian virus 40-transformed, but not in non transformed NK and parental normal fibroblast cells. The authors propose that these N-tholated b-lactams act by inducing DNA damage that leads to apoptosis preferentially in cancer and transformed over normal/non transformed cells. Another example includes pancratistatin, a natural compound isolated from the \n\n## Page 6\n\nspider lily, which is an efficient inducer of apoptosis in human lymphoma (Jurkat) cells, with minimal effect on normal nucleated blood cells. The authors discuss that this selective effect could be due to the expression of the Fas receptors, which are found to be greater in blood lymphoma cells than normal blood cells. Furthermore, in fast-dividing cancer cells, the plasma membrane tends to run short of lipids, perhaps changing the fluidity of the membrane [32]. Ovadje et al. [33] demonstrate that dandelion root extract is capable of inducing apoptosis at low concentrations specifically in cancer cells with no toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, Mathen et al. [34] working with extracts from _Calotropis gigamate_, the giant milkweed, traditionally used for the treatment of cancer and in Ayuravledi medicine and _Poecilocerus pictus_, an orthopteran insect, which feeds on _C. gigantea_, demonstrated that both the insect and the plant extracts induce concentration-dependent apoptosis and differentiate between human cancer cells and normal cells and exhibit species specificity.\n\nThe chemopreventive mechanisms of singereols are not well understood however, are thought to involve proapoptotic [27, 35, 36, 37], antioxidant [38], anti-inflammatory [6, 39, 40, 41], and anti-angiogenic [42] activities. Further investigation will be done in order to determine the mechanisms by which [8]- and [10]-gingerol act inhibiting with more specificity the MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this work presents a new methodology for the isolation of singereols, which proved to be effective, once considerable amounts with a good purity degree in a relatively short time of chromatographic run were achieved from these important bioactive compounds, mainly [8]-gingerol (99%) and [10]-gingerol (97.3%). This is the first report on the separation of these compounds with such a purity degree using HPLC semi-preparative scale. Optimizations in the separation process regarding column overloading can still be made so that the electron saturation be not reached, which can be achieved by using other less sensitive detectors. The singereols isolated through this methodology, demonstrate an anti-proliferative activity of [8]- and [10]-gingerol specifically on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells when compared to HF normal cells. As far as we know, this is the first report regarding a specific cell effect of ginger derivatives. The results also suggest the use of [8]- and [10]-gingerol as important models for anti-cancer therapy and drug design in an attempt to develop new compounds with fewer side effects when compared to conventional chemotherapy.\n\n## References\n\n* (1) T.

Their structures were determined by IR, HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR experiments, and their antioxidant activities, evaluated by assaying the free radical scavenging capacity using the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-pic-rylhydrazyl) radical as substrate. The antioxidant activities of **3** and **4** (IC50 values of 15.0 and 19.2 uM, respectively) were comparable to that of the standard positive control caffeic acid, whilst **2** and **5** were only weakly active and **1** was inactive.\n\nkeywords: _Coussarea hydrangeifolia_; Rubiaceae; Phenylpropanol glycosides; Antioxidant activity +\nFootnote †: journal:\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAlthough _Coussarea_ is considered to be only a small genus within the taxon Rubiaceae, it is well represented in the main Brazilian biomes including the Amazonia and the Cerrado. _Coussarea hydrangeifolia_, commonly know as \"falsa-quina\", is characteristic of the vegetation of the Cerrado and of the semi-deciduous forests of Brazil, where it is considered to be a pioneer species (Correa, 1974). In the course of our studies concerning the bioactive principles of Brazilian plants, with special emphasis on the vegetation of the State of Sao Paulo (Pauletti et al., 2003; Hamerski et al., 2003), we found that the aqueous extract of the leaves of _C. hydrangeifolia_ showed antioxidant activity, as determined by a preliminary test with b-carotene, and strong free radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH). Fractionation of this extract provided five phenylpropanol glycosides including two new compounds, **1** and **2,** which had their structures determined by spectroscopic methods.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nCompound **1** was isolated from the aqueous extract of _C. hydrangeifolia_ as an amorphous powder with an \\([a]_{\\rm D}^{30}\\) of \\(-44.3^{\\circ}\\). A quasimolecular ion peak \\([{\\rm M}-{\\rm H}]^{-}\\) for **1** was observed at _m/z_ 415.1610 in the high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrum (HRESIMS; negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula of C19H28O10. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorption bands at 3430 and 1042 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) suggesting the presence of hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed signals that could be attributed to a monosubstituted benzene ring [\\(\\delta\\) 7.54 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-2,6), 7.30 (_m_, H-3,5), 7.23 (_m_, H-4)], a b-o-glucosyl moiety [\\(\\delta\\) 4.90 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-1'), 4.06 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 7.5, 8.0 Hz, H-2'), 4.19 (_t_ like, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-3'), 4.12 (_m_, H-4), 4.20 (_ddd_, \\(J\\) = 9.5, 7.5, 2.5 Hz, H-5'), 4.18 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 11.0, 7.5 Hz, H-6'), 4.64 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 11.0, 2.5 Hz, H-6'), and a rhamnosyl group [\\(\\delta\\) 5.55 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 1.0 Hz, H-1''), 4.62 (_m_, H-2''), 4.55 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 3.5, 9.0 Hz, H-3''), 4.26 (_t_ like, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, H-4''), 4.97 (_m_, H-5), 1.62 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.0 Hz, H-6''). Additionally, the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 4.85 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 11.5 Hz) and 5.15 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 11.5 Hz) could be ascribed to benzylic oxymethylene hydrogens, thus characterising the aromatic portion of **1** as a benzylic system. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals at \\(\\delta\\) 137.8, 128.2 (\\(\\times\\)), 127.9 (\\(\\times\\)), 127.2 and 70.9, which were consistent with the presence of a monosubstituted benzylic ring. Two anomeric methane carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 103.7 and 102.6, several hydroxymethines, one hydroxymethylene carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 68.4 and one methyl group at \\(\\delta\\) 18.7 resembled those of glucose and rhamnose, respectively, and clearly suggested that **1** possessed glucopyranosyl and rhamnopyranosyl units. Data from COSY and TOCSY experiments revealed the hydrogen sets belonging to the glucosyl and rhamnosyl moieties. The complete assignment of hydrogen and carbon signals and the positions of the bonds of the sugar moieties in **1** were determined by an HMBC experiment which showed long-range correlations between H-6' and C-4' and the anomeric C-1'', between H-1'' and the methylene C-6', and between H-7 of the benzylic system and C-1'\n\n## Page 3\n\nof the glucosyl moiety and C-2/C-6 of the aromatic system. Consequently, the structure of **1** was established to be 1'-_O_-benzyl-a-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'' - 6')-b-d-glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin I.\n\nCompound **2** exhibited a quasimolecular ion peak [M - H]- at _m_/_z_ 635.1828 in the HRESIMS (negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula C26H36O18. MS/MS analysis of the quasimolecular ion revealed a significant fragment ion at _m_/_z_ 502.1321 assigned to [M - H - deoxyhexose]-. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) clearly showed the presence of three sugar moieties together with nine additional signals that could be attributed to the aglycone moiety. Data from the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of an (_E_)-caffeoyl system [1H, d 7.97 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 15.5 Hz, H-7), 6.56 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 15.5 Hz, H-8), 7.53 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-2), 7.16 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-5), 7.10 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 2.0, 8.0 Hz, H-6)] together with three anomeric protons, two of which [5.35 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and 6.20 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz)] were assigned to the two b-glucose units, and one [d 5.90 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 3.5 Hz)], to an a-xylose moiety. From the 13C NMR spectrum it could be established that the aromatic unit was an ester of (_E_)-caffeic acid [d 165.3 (C-9), 145.5 (C-7), 114.4 (C-8), 126.6 (C-1), 115.8 (C-2), 147.0 (C-3), 148.7 (C-4), 116.7 (C-5), 122.2 (C-6)]. Complete assignment of the protons in each sugar system was achieved by considering the 1D and 2D TOCSY, 1D and 2D NOESY, and the 1H-1H COSY spectra, while the carbons were assigned from HMQC and HMBC data. A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at \\(d\\) 5.35 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) revealed a set of coupled oxymethine protons (_d_ 4.29, 4.14, 4.25 and 4.03) and a methylene proton (_d_ 4.39). These data, when analysed with the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum, led to the identification of a b-d-glucosyl moiety. Its position at C-3 of the caffeic acid moiety was established unambiguously by HMBC correlations observed between the anomeric proton H-1'' at \\(d\\) 5.35 and C-3 (_d_ 147.0), and from the proton at \\(d\\) 7.10 (H-6) to C-2 (_d_ 115.8) and C-4 (_d_ 148.7). A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at \\(d\\) 6.20 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz) showed a set of coupled oxymethine protons (_d_ 4.27, 4.34, 4.36 and 4.08) and oxymethylene protons (_d_ 4.40 and 4.60). Analysis of the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum led to the identification of an additional b-d-glucosyl moiety. From the HMBC correlation observed between the signals at \\(d\\) 6.20 (H-1') and \\(d\\) 165.3 [the carbonyl of the (_E_)-caffeoyl group], the site of esterification with the (_E_)-caffeoyl acid unit was determined to be at C-1' of the glucopyranosyl. The downfield shift of C-2' (_d_ 78.8) together with the upfield shift of C-1' (_d_ 96.1) of the b-glucopyranosyl unit also suggested that the a-xylopyranosyl unit was attached to C-2' of the glucopyranosyl moiety. The cross peak in the HMBC experiment between \\(d\\) 4.27 (_t_, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, H-2') and \\(d\\) 75.5 (C-4''), and the correlation in the NOESY experiment between the signals at \\(d\\) 4.27 (_t_, \\(J\\) = 9.0, H-2') and at \\(d\\) 4.75 (_t_, \\(J\\) = 9.0, H-4''), confirmed the (4'' - 2') linkage of the disaccharide moiety. Acid hydrolysis of **2** afforded glucose and xylose, which were identified by TLC by comparison with authentic samples. Consequently, the structure of **2** was established as a-l-xylopyranosyl-(4'' - 2')-(3-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl)-1'-_O_ _E_-caffeoyl-b-d-glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin II (see Fig. 1).\n\nCompound **3** was identified as 1,6-di-_O_-caffeoyl-b-d-glucopyranose from physical and spectroscopic data (Akhmedov and Litvinenko, 1968). Although this compound was first isolated from _Scrophularia grossheim_ (a traditional medicinal plant used in Russia for the treatment of jaundice, hepatitis and rheumatism), to the best of our knowledge its 13C NMR spectroscopic data remain unreported. The assignment of the 13C NMR signals of **3**, based mainly on 1D and 2D NMR experiments, is provided in Table 1. Compounds **4** and **5** were identified as 1-_O_-(_E_)-caffeoyl-b-d-glucopyranose and 1-_O_-(_E_)-feruloyl-b-d-glucopyranoside, respectively (Birkofer et al., 1961, 1969).\n\nPreliminary TLC autographic test using b-carotene as revealing agent (Silva et al., 2001) evidenced several anti-oxidant compounds in the aqueous extract from leaves of _C. hydrangeifolia_. Compounds **1**-**5**, isolated from this extract, were evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity towards the stable free radical DPPH (Pauletti et al., 2003), and compared to standard antioxidants\n\nFig. 1: Selected HMBC correlations (H → C) for hydrangeifolin I (**1**) and hydrangeifolin II (**2**), and NOESY correlations for **2**.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\ncaffeic and _p_-coumaric acids, used as positive controls. As shown on Table 2, compounds **3** and **4** exhibited strong antioxidant activities, comparable with that of caffeic acid, probably due to the presence of the 3,4-dihydroxy (catechol) moiety in their structures. Compounds **2** and **5**, which bear only one free hydroxy group, showed weak free radical scavenging activities towards DPPH and compound **1** was inactive.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General\n\nIR and UV spectra were obtained using Perkin-Elmer model 1600 series FTIR and Lambda 14P UV/ VIS spectrometers, respectively. ES-MS were measured on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRESIMS on a VG Autospec (40 eV) spectrometer. 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (125 MHz) and 2D NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Inova model 500 spectrometer. The NMR data were measured in pyridine-\\(d_{5}\\) or DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) and chemical shifts are expressed in \\(\\delta\\) (ppm) values with reference to TMS. Preparative HPLC was conducted using a Phenomenex Luna ODS column (\\(250\\times 21.20\\) mm i.d.; 10 \\(\\mu\\)m) coupled to a Varian PrepStar S0-1 pump with flow rate of the mobile phase set at 10 mL/min; and a Varian ProStar 320 UV/VIS detector set at 254 nm. Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia), C-18 (Merck) and Si-gel (Merck) were used as stationary phases in CC fractionations.

A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo (number SP 167423).\n\n### Antioxidant assay\n\nThe b-carotene test was performed on TLC plates according to a previously described method (Pratt and Miller, 1984;Silva et al., 2001). The stable radical DPPH' was used for the determination of free radical scavenging activity: a methanolic solution (200 mM, 2 mL) of DPPH was added to methanol (1 mL) containing an appropriate amount of each test compound in order to yield a final concentration of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 or 5 mM. Caffeic and _p_-coumaric acids were used as standard positive controls, whilst a solution of DPPH (200 mM, 2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as blank. All samples were evaluated as triplicates (_n_ = 3). Each reaction mixture was shaken thoroughly and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The amount of the reduced form of the radical (DPPH-H) generated in situ was determined from the measured decrease in current (_I_) in the electrochemical cell of the EICD (Son and Lewis, 2002). The area measured on each chromatogram was normalised and compared with that obtained for the blank. The radical scavenging activity of each sample was expressed in terms of IC50 (the concentration in mM of test compound required to produce a 50% decrease in \\(I\\) caused by the formation of DPPH-H) (Pauletti et al., 2003).\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nDried and powdered leaves (2.70 kg) of _C. hydrangeifolia_ were extracted with EtOH (3.0 L) for 24 h at room temperature, followed by solvent evaporation under reduced pressure to yield the crude extract (65.80 g). This extract was suspended in water (3.0 L) and partitioned with _n_-BuOH (3.0 L): the aqueous solution was evaporated to dryness and the resulting residue (2.0 g) subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.0 x 120 cm) eluted with MeOH. Fractions (10 mL each) were collected and analysed by TLC (CHCl3/ MeOH 6:4). On the basis of their TLC profiles, fractions 6-10 were combined (380.8 mg) and further subjected to over Sephadex LH-20 CC with MeOH as eluent. Fractions 8-12 from this second column fractionation were combined (54.3 mg) on the basis of their TLC profiles and purified by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2 O (1:9) to yield **1** (12.0 mg; _t_R 12.54 min). Fractions 13-14 from the first Sephadex column were combined (500 mg) and subjected to CC over C-18 eluted with a MeOH/H2O step gradient (in ratios 1:19, 3:17 and 3:2, successively) to yield fractions A, B and C. Fraction A (132.7 mg) was further purified by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (7:93) to yield **2** (35.8 mg; _t_R 10.25 min). Fraction B (67.5 mg) was subjected to HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (1:9) to yield, **3** (6.1 mg; _t_R 22.38 min) and **4** (16.9 mg; _t_R 14.64 min). Fraction C (145.9 mg) was purified under the same conditions and afforded **5** (8.4 mg, _t_R 18.91 min).\n\n#### Hydrangeifolia I. 1'-O-benzyl-a-l-rhamnopyranoside-(1' ~ 6')-b-o-glucopyranoside (1)\n\nAmorphous powder, \\(\\left[ \\alpha \\right\\rbrack_{\\text{D}}^{30} - 44.3^{\\circ}\\) (_c_ = 0.003, MeOH).

It is involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among the proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, cathepsin V is a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In the present work, natural flavonoids were screened against cathepsin V, and two flavones were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. On the basis of this result, a combinatorial library of chalcones and flavones was prepared, in solution phase employing a scavenger reagent, and fully evaluated.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCoronary arterial disease is one of the major causes of human death. In this context, atherosclerosis, which is characterized by a thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall, is the leading cause of cardiac illness. Cathepsin V is a papain-like cysteine protease, involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among proteolytic enzymes.1,2 It is predominantly expressed in the thymus, testicles, and epithelial corneal. Although cathepsin V can be considered a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, few inhibitors are described in the literature.2,3\n\nThe benzopyranoene-ring system, found in flavonoids, is a molecular scaffold of considerable interest, and some reports describe this class of compounds as inhibitors of cathepsin activity. Kenyon and co-workers reported the activity of chalcone derivatives toward the enzyme cathepsin B.4,5 Patil et al. isolated a new dimeric dihydrochalcone and a premy-lated flavone from _Artocarpus altilis_ (Moraceae) which are potent inhibitors of cathepsin K, with IC50 values of 98 and 840 nM, respectively.6 Pan et al.7 and Zeng et al.8 described biflavones isolated from _Taxodium mucronatum_ (Taxodiacea) and _Cycas guizhouensis_ (Cycadaceae) with activity against cathepsin B and K. Bauvois et al. examined the effects of synthetic flavones on a number of metalloproteinases, g-glutamyl transpeptidase as well as serine proteases such as cathepsin G.9\n\nFootnote 4: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 5: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 6: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 7: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nFootnote 8: Universidade Federal de Goias.\n\nMedicinal chemistry efforts have focused on diversifying the benzopyranone scaffold and utilizing combinatorial chemistry approaches to construct small benzopyrano libraries.10 In the literature are described several flavonoid libraries synthesized in solution phase, such as, for example, chalcones11-13 and flavones.14,15\n\nSolid-phase organic synthesis (SPOS) has long been an integral component of the synthetic repertoire employed by combinatorial chemists.16 In SPOS, solid support-bound substrates are elaborated synthetically by using an excess of reagents to drive reactions to completion. Desired products can then be isolated easily by simple filtration and removed from the support material. Previous reviews have discussed the importance of combinatorial libraries of flavonoids prepared by solid phase synthesis.17-19 Nicolaou et al. reported a solid-phase synthesis of a 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran motif employing a cycloloading strategy that relies on the use of a polystyrene-based selenenyl bromide resin.20 Haikrishnan and Showalter prepared a small library of isoflavone analogues employing a solid-supported diisopropylsilyloxy traceless linker.21 Cheng et al. prepared a small library of chalcones via parallel solid phase synthesis.22 A different strategy was employed by Yao et al. for the preparation of a flavone library.23 A functionalized flavone was prepared in solution phase by classical Claisen condensation, mixed acid nitration, and oxidative cyclization reaction with iodine-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Then, the flavone was employed as scaffold for the synthesis of a combinatorial library in solid phase. Arai et al. developed an efficient one-pot synthesis by Michael aldol reaction of chromone and flavonoid derivatives bearing heterocyclic units.24 The 2,3-heterocycle-substituted chromones were obtained in one step. Moreover, the use of substituted benzaldehydes and subsequent addition of heterocyclic aldehydes gave 3-pyridyl-substituted flavones. They have also examined these one-pot reactions in the solid phase by attaching the acetophenone derivative to (4-methoxyphenyl)-diisopropylsilylpropyl polystyrene beads.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nSPOS has many advantages but also many limiting drawbacks: it can be difficult to adapt conventional solution phase chemistry to a solid-phase format, some solid-phase reactions are significantly slower than they are when run in solution, and the progress of solid-phase reactions can be difficult to monitor.[11] An alternative is the use of polymer-supported reagents, catalysts, and cleanup agents (scavengers) which facilitate reactions of substrates in solution. For example, a solid-supported reagent can be used to drive to completion a coupling reaction between two reactive substrates, one of which is present in excess. A support-bound scavenger can then be used to remove the excess reagent, yielding pure product. Or a support-bound capture reagent can be used to remove the coupling product directly, which is then cleaved from the support.[25] Bhat et al. employed a piperazinyl Merrifield resin in the synthesis of a library of flavones.[26] Huang et al. described a solid-phase synthesis of flavones employing a Lewis acid-mediated polystyrene-supported selenium induced intramolecular cyclization of chalcones.[27] After the oxidative cleavage of selenium resin, the flavones were obtained in good overall yields and high purity.\n\nIn the present work, we describe the use of tosyl hydrazide scavenger resin in the preparation of a combinatorial library of chalcone and flavone derivatives, identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nIn an ongoing program toward the development of specific, potent inhibitors of cathepsin V enzyme, several natural products were screened. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation:\n\n\\[\\%\\;\\text{inhibition} = 100 \\times (1 - V_{t}/V_{0})\\]\n\nwhere \\(V_{i}\\) and \\(V\\)0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determined in the presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively.\n\nAmong some other active compounds, a series of flavonoids showed interesting activity at initial concentration of 25 _m_M. The most potent compounds were flavones **1** and **2** (Figure 1), isolated from _Vitex polygamma_ (Verbenaceae)[28] and _Lonchocarpus subglaucescens_ (Leguminosee),[29] respectively, with IC50 = 2.5 and 13.5 _m_M. The IC50 values correspond to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V, and were determined from collected data by non-linear regression analysis.\n\nOn the basis of these results, a small library of flavonoids was prepared in solution phase employing the Claisen\\(-\\)Schmidt condensation,[30] followed by oxidative cyclization catalyzed by I2 (Scheme 1).[31] The library components were obtained in moderate to good yields and were characterized by 1H NMR and MS. The compounds then were submitted to biochemical evaluation against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 1).\n\nIn this small series we have already identified flavone (**6d**) with a higher inhibition activity than the natural products **1**\n\nFigure 1: Natural flavonoids evaluated against cathepsin V.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nand **2**. To evaluate a larger number of flavonoids and establish some structure\\(-\\)activity relationships, a flavone library was prepared through parallel synthesis using the polystyrene-tosyrl hydrazide (PS-Ts-NHNHH2) (**7**) as a carbonyl scavenging resin.[32] Before carrying out the synthesis of the library some tests were realized to optimize the reaction conditions using the resin. The best results were obtained using 0.075 mmol of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxyacetophenone, 0.1 mmol of resin **7**, and 0.1 mmol of 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and the presence of the aldehydes was not observed. Following the reaction conditions previously tested, a library of chalcones and flavones was prepared (Scheme 2) using 4 acetophenones (**3**) (Figure 2) and 6 aldehydes (**4**) as building blocks (Figure 3). The diversity of the library was planned based on the structure of natural products **1** and **2**, which are highly oxygenated, and also on the commercial availability of reagents.\n\nThe reactions were carried out in 24 reaction vessels of a Buchi Syncore synthesizer. Initially, for the Claisen\\(-\\)Schmidt condensation, to a solution containing the acetophenone **3** and the aldehyde **4** in methanol was added an aqueous solution of 50% KOH. After 3 h at 75 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, an aqueous solution of 10% HCl was added to neutralize the mixture. Excess of aldehyde was removed from the reaction mixture by the use of resin scavenger **7** in dimethylformamide (DMF). Oxidative cyclization was carried out in DMSO at 150 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 1 h using iodine as catalyst.\n\nThirteen chalcones **5** were purified by preparative TLC and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 2). As observed before, the chalcones showed no activity. The flavones were purified by SPE or preparative TLC.

All compounds were characterized by \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR, and the spectroscopic data were compared with those reported in the literature.[33; 34; 35; 36; 37; 38; 39; 40; 41; 42; 43; 44; 45; 46; 47; 48; 49; 50; 51; 52; 53; 54; 55; 56; 57] The library components were submitted to biochemical evaluation (Table 3).\n\nThe first aspect of the validation of these results was the analysis of false positives. Depending on the assay design and detection method used for the screening assay, various artifacts can occur that lead to wrong results. Before performing the screening, all compounds were analyzed on a fluorimeter using the test conditions without the addition of the enzyme. Flavones **6a**, **6c**, **6**{_1,2_}, **6**{_2,4_}, and **6**{_4,4_} showed intrinsic fluorescence; thus, it was not possible to verify their potency as inhibitors. Compounds that inhibited more than 50% were selected for determination of IC\\({}_{50}\\) values. When diluted, flavones **6**{_1,1_}, **6**{_1,3_}, and **6**{_2,1_} showed fluorescence above the control, suggesting that at lower concentrations these compounds may cause a conformational change of the protein, and it was not possible to observe the fluorescence quenching, thus interfering with the response of the test.\n\nMost of the flavones showed significant inhibition with IC\\({}_{50}\\) values varying in the range of 0.8\\(-\\)25.1 \\(\\mu\\)M. Primary studies on the structure\\(-\\)activity relationships (SAR) of the flavonoids suggest the importance of the ring C. Interestingly the chalcones exhibited lower inhibition in a unique concentration demonstrating that cyclization to form the C ring is relevant to interaction between enzyme site and inhibitor. We also observed that among the most potent compounds, flavones **6d**, **6**{_3,1_}, and **6**{_3,2_} (IC\\({}_{50}\\) = 1.2, 0.8, and 1.6 \\(\\mu\\)M, respectively) possess one halogen (bromine or fluorine) as substituent in the A ring and methoxy groups in the C ring.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the lack of a detailed experimental enzyme\\(-\\)inhibitor complex, from the natural products screening, we have been able to identify synthetic flavones with increased potency. These results indicate the potential of this class as promising inhibitors of cathepsin V. To further investigate these results and thus generate useful data for the computer aided molecular design, modeling studies are being performed through docking protocol.\n\n## 3 Experimental Section\n\nAll commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Reagents and solvents were purified when necessary according to the usual procedures described in the literature. \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-200 (200 and 50 MHz respectively). The IR spectra refer to films and were measured on a Bomem M102 spectrometer. Mass Spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on a 0.25 \\(\\mu\\)m film of silica gel containing fluorescent indicator UV254 supported on an aluminum sheet (Sigma-Aldrich). Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 230\\(-\\)400 mesh, E. Merck). Gas chromatography was performed in a Shimadzu GC-17A with H\\({}_{2}\\) as carrier and using a DB-5 column. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was carried out using silica cartridges (Phenomenex Strata Silica SL-1, 500 mg, 6 mL). HPLC analyses were performed in Shimadzu equipment with a LC-20AT pump, SIL-10A injector, SPD-20A detector, and in a Phenomenex column Luna C18(2) 5 \\(\\mu\\)m (150 \\(\\times\\) 4.6 mm). The combinatorial library was prepared in a Syncore Buchi synthesizer.\n\n**General Procedure for the Synthesis of Chalcones 5a\\(-\\)e.** To a solution of acetophenone **3** and aldehyde **4** in methanol was added an aqueous solution of KOH 50% (Table 5).

Vieira, and Sakae Komatsu\n\nDivision of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natural Resources, University of California,\n\nBerkeley, California 94720\n\n###### Abstract\n\nThree anacardic acids (1-3) have been isolated as cytotoxic agents against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells from the cashew _Anacardium occidentale_ (Anacardiaceae) apple juice. In addition to these anacardic acids, the cytotoxicity of their 13 congeners (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut and nut shell oil has also been examined. Anacardic acids (1-4), cards (5-8), and methylacardols (9-12) have been found to exhibit moderate cytotoxic activity against both BT-20 breast and HeLa epithelial cervix carcinoma cells.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nWe now control many tumors with available antitumor agents. However, the need for new antitumor agents still exists, especially against solid tumors. The unacceptable and undesired side effects of many antitumor agents are a major problem that needs to be improved, due to the need for the antitumor agents to be used for long durations. It seems that edible plants may be a good source of new antitumor agents. With this in mind, we have screened for new antitumor agents from various tropical fruits and vegetables that have been continuously consumed by many people for many years.\n\nIn recent years the cashew (_Anacardium occidentale_ L.) (Anacardiaceae) apple has increased in value, especially in the countries where it is grown, such as Brazil. There is no doubt that the nut is the most important product of the cashew tree. However, this tree also yields the pear-shaped \"apple\" to which the nut is attached. The cashew apple is very sour and stringent until fully ripe, when it becomes edible. In contrast to the nut, the apple was neglected until recently, although it is available in far greater tonnage. A number of processes have now been developed for converting the cashew apple into various products such as juice, jam, syrup, chutney, and beverage (Winterhalter, 1991). Cashew apple juice is, in fact, one of the most popular juices in Brazil today.\n\nIn our continuing search for prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors from tropical plants (Kubo et al., 1987) we began to test their antitumor activity, since many prostaglandin-related compounds exhibited potent antitumor activity (Zenser et al., 1980; Powles et al., 1982). Our preliminary screening has found the cashew (_A. occidentale_) apple juice to show significant (ED50 <20 mg/mL) in vitro cytotoxicity against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells. The active principles from a regularly imbibed beverage such as cashew apple juice may be superior as antitumor agents as compared to many nonnatural products. This paper deals with the identification of cytotoxic principles of cashew apple juice.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nGeneral. UV spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 100-80 spectrophotometer in ethanol. IR spectra were acquired on a Perkin-Elmer 1310 IR in KBr. NMR spectra were recorded on a.rEOL GX-400 (400 MHz for 10 and 100 MHz for 150 mCDi). EINS were acquired on a JEOL DX-303H by direct inlet 100 F.Reeycle HPLC (R-HPLC) was performed on a LC-09 (Japan Analytical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) (Kubo and Nakatsu, 1991).\n\nChemicals. The phenolic compounds 1-16 (Figure 1) used for bioassay were from our previous study (Kubo et al., 1986). However, the repurification of some of them was achieved by R-HPLC. Anethole was isolated from the seeds of _Pimpinella anisum_ (Umbellifera) as previously described (Kubo and Himejima, 1991). Iadole, butylated hydroxymisole (BHA), vitamin C, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltriazo-lium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).\n\nPlant Materials. Suco de Caju, a commercial cashew apple juice (Maguary and Milan) was purchased at market places in Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nCell Lines and Media. The cell lines BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma isolated from human, and HeLa ATCC CCL 219, epithelioid cervix carcinoma cell from human, used for the assay were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with nonessential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air at 37 degC. The human monolayer culture were subcultured with a 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution.\n\nCytotoxic Assay. The cytotoxic assays were performed according to a microculture tetrazolium (MTT) method (Carmichael et al., 1987). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtiter plates at 4000-6000 cells/well, with various concentrations of the samples. After incubation, 50 mg/mL MTT (3 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye was solubilized by adding 100 mg/mL DMSO to each well, followed by gentle shaking. The extinction coefficient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photometer Labsystem, at a wavelength of 620 nm.\n\nCombination Study. The combination data were obtained according to the checkerboard method (Nordeen et al., 1979). Thus, a series of the 2-fold dilutions of anacaric acid (1) was tested in combination with 2-fold dilutions of the other (anethole, indole, BHA, and vitamin C) (Figure 2). Each compound was tested at least twice.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe cytotoxicity-guided fractionation using BT-20 breast carcinoma cells has led to the isolation of three active principles from the cashew (_A. occidentale_) apple by R-HPLC using an ODS C1a column. The active compounds were identified by means of spectroscopic methods as anacardic acids, more specifically, 6-[8(Z),11(Z),14-pentadecatrienyl]salicylic acid (1), 6-[8(Z),11-(Z)-pentadecadienyl]salicylic acid (2), and 6-[8(Z)-pentadecenyl]salicylic acid (3). These nonisproach alky side chain phenolic compounds were previously isolated from the cashew (_A. occidentale_) nut shell oil together\n\n## Page 2\n\nwith other similar phenolic compounds such as cardols, methylacradi, and cardanols, with properties as molluscicides (Kubo et al., 1986), prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (Kubo et al., 1987; Grazzini et al., 1991), and antimicrobial agents (Gellerman et al., 1969; Himejima and Kubo, 1991). Similar nonisoprenoid long-chain phenols including anacaridic acid (3) were isolated as antitumor agents against Sarcoma ascites in mice from the sarrotesta of _Ginkgo biloba_ L. (Ginkgoaceae) (Itokawa et al., 1987).\n\nIn addition to the 3 above-mentioned anacaridic acids (1-3) isolated from the cashber apple, 13 additional phenolic compounds (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut and cashew nut shell oil (Tyman, 1979) were also examined for comparison purposes. They were first assayed against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells at 10 _m_g/mL. As a result, anacaridic acids (1-4), cardols (5-8), and methylacradi (9-12) exhibited significant cytotoxicity. Interestingly, cardanols (13-16) did not demonstrate significant activity against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells, although 5-[(8(_Z_),-11(_Z_),14-pentadecatrienyl)resorcinol (5) was previously reported to exhibit potent antitumor activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (Itokawa et al., 1987).\n\nThe ED50 values of the phenolic compounds (1-12) were first obtained against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells (Table I). Then, only the active compounds (ED50 < 10 _m_g/mL) were tested against HeLa epithelial-devi carcinoma cells. The most effective cytotoxicity was observed for the cardols, followed by the anacaridic acids and then the\n\nFigure 1.: Structures of 16 phenolic compounds isolated from the cashew (apple, nut, and nut shell oil), salicylic acid, (17), and resorcinol (18).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nmethylcards. In addition to the natural phenolic compounds (1-16), salicylic acid (17) and resorcinol (18) were also tested. Neither salicylic acid nor resorcinol exhibited any activity against these two carcinoma cells at this concentration. By comparison of salicylic acid (17) and resorcinol (18) with the corresponding anacardic acids (1-4) and cards (5-8), it seems that the addition of a C18 alkyl side chain plays an important role in increasing the cytotoxicity. In fact, \\(P\\) (as the hydrophobic parameter) of long-chain phenols was found to be one of the most important factors for the ED50 values against Chinese hamster V-79 cells (Itokawa et al., 1989).\n\nMoreover, all of the phenolic compounds isolated from the cashew (nut, apple, and nut shell oil) have a C18 alkyl side chain with up to three double bonds. In the previous investigation of their molluscicidal and antimicrobial activities, an increase in the number of double bonds in the side chain, in general, increases the biological activity (Gellerman et al., 1969; Himejima and Kubo, 1991; Kubo et al., 1986). However, this seems not to be the case in the cytotoxic activity, although the phenolics possessing a C18 saturated alkyl side chain were found to be somehow less cytotoxic than the ones with a C18 unsaturated alkyl group.\n\nAlthough the cytotoxicity of these phenolics may not be potent enough to use them as a leading compound for drug design, they are worthy of further investigation as natural products isolated from a daily beverage. Therefore, the enhancement of their cytotoxicity by combining them with other substances was studied. The procedure for selecting these \"other substances\" is, however, still in a preliminary stage. The initial selection of other substances was based largely on our previous combination studies of antimicrobial agents. For example, the antifungal activity of polyyodial against a filamentous fungus _Candida albicans_ was enhanced 32-fold by combining it with sublethal amounts of anethole (Kubo and Himejima, 1991). Similarly, the antibacterial activity of criinid against a cariogenic bacterium _Streptococcus mutans_ was increased 64-fold by BHT (Kubo et al., 1992a), and that of b-cadinene was enhanced 128-fold by indole (Kubo et al., 1992b). Vitamin C was also added for the combination study because of its high content in the cashew apple. Thus, the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content in the cashew apple is reported to be greater than 6 times that for oranges (Cecchi and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981). Moreover, vitamin C (anti-oxidant) was found to increase the antifungal activity of both polyyodial and warburganal 16-fold against a dermatomycotic fungus _Pityosporum ovale_ (Kubo and Himejima, 1992). Since these four compounds have been used as food additives, we can assume that their safety has been established.\n\nFor the combination study, 6-[8(Z),11(Z),14-pentadecatrienylsalicylic acid (1), otherwise known as anacardic acid, was selected for the following reasons: (1) it has been isolated from the edible cashew apple; (2) its ED50 values against the two human solid tumor (BT-20 breast and HeLa epithelial cervix) cells are less than 4 mg/mL, that is, it satisfies the NCI requirement to warrant further investigation; and (3) most importantly for conducting this experiment, it is available in quantity.\n\nAnacardic acid (1) was, therefore, combined with anethole, BHA, indole, and vitamin C, respectively. The combination study was carried out against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells by the checkerboard method (Norden et al., 1979). In contrast to the antimicrobial activity, none of these four compounds dramatically increased the cytotoxicity of anacardic acid (1). Their effect was only additive. As an example, the combination study of anacardic acid (1) with BHA by the checkerboard method is shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe total yield of the antitumor anacardic acids (1-3) in the freeze-dried cashew apple juice was reported at about 0.05% (Kubo et al., 1986). In addition to these anacardic acids, the high content of vitamin C in the cashew apple is described above (Cecchi and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981). Together with previous papers (Kubo et al., 1987; Itokawa et al., 1987), these data suggest that consuming the cashew apple and/or its products continuously for long durations may be advantageous in controlling tumors.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. S.

The MeOH extract of leaves of _Iryanthera juruensis_, one of the plants endemic to the Amazon region and consumed in Brazil, and the hexane extract from its seeds inhibited lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2)) enzymes in in vitro assays. Further analyses of these extracts yielded 5-deoxyflavones (**1**-**5**) from the leaf extract and sargachromenol (**6**), sargaquinoic acid (**7**), a novel juruenoic acid (**8**), _o_-aryalkanoic acids (**9a**-**c**), and the lignan guaiacin (**10**) from the seed extract.

However, compounds **7** and **8** were inactive and lignan **10** exhibited LPO inhibitory activity by 99% at 100 ppm compared to commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and vitamin E. The flavones **1**-**5** also inhibited COX-1 and -2 enzymes by 50-65% at 100 ppm. Compound **6** showed high but nonselective inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, when compared to aspirin and Celebrex, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Compounds **7** and **10** inhibited COX-1 by 60% and 65% and COX-2 by 37% and 18%, respectively, whereas compounds **8** and **9a**-**c** showed little or no activity against these enzymes.\n\n**Keywords:** _Iryanthera juruensis_; Myristicaceae; lipid peroxidation; cyclooxygenase; flavone; tocotrienol; o-aryalkanoic acids; lignan\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nPlants from Myristicaceae family have been traditionally used as food supplements by South American Indians. The anecdotal health benefits of these plants are implicated in healing stomach infections and wounds and for inducing central nervous system (CNS) alterations when used during religious ceremonies. The _Iryanthera_ species are endemic to the Amazon region and their crushed leaves were reported to heal infected wounds and cuts. Also, the latex from the parks, mixed with warm water, was used for treating infections (_1_). The seeds of _Iryanthera_ species are valued in Brazil for their high yield in fatty acids, which also explains their general designation as \"ucu-uba\", or fat-producing tree. The protein-rich air and roasted seeds as well as beverages prepared from the crushed leaves of _Iryanthera_ are consumed by native people in the Amazon region. The major constituent in the seeds of _Iryanthera_ species is myristic acid, a C14 fatty acid. It usually co-occurs with antioxidant toci-triends and is extensively used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries (_2_). In the course of our systematic studies on _Iryanthera_ species, we have demonstrated the presence of antioxidant tocientionds, flavonoids, and flavonoligans in fruits and leaves of _Iryanthera grandis_, _Iryanthera lancifolia, Iryanthera saggiana_, and _Iryanthera juruensis_ (_3_-_7_).\n\nOxidative damage to the cell membrane and its components is the initial event in several human disease processes, including cancer and atherosclerosis. _Iryanthera_ spp. are known for their health benefits and hence we have continued the search for natural antioxidants in this plant species. It is a popular notion that regular consumption of antioxidant compounds imparts beneficial effects to biological systems and that such compounds act as chemopreventive agents. It has been established that compounds with radical scavenging activity are beneficial to health since they induce detoxifying enzymes (_8_, _9_).\n\nAs part of ongoing projects aimed at the discovery of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora [Biota-FAPESP (www.biotasp.org.br) and BIOprospecTA (www.bioprospecta.org.br), the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of 56 plant extracts have been examined by means of in vitro assays measuring the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and\n\n## Page 2\n\ncyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, respectively. The methanol and hexane extracts of _I. juruensis_ leaves and seeds, respectively, were subjected to bioassay-directed chromatographic purification. This paper presents the comparative LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities of the pure isolates and of crude extracts along with commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxynisole (BHA), and vitamin E, as well as clinically used antiinflammatory agents aspirin and Celebrex. Also, this is the first report of flavones **1-5** from _I. juruensis_ and of the novel juruenolic acid (**8**).\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### General Experimental Procedures\n\nUV and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B and a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1750 spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR spectra [\\({}^{\\text{H}}_{\\text{i}}\\), \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\), correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiments] were measured on Varian NOVA (300 MHz) and VPK (500 MHz) instruments. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to residual proton signals of CDCl3 at 7.24 and DMSO-_d_d_d at 2.50. Coupling constants, \\(J\\), are in Hertz. \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\) NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to residual \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\) signals of CDCl3 at 77.0 and DMSO-_d_d_d at 39.5. Standard pulse sequences were employed for all 1D [\\({}^{\\text{H}}_{\\text{i}}\\), \\({}^{\\text{1C}}\\), and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)] and 2D (COSY, HMBC, and HMQC) NMR experiments. Mass spectra were recorded at the Michigan State University mass spectrometry facility on a JEOL HX-110 double-focusing mass spectrometer (Peabody, MA) operating in the positive ion mode for fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and high-resolution (HR) FABMS experiments.\n\nMerck silica gel (60 mesh size, 35-70 \\(\\mu\\)m) with particle size of 60 \\(\\mu\\)m was used for preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). For preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation, 250, 500, and 1000 \\(\\mu\\)m silica gel plates (Analtech, Inc., Newark, DE) were used. TLC plates were viewed under UV light at 254 and 366 nm or sprayed with 10% sulfuric acid solution.\n\nSolvents were of ACS reagent grade and were purchased from Spectrum Chemical Co. (Gardena, CA). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxylosynisole (BHA), a-tocopherol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Celebrex was a physician professional sample. 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-_sn_-glycerol-3-phosphocholine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and 3-[_p_(6-6phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatriyl]phenylpropionic acid was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were prepared in the Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals Laboratory (BSNP) from ram seminal vesicles and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2), from cloned insect cell lysate, respectively (12).\n\n### Plant Material and Extract Preparation\n\nLeaves and fruits of _I. juruensis_ were collected in Reserva do Mocampo, in the Amazon forest in January during the rainy season, and identified as _Iryanthera juruensis_ Warburg by botanist Nelson Rosa. A voucher specimen, ID 141860 MG, was deposited at the Herbrahim Joho Mura Pires at Museu Paranes Emilio Goedi (Belem, PA, Brazil). The dried and ground leaves (111 g) and seeds (53 g) were extracted separately with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol at room temperature, using 3 x 300 mL of each solvent for extraction of leaves and 3 x 130 mL of each solvent for extraction of seeds. Solvents were removed under vacuum by use of a rotary evaporator and afforded the crude extracts hexane (1.4 g), EtOAc (1.8 g), and MeOH (6.4 g) from leaves and hexane (13.5 g), EtOAc (14.1 g), and MeOH (3.3 g) from seeds.\n\n### Isolation of Constituents\n\nThe MeOH extract from the leaves of _I. juruensis_ (3.2 g) was stirred with CHCl3 and filtered to remove the precipitate (1.5 g). The CHCl3-soluble part of this extract was concentrated (1.7 g) and subjected to HPLC on silica gel. Euliton with hexane-acetone (H/A) solvent system under gradient conditions (H/B 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL; H/A 2:4, 200 mL; each; A/A 300 mL; A/A 3:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL; A/A 300 mL; A/A 3:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:2, 300 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL; A/A 300 mL; A/A 3:1, 100 mL; H/A 1:\n\n## Page 3\n\nextrusion (29 times) through a 100 nm pore size membrane. The final assay volume was 2 mL, consisting of 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of \\(N\\)-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-\\(N\\)-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer [50 mM HEPES and 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Trisi)], 200 \\(\\mu\\)L of 1 M NaCl, 1.64 mL of N2-spraged Millipore purified water, 20 \\(\\mu\\)L of test sample or DMSO (solvent control), and a 20-\\(\\mu\\)L aliquot of liposome suspension. Peroxidation was initiated by addition of 20 \\(\\mu\\)L of FcCl2* 4H2O (0.5 mM) to achieve a final concentration of 50 \\(\\mu\\)M Fe2+. The positive controls BHA, BHT, and co-tocopherol/vitamin E were tested at a final concentration of 10 \\(\\mu\\)M. Fluorescence was measured at 384 nm and monitored at 0, 1, and 3 min and every 3 min thereafter up to 21 min on a Turner model 450 digital fluorometer (Barnsstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA). The decrease of relative fluorescence intensity with time indicated the rate of peroxidation. Relative fluorescence (\\(F_{t}\\)/\\(F_{0}\\)) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence value at a given time \\(t\\) (\\(F_{t}\\)) by that at \\(t=0\\) min (\\(F_{0}\\)).\n\n_Cyclooxygenase Enzymes Inhibitory Assay._ COX-1 enzyme inhibitory assay was conducted with an enzyme preparation from ram seminal vesicles (ca. 0.46 mg of protein/mL in 30 mM Tris buffer, pH 7). COX-2 activity was determined by using a preparation from insect cell lysate and diluting with Tris buffer (pH 7) to give an approximate final concentration of 1.5 mg protein/mL (_12, 13_). COX assays were measured at 37 oC by observing the initial rate of O2 uptake with a micro oxygen chamber and electrode (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) attached to a YSI model 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instrument, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Each assay mix contained 0.6 mL of 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7), 1 mmol of phenol, and 17 \\(\\mu\\)g of hemoglobin. For each test compound (100 ppm) or standards in DMSO (10 \\(\\mu\\)L), activities were determined following a 2-10 min preincubation of samples with enzyme COX-1 or COX-2 (10-20 \\(\\mu\\)L) in the assay chamber. Celebrex (1.7 ppm) and aspirin (108 ppm) were used as positive controls in this assay. Different concentrations of standards used were due to their difference in inhibitory activities and also to achieve a uniform enzyme inhibition at 50%. Reaction was initiated by adding arachidonic acid (10 \\(\\mu\\)L of a 1.64 \\(\\mu\\)M solution). Data were recorded with Quicklog for Windows data acquisition software (Strawberry Tree Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have evaluated 158 Brazilian plant extracts by TLC for the presence of antioxidant compounds (unpublished data) by spraying the developed TLC plates with \\(\\beta\\)-carotene solution followed by exposure to natural light (_10_). The results indicated the presence of antioxidants in 56 extracts, based on the observation of persistent yellow spots after exposure of the plates to natural light (_10_). These 56 plant extracts were then evaluated for their LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities. On the basis of the bioassay results, the methanol and hexane extracts of _I. jurvenis_ leaves and seeds, respectively, were selected for the isolation of bioactive compounds. In summary, the chromatographic purification of the leaf-extract afforded 5-deoxy-flavones (**1\\(-\\)5**) and the seeds extract gave sargachromenol (**6**), sargaquinoic acid (**7**), the novel juruenoic acid (**8**), \\(\\omega\\)-aryalkanoic acids (**9a\\(-\\)c**), and guaiaacin (**10**).\n\nThe identification of isolates was based mostly on NMR, UV, and MS spectral analysis and comparison with literature data. Compounds **1\\(-\\)5** belonged to the class of flavones lacking a 5-oxy substituent, which was confirmed by the signal at ca. \\(\\delta\\) 7.90 (d, \\(J\\sim 8.0\\) Hz), assigned to H-5, in their \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra. The position of -OCH3 groups in flavones **3** and **4** was established by UV spectral analysis with NaOAc/MeOH and NaOMe/MeOH as shift reagents for determination of the substitution patterns in rings A (band I) and B (band II), respectively (_14, 15_). Also, the NMR data of these compounds were identical to the reported chemical shift values and further confirmed their identities. Therefore, compound **1** was identified as 7,4 -dimethoxyflavone and was formerly isolated from _Virola_, a widely occurring neotropical Myristicaceae genus (_16_), whereas compound **3** was identified as tithonine, previously isolated from _Tithonia_ (Asteraceae) (_17_). Compounds **2** and **4**, identified as fasciculiferin and farnisine, respectively, were reported from _Acacia fasciculifera_ and _Acacia farnesiana_ (Fabaceae) (_18, 19_). Similarly, compound **5** was identified as 7,4 -dihydroxyflavone, reported from _Pterocarpus marsupium_ (_20_).\n\nThe structures of sargachromenol (**6**) and sargaquinoic acid (**7**) were also confirmed by NMR and MS spectral analyses. These compounds have been isolated earlier from brown seaweeds from the genera _Sargassum_ and _Stipopodium_ (_21, 22_) and as repeated isolates from _I. jurvenis_ (_7_).\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum of compound **8** showed signals for four methyl groups on sp2 carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 1.59, 1.62, 1.68, and 2.13, which showed correlations to signals at \\(\\delta\\) 17.7, 15.8, 25.6, and 29.9, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. A triplet at \\(\\delta\\) 5.98, integrated for one proton, and a multiplet at \\(\\delta\\) 5.09 for two protons were observed in its \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR signal at \\(\\delta\\) 172.0, assigned to an a,\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carboxyl, and at \\(\\delta\\) 123.0, 130.0, 132.0, 135.0, and 145.6, assigned to olefinic carbons of an isoprene chain, suggested a partial structure similar to the side chain in compounds **6** and **7**. An\n\n## Page 4\n\nadditional signal at d 208.0, which showed HMBC correlation with the singlet at d 2.13 and the triplet at d 2.45, indicated a methyl-carbonyl-methylene moiety in the structure of **8** (**Figure 1**). Also, one quartet at d 2.60, two triplets at d 2.08 and 2.11, integrated for two protons each, and one multiplet at d 2.26, integrated for four protons, were assigned to the allyl-methylene protons. The HMBC correlation between H1 (d 2.26) and C1 (COOH, d 172.6), in addition to correlations of H8 (d 2.27) to C6 (d 130.6) and to C10 (C=O, d 208.8) indicated the position of -COOH moiety at C2. Additional COSY (**Figure 2**) and HMBC correlations led to the complete assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR signals (**Table 1**). HRFABMS and FABMS analysis showed peaks at 293.2116 [M + H+] and 585 [2M + H+], respectively, which confirmed the molecular formula as C18H2O3, whereas peaks at _m/z_ 69 and 165 in the FAB mass spectrum (positive ion mode) were assigned to the isopentemly (C6H9) moiety and to the ion resulting from the loss of isopentyl and carboxyl moieties [M - C3H9 - COOH]+, respectively. Therefore, the spectral data gave conclusive support to the establishment of the structure of the new compound **8** as 2-(4-methylpentyl-3)-10-oxonadecan-2,6-dienoic acid.\n\n_o_-Arylalkanoic acids **9a-c** were identified on the basis of their UV, 1H and 13C NMR, and FABMS spectra and are probably biosynthetic precursors of g-lactones known as jurue-nolides, which occur widely in _Iryanthera_ species (_7_, _23_). Compound **10** was identified from its spectroscopic data and by comparison with literature values as guaiacin, an aryltetralin lignan, previously isolated from _Guaicanum officinale_ (Zygophylplaceae) (_24_, _25_).\n\nFlavonoids are by far the most investigated class of natural products regarding antioxidant properties. The aromatic -OH groups and the C2\\(-\\)C3 double bond are some of the features of flavonoids important for their antioxidant activity (_26_). Flavones **3-5** showed lipoperoxidation inhibition by 95% when tested at 100 ppm. At lower concentration (10 ppm), they were still highly active (**Figure 3**) and inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88%, respectively. This suggested that flavones **3-5** offer better protection of lipid membranes from oxidation than sargachromenol (**6**) or sargaunoioic acid (**7**).\n\nFlavones **1-5** also showed moderate inhibition of COX enzymes. However, the COX-1 enzyme was inhibited the most, by 40\\(-\\)65%, compared to COX-2 enzyme (**Figure 4**). At 100 ppm, flavones **1** and **2** inhibited COX-2 enzyme by 31% and 51%, respectively, whereas flavones **3-5** showed <20% inhibition. This activity profile might be dependent on their polarity as well as the substitution pattern in ring B. For example, flavones **1** and **2** are fully methylated compounds, whereas compounds **3-5** contained free -OH groups in their structures. Moreover, the substitution pattern in ring B seemed to play a major role in determining the COX-2 enzyme activity, as the presence of a 3, 4-dimethoxy ring B rendered the highest enzyme inhibitory activity among flavones **1-5** tested. Also, lack of a methoxy group in ring B led to a reduction in the activity as shown by flavone **5**. The presence of either a 7-OMe or 7-OH group in ring A seemed to be of lesser impact on COX-2 inhibition as shown by compounds **3** and **4**, which showed similar activities.\n\nIn previous studies, sargachromenol (**6**) was shown to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties that were assessed by electrochemical studies, by reaction with the stable free radical DPPH, and by inhibition of TPA-induced mouse ear edema (_7_, _27_). In this paper, we present additional support of the biological activity of _I. juruensis_ by demonstrating the ability of its isolates to inhibit LPO (76% at 100 ppm) (**Figure 3**) and COX-1 (98%) and COX-2 (84%) enzymes (**Figure 4**). In contrast, plastoquinone 7 exhibited poor inhibitory activities of LPO and COX-1 and -2 enzymes. This was probably due to\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} position & d0_μ_b_c_c_c_c_ & HMBC & HMOOCOSY \\\\\n1 & & 172.6 s & \\\\\n2 & & 135.5 s & \\\\\n3 & 5.981 (7.5) & 145.34 & C-5, C-2, C-1 & H-8 \\\\\n4 & 2.80 (7.5) & 28.11 t & C-6, C-5, C-3, C-2 & H-3, H-3 \\\\\n5 & 2.081 (7.5) & 39.0 t & C-7, C-4, C-3, C-2, C-12 & H-7, H-4 \\\\\n6 & & 130.6 s & & \\\\\n\n## Page 5\n\nthe lack of aromatic hydroxyls in its molecule and/or its oxidizing features associated with the quinone moiety. Poor inhibitory activities toward COX-1 and -2 enzymes were also observed for compounds **8** and **9**. In contrast, arylkalanoic acid **9** inhibited LPO by 79%, whereas compound **8** showed much lower ability to protect liposomes from oxidation (**Figure 3b**). Guaiacin (**10**) presented the highest LPO inhibitory activity (>95% at 100 ppm) among the tested compounds from _I. jurwensis_ fruits. This was probably due to the presence of two veratryl moieties in its structure, which may increase the hydrogen radical donating ability of the aromatic hydroxyl groups. It also strongly inhibited COX-1 (75% at 100 ppm) enzyme but showed weak activity toward COX-2 (<20% at 100 ppm).\n\nThe findings of our research on _I. jurwensis_ seeds and leaves have clearly shown that the plant parts studied possessed LPO inhibitory activity and were in agreement with the anecdotal reports. In addition, the moderate inhibition of COX-2 enzyme by extracts from seeds and leaves and the isolates from them further suggested the potential health beneficial effects of this plant and validated the ethno uses of _I. jurwensis_ decoction by Amazon Indians.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nWe thank Dr. D.

Ximenes, Mariana G. Lopes, Maicon Segalla Petronio, Luis Octavio Regasin, Dulce H. Siqueira Silva, Luiz M. da Fonseca\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe protective effect of gallic acid and its esters, methyl, propyl, and lauryl gallate, against _2,2'_-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH)-induced hemolysis and depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in erythrocytes was studied. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent, and the esters were significantly more effective than gallic acid. Gallic acid and its esters were compared with regard to their reactivity to free radicals, using the DPPH and AAPH/pyranine free-cell assays, and no significant difference was obtained. Gallic acid and its esters not only failed to inhibit the depletion of intracellular GSH in erythrocytes induced by AAPH but exacerbated it. Similarly, the oxidation of GSH by AAPH or horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in cell-free systems was exacerbated by gallic acid or gallates. This property could be involved in the recent findings on pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidant activities of gallates in tumor cells. We provide evidence that lipophilicity and not only radical scavenger potency is an important factor regarding the efficiency of anti-hemolytic substances.\n\nGallic acid; gallates; erythrocytes; hemolysis; glutathione; peroxyl radical; antioxidant; pro-oxidant activity\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nGallic acid and its derivatives are among the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in wines and green tea (_I_ - _3_). This phytochemical is well-known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and chemopreventive properties (_t_ - _7_). The similar beneficial effects of the synthetic esters of gallic acid have been extensively studied, and in many cases, they are stronger than those of gallic acid itself. For instance, lauryl gallate (dodecyl gallate), a widely used food additive, is more efficient than gallic acid as an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, and of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by FeIII-NADPH (_d_). Methyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid at inhibiting oral bacterial growth and the formation of _Streptococcus mutans_ biofilms (_4_). Methyl gallate inhibits the production of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2 by bone-marrow-derived mast cells (_th_). Nonyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid against the growth of _Salmonella choleraeus_ (_10_). Lauryl gallate protects against the formation of dimethylbenzanthracene-induced skin tumors in mice and kills, selectively, tumor cells in established tumors (_11_). Such biological activities have been correlated with the amphipathic feature of these ester derivatives (_12_), because the _in vitro_ antioxidant potential is nearly the same as that of gallic acid. Hence, it may be supposed that the accessibility of the gallates to the intracellular medium could be a determining factor for their effects.\n\nAnother relevant property of gallates is their pro-oxidant characteristics. Indeed, the cytotoxic effect of octyl, dodecyl, and tetracdexy gallates on melanoma cells has recently been demonstrated (_13, 14_). This biological effect has been associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of NF-_k_B, inhibition of cell adhesion, and alteration of the cell redox status by depletion of both glutathione (GSH) and ATP (_13_). Similarly, the inhibition of HeLa cell growth by propyl gallate was associated with depletion of intracellular GSH and increased production of the superoxide anion (_14_).\n\nThe hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an _ex vivo_ model for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced disruption of cell membranes and the protective effect of antioxidants. One of the most frequently studied models uses the water-soluble azo compound 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), which decomposes at physiological temperature (37 degC)\n\n## Page 2\n\nto generate an alkyl radical (R*). In the presence of dissolved molecular oxygen, this radical is converted to the corresponding peroxyl radical (ROO*) (_15_). The mechanism of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by thermolysis of AAPH is not completely understood, but it has been correlated with lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins (_16_). The incubation of erythrocytes with AAPH also provokes the depletion of intracellular GSH (_17_).\n\nBecause the above biological phenomenon is associated with the disruption of the cell membrane and in view of increasing evidence that the lipophilicity of gallic acid esters is decisive for their beneficial effects, here, we aimed to synthesize selected gallate esters and compare their efficacy as inhibitors of AAPH-induced hemolysis and GSH depletion. The objective was to retain the same oxidizable moiety while altering the lipophilicity. Additionally, we studied and compared the antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of gallic acid and gallates in cell-free systems.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Chemicals and Equipments.\n\nGallic acid, vanillic acid, methyl vanillate, (+-)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), _N_-ethylmaleimide (NEM), (+-)-a-tocopherol (vitamin E), 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), 5,5'-dithioish(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), glutathione (GSH), 8-hydroxypropyl-2,3,6-trisulfin acid trisulfin salt (pyramine), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picylhydrazyl (DPPH), \\(N\\),N_-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, amine hydroperoxide (Cu-OOH), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1), and _o_-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was prepared by diluting a 30% stock solution and calculating its concentration from its absorption at 240 nm (_ε_240 = 43.6 M-1 cm-1) (_18_). Column chromatography was carried out over 0.06-0.20 mm silica gel (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out in a Varian Prep-Star 400 system with a Phenomex C-18 (250 x 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Iowa 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz ('H) and 125 MHz ('C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-_d\n\n## Page 3\n\n37 degC. When present, apocynin, gallic acid, and gallates (100 _m_M) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 _ng_/mL catalase. The concentration of GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection, as previously described (2): For GSH determination, 50 _m_L of the above reaction mixture was added to 1.0 mL of 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. To a 20 _m_L aliquot of this mixture, 300 _m_L of 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0 and 20 _m_L of 0.1% OPA in methanol were added as this reaction mixture was incubated at 25 degC for 15 min in the dark in well-capped tubes, after which 20 _m_L of each sample was injected into the HPLC system. For GSSG determination, a 200 _m_L aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 degC with 200 _m_L of 40 mM NEM, for 25 min, in the dark, to react with the GSH present in the sample. To this mixture, 750 _m_L of 0.1 M NaOH was added. A 20 _m_L portion of this mixture was taken for measurement of GSSG, using the procedure outlined above for the GSH assay, except that 0.1 M NaOH was employed as the diluent rather than 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. The HPLC method for the determination of GSH and GSSG is based on derivatization with OPA to form a stable, highly fluorescent derivative (2). The derivatives of GSH and GSSG were separated by liquid chromatography (Varian ProStar in line with a fluorescence detector set at 350/420 nm). The analyses were carried out isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 _m_m). The mobile phase consisted of 15% methanol in 25 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 6.0 (flow rate of 0.5 mL/min).\n\n### Measurement of Oxygen Consumption.\n\nThe consumption of dissolved molecular oxygen during the oxidation of GSH was monitored in a YSI 5300A oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring, OH). The reaction mixture of 1 mM GSH, 100 _m_H2O2, and 0.1 _m_M HRP in PBS was incubated at 37 degC in the presence or absence (control) of 10 _m_M apocynin or gallates. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. The oxygen consumption was monitored for 10 min.\n\nPyranaine-Based Procedure for Evaluation of the Reactivity of Gallates with Peroxyl Radicals Generated by AAPH Thermolysis.\n\nThis experiment was performed as described by Lissi et al. (2_d_), with minor modifications. The experiments were based on the decay in the fluorescence of pyramine when it was submitted to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compound pyramine (5 _m_M) was incubated with 20 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 degC in the absence (control) or presence of gallates in the wells of a microplate. The fluorescence bleaching of the pyramine was monitored at _dx_= 460 nm and _x_= 510 nm in a Spectramax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The final reaction volume was 300 _m_L. The flag phase (induction time) obtained when the antioxidants were present was measured for various concentrations of each gallate. The slopes of the curves of induction time versus concentration were used to measure the relative reactivity of the gallates with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals.\n\n### Free-Radical Scavenging Activity on DPPH/DPPH Bleaching Assay.\n\nThe free-radical scavenger activity of gallic acid and its esters was compared by the DPPH bleaching assay (5). The antioxidants were incubated for 30 min with 100 _m_M DPPH in methyl alcohol in the dark. The scavenger activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm, using the absorbance of the unreacted DPPH radical as the control. The scavenger activity was calculated as ((absorbance of the control - absorbance of the sample)/absorbance of the control) x 100.\n\n## Results\n\nWe studied the hemolysis of erythrocytes and the protective effect of gallic acid and its esters. The molecular structures of the compounds studied are shown in **Figure 1**. Hemolysis was provoked by thermolysis of the azo compound AAPH, which generates a low but constant flux of peroxyl radicals when incubated at 37 degC (_15_). **Figure 2** shows the kinetic profile of hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid and propyl gallate. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent (Figure 3), and the esters methyl gallate (G1), propyl gallate (G3), and lauryl gallate (G12) were more effective inhibitors than their acid precursor, gallic acid (G0) (**Table 1**).\n\nBecause the above results suggest a higher efficacy of the esters as free-radical scavengers, we also compared their relative potency in cell-free models. First, they were compared as scavengers of the stable free-radical DPPH. The results depicted in **Table 2** show that no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its ester derivatives. In a second set of experiments, we studied the direct reactivity of gallic acid and its esters with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. In this assay, the relative reactivity of the antioxidants with peroxyl radicals is determined by the lag phase in the decay of pyramine fluorescence (2_d_). **Figure 4** shows the typical time profile of the bleaching obtained when pyramine was incubated with AAPH in the presence of gallic acid and methyl gallate. The linear relation between the delay and the concentration of gallic acid or gallates was used to measure the reactivity of the tested compound with AAPH. In this design, the slope of the curve is directly proportional to the efficiency of the antioxidant as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals. **Figure 4** also shows the typical linear correlation between the concentration and lag phase for gallic acid and methyl gallate. The slopes obtained were 442 +- 30 for gallic acid, 499 +- 31 for methyl gallate, 453 +- 6 for propyl gallate, and 187 +- 7 for lauryl gallate (mean +- SEM, \\(n\\) = 3). As can be observed, only lauryl gallate presented a\n\nFigure 1.: Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study.\n\nFigure 2.: AAPH-induced hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3). The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 °C. The results are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of duplicates of three separate experiments.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\ndecreased reactivity with peroxyl radicals in this experimental model.\n\nConsidering the above cell-free studies, the stronger antihemolytic effect of the gallates, relative to that of gallic acid, suggests that lipophilicity is a determining factor in this experimental model. To verify this proposal, we also compared the antioxidant vanillic acid versus its methyl ester (methyl vanillate) and trolox, a more water-soluble form of vitamin E, versus vitamin E itself. The results with these two different classes of antioxidants followed the same pattern as that for gallates and gallic acid, reinforcing the suggestion that lipophilicity of antioxidants is crucial with respect to antihemolytic protection (**Table 1**).\n\nThe direct hemolytic capacity of gallic acid and gallates was also investigated, because these compounds could interact with and disrupt the erythrocyte membrane. In these experiments, gallic acid and gallates were incubated with erythrocytes without AAPH. The results in **Table 3** show that only the 12-carbon ester lauryl gallate caused significant hemolysis after incubation for 6 h.\n\nThe protective effect of gallates was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis. The results given in **Table 4** show that gallates were also effective when the hemolysis was provoked by incubation of erythrocytes with cumene hydroperoxide. Again, there was a correlation with lipophilicity.\n\nIn a further experiment, the protective effect of gallic acid and gallates on the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by AAPH was also studied. Despite their antimobutyric properties, gallic acid and gallates were unable to inhibit the oxidation of GSH when erythrocytes were incubated with AAPH. On the contrary, the depletion of GSH was exacerbated by methyl and lauryl gallates (**Table 5**).\n\nTo clarify these findings, we studied the direct reaction between pure GSH and AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and tested the effect of gallic acid and gallates on this reaction. Again, the presence of gallic acid and gallates tended to exacerbate the oxidation of GSH (**Figure 5**).\n\nIn another set of experiments, pure GSH was oxidized by H2O3 in a reaction catalyzed by HRP. Because GSH is a poor substrate for peroxidase, the efficiency of oxidation was low (26). However, the addition of gallic acid and gallates caused a strong increase in the oxidation of GSH (**Figure 6**).\n\nIt is well-known that some phenolic compounds are able to act as a co-catalyst in reactions of inefficient peroxidase substrates, such as GSH. In such situations, the oxidized intermediate phenolic radical is reduced back and GSH is converted to GSSG. Moreover, during this redox cycle, the dissolved molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture is consumed, being reduced to superoxide anion (27). For these reasons and in light of our results, we measured the production of GSSG and the oxygen consumption as GSH was oxidized by HRP/H2O2 in the presence of gallic acid or gallates. To ascertain whether our experimental conditions for assessing the co-catalytic effect of phenols upon the oxidation of GSH was correct, we used apocynin, which is able to initiate this process, as a reference compound (28). As can be seen in **Figure 7**, both gallic acid and apocynin exacerbated the oxidation of GSH; however, only in the presence of apocynin was GSSG obtained as a product. Similarly, only in the presence of apocynin was the consumption of dissolved oxygen observed (**Figure 8**). The other gallates showed the same results as gallic acid (data not shown).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an _ex vivo_ model in the study of ROS-induced disruption of cell membranes. The inhibitory property of many antioxidants upon AAPH-induced hemolysis is well-documented (29-32). However, there is no clear relationship between the molecular structure of the antioxidants and their efficiency as inhibitors. Here, working with gallic acid and its ester derivatives, we found\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline experimental condition & percent hemolysis (3 h) & percent hemolysis (6 h) \\\\ \\(-\\)AAPH & \\(2 \\pm 1^{6}\\) & \\(3 \\pm 1^{6}\\) \\\\  & \\(17 \\pm 3^{6}\\) & \\(78 \\pm 7^{6}\\) \\\\  +G0 & \\(3 \\pm 2^{d}\\) & \\(72 \\pm 6\\) \\\\  +G1 & \\(3 \\pm 2^{d}\\) & \\(18 \\pm 5^{d}\\) \\\\  +G3 & \\(2 \\pm 1^{d}\\) & \\(9 \\pm 4^{d}\\) \\\\ +AAPH & +G12 & \\(\n\n## Page 5\n\nthat lipophilicity seems to be an essential characteristic of an efficient antihemolytic compound. Similar findings were reported by Wu et al. that ranked the antihemolytic efficiency of gallates as propyl > ethyl > methyl (_33_). Corroborating this proposal, the correlation between efficacy against AAPH-induced hemolysis and lipophilicity was not restricted to gallic acid and its ester derivatives but extended to other classes of molecules, such as vanillic acid versus its lipophilic derivative methyl vanillate and trolox versus vitamin E. Moreover, the benefit of lipophilicity was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis, because it was also seen when the erythrocytes were challenged with cumene hydroperoxide.\n\nReinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, our result showed clearly that higher antihemolytic efficacy of the gallates was not related to their oxidizability. Indeed, except for lauryl gallate, no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its esters in their potential as antioxidants in cell-free systems. Only the 12-carbon chain ester was relatively poor as a peroxyl radical scavenger in the cell-free systems. Despite that and again reinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, lauryl gallate was a more efficient inhibitor of hemolysis than gallic acid.\n\nIt is important to observe that any compound used as an antihemolytic agent when erythrocytes are challenged by free\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline experimental condition & percent hemolysis (2 h) \\\\ \\hline –Qu–OOH & & 8.1 ± 4.9a \\\\  & & 72.9 ± 1.6a \\\\  & 10 & 67 ± 1.7 \\\\  & +60 (_μM_) & 20 & 17 ± 6.9a \\\\  & +G1 (_μM_) & 10 & 11.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nradicals could also interact directly with the cell membrane and provoke its disruption. This effect has been described, and there is a relationship between lipophilicity and hemolytic capacity developed by many compounds [34, 35]. Accordingly, lauryl gallate, the most lipophilic compound used in this study, was the only ester capable of inducing hemolysis of erythrocytes under our experimental conditions.\n\nOther important findings include the interaction of gallic acid and gallates with GSH. This chemical feature could explain or be involved in the recent findings about cellular pro-oxidant effects of gallates [13, 14]. This tripeptide is the main endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) reflects directly the redox status of the cell [36]. It is well-known that redox homeostasis is crucial for cells to survive, and the pathophysiological mechanisms of several diseases are related to the exacerbated production of ROS and/or decreased antioxidant functions [37]. In fact, apoptosis, which is altered in tumor cells, strongly depends upon the GSH/GSSG ratio [38, 39]. Two pathways could explanation the exacerbated oxidation of GSH when gallates are present in the reaction mixture or cellular medium. The first is the action of these compounds as co-catalysts, where the intermediate phenoxyl radical would be reduced back to gallate with concomitant oxidation of GSH. This phenomenon is well-established for phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine and apocynin [27, 28], and the consequence of this redox cycle is the consumption of GSH, the formation of GSSG, and the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion [40]. This was exactly what we observed for apocynin, used as a model for a comparison to gallates in this study. However, when gallates were used, the consumption of GSH was not followed by the formation of GSSG and the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Hence, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for the augmented depletion of GSH caused by gallic acid and gallates.\n\nThe second possible explanation for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates in the depletion of intracellular GSH is a chemical reaction between the oxidized trihydroxybenzene moiety, probably in its quinone form, and GSH via the Michael\n\nFigure 5.: Oxidation of GSH by BAPH and effect of gallic acid and gallates.

This is a well-known reaction that involves electrophilic quinones and nucleophilic substances, such as GSH, leading to thiol adducts (_41_, _42_). In this case, the consumption of GSH is not followed by the formation of GSSG and oxygen consumption, as verified here. In summary, **Scheme 1** shows our proposal for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates when these compounds were oxidized in the presence of GSH, which could explain the depletion of intracellular GSH as verified here and by others (_13_, _14_).\n\n## Literature Cited\n\n* (1) Bertelli, A.

Biavatti, Paulo C. Vieira, M. Fatima G. F. da Silva, Joao B. Fernandes, Sergio Albuquerque\n\n# Abstract\n\nA phytochemicaln phytochemicaln'hypothylamine is a monospecific genus, and the species Raulinoa echinata Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic to the [tlajil'Valley, Santa Catarina, Brazil.1 This perennial woody shrub is characterized by the presence of spines and has been found only in a restricted location (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks of the tlajai River at an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing a high degree of adaptation to the environment. In continuation of our research on the chemistry of Raulino echinata,2,3 investigation of methanol extracts of stems and leaves has led to the isolation of the new 21a,25-dimethylmelanediol (1) and 21b,25-dimethylmelanediol (2) and also three new N-methylanthranilic acid esters of the gaharel-type compounds 3-5. In this work, the isolated compounds were also assayed in vitro against trypanosamiazyna (2002).\n\nThe hexane extract of the stems of R. echinata yielded the tritterpens melianone and melanediol, which exhibited spectral data in agreement with the literature.4,5 The hemiaetal ring of these compounds opens and doses in solution; thus, a mixture of epilmers is always present.\n\nFrom the methanol extract compounds of R. echinata stems 1 and 2 were obtained. As shown previously for melananone and melanediol, these compounds exhibited resonances in their 1H NMR spectra at ca. \\(b\\) 5.30 (brd, J = 3.0), ascribable to H-7, and seven singlets for quaternary methyl groups between \\(d\\) 0.82 and 1.25. Resonances at \\(d\\) 216.7, 145.6/145.3, and 118.1/118.0 were assigned to C-3, C-8, and C-7, respectively, in the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 2. In contrast to melananediol, two methoxy group signals were observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2. The side chain in each case was found to be the 21, 25-dimethyl analogue of melanediol, as verified by heteronuclear correlations of the methoxy groups with C-21 and C-25 in the HMBC spectra of 1 and 2. The HSQC spectra of compounds 1 and 2 showed correlations of the C-21 group resonances at \\(d\\) 109.7 and 104.7 with H-21 [at \\(d\\) 4.79 and 4.468 d (J = 3.4 Hz) for 1 and 2, respectively], characterizing them as C-21 primers. The H-23 [4.16 odd (J = 7.3, 5.4, 2.9 Hz)] and C-23 (_d_ 75.1) resonances, in addition to the H-24 (3.37 brd) and C-24 (_d_ 76.4) signals, showed correlations in the HSQC spectrum of compound 1. The isomer 2 showed the same correlations but inverted chemical shifts for C-23 (_d_ 77.8) and C-24 (_d_ 76.7).\n\nAdditional information was obtained by HMBC and NOE difference NMR experiments. In the HMBC spectra, correlations for C-25 (_d_ 77.2) and H-26/27 (_d_ 1.15 and 1.25) for compound 1, and at \\(d\\) 77.7 with 1.18 and 1.25 for compound 2, were observed. The H-18 (_d_ 0.82) signal in the HMBC spectrum of compound 1 correlated with C-21 (_d_ 31.1), C-13 (_d_ 43.6), C-14 (_d_ 51.0), and C-17 (_d_ 50.7). For compound 2, H-18 showed the same correlations, but the chemical shift of C-17 was upfield (_d_ 44.9). This differ one was attributed to a _y_-gauche effect of the oxygenated substituent on C-21b. Nakanishi et al.5 performed the X-ray crystallographic analysis of a melianone acetate analogue, comparing chemical shifts of _a_- and _b_-melanone acetates. According to their findings, C-21 exhibited downfield shifts and C-23 showed upfield shifts, in the C-21a either. These arguments were confirmed by NOE difference experiments for 1 and 2 (Table 3). In compound 1, irradiation of the\n\n## Page 2\n\nOMe-21 resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 3.34 gave an enhancement of the H-23 signal at \\(\\delta\\) 4.16. This enhancement was not observed for OMe-21 of compound 2. Accordingly, the structures of 1 and 2 were assigned as 21a,25-dimethylmalanoidl-[(21R,23R)epoxy-24-hydroxy-21a,25-methoxylirucalla-7-en-3-one and 21b,25-dimethylmalanoidl[(21S,23R)epoxy-24-hydroxy-21b,25-dimethoxylirucalla-7-en-3-one, respectively.\n\nCompound 3 exhibited a pair of doublets (one hydrogen each), at \\(\\delta\\) 0.49 (J = 5.0 Hz) and 0.74 (J = 5.0 Hz), in the COSY NMR spectrum. In the HSQC NMR spectrum, these hydrogens correlated with a methylene carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 13.4, indicating a 14,18-cydopaopunga skeleton. The side chain of compound 3 was assigned as a methyl melanoidl-type unit, as evidenced by resonances in the 'H NMR spectrum at 4.84 [(d, J = 3.0 Hz), H-21], 4.04 [(d, J = 10.2, 4.8, 2.0 Hz), H-23], 3.51 [(d, J = 5.0 Hz), H-24], and 3.36 s (OMe-21).6 The H-21 signal correlated in the HSQC spectrum with C-21 at \\(\\delta\\) 108.5, suggesting a C-21a-methoxy carbon, as in the case of 1.1 in the HMDC spectrum, H-21 correlated with C-23 (\\(\\delta\\) 77.6) and C-20 (\\(\\delta\\) 49.5), while H-23 and H-24 correlated in the HSQC spectrum with oxymethine carbons at 0 77.6 and 77.9, respectively. A broad singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 3.76 indicated a H-7b substituent,6 correlating in the HSQC spectrum with a carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 74.1. In the HMDC spectrum, the H-7b signal correlated with methylene carbons at \\(\\delta\\) 43.8 (C-9) and 46.1 (C-5). The former showed correlations with singlets attributed to H-30 (\\(\\delta\\) 1.03) and H-19 (\\(\\delta\\) 0.93); the latter correlated with H-28 and H-29 (\\(\\delta\\) 1.00/0.92), respectively. The HREIMS of compounds 3\\(-\\)5 revealed an odd molecular weight, in each case indicating the presence of nitrogen in these molecules. A 3_j_/N-methylanthranilate group was indicated in the 'H NMR spectra of compounds 3\\(-\\)5 by the resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 4.70 (dd, J = 11.1 and 5.0 Hz for 3 and 4; J = 10.3 and 5.8 Hz for 5) corresponding to H-3a, which correlated in their HSQC spectra with an oxymethine carbon (\\(\\delta\\) 80.4 +- 0.1). Compound 3 exhibited aromatic signals at \\(\\delta\\) 7.90 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.6 Hz), 7.31 (dd, J = 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz), 6.65 (brd, J = 8.0 Hz), and 6.58 (ddd, J = 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz). In addition, doublets at \\(\\delta\\) 7.70 (br, J = 4.6 Hz, N-H) and 2.90 (J = 4.6 Hz, N-Me) were observed in the COSY spectra, consistent with a N-methylanthranilic acid ester. Similar features were observed for compounds 4 and 5 (Table 1).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} position & t\\({}^{\\text{a}}\\) & 2\\({}^{\\text{a}}\\) & 3\\({}^{\\text{a}}\\) & 4\\({}^{\\text{a}}\\) & 5\\({}^{\\text{b}}\\) \\\\\n1 & 38.5 & 38.5 & 38.1 & 38.3 & 38.1 \\\\\n2 & 35.1 & 35.0 & 25.4 & 25.4 & 25.4 \\\\\n3 & 216.7 & 216.7 & 80.4 & 80.5 & 80\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe N-Me hydrogens correlated in the HMBC spectra of 3 with the quaternary carbon at \\(\\delta\\) 152.0 (C-3 ), which showed correlations with the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 7.90 (H-7 ) and 7.31 (H-5 ). The carbonyl C-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 168.2) correlated with H-7 (\\(\\delta\\) 131.3). In the COSY spectrum coupling between H-7 /H-6 and H-5 /H-4 was observed. Accordingly, compound 3 was assigned as (21R,23S)-epoxy-21a-methoxy-7a,24,25-trihydr oxy-4a,4b,8b,10b/tetramethyl-25-dimethyl-14,18-cy-d-5a,13a,14a,17a-cholestera-3b/N-methylanthranilic acid ester.\n\nCompound 4 differed from compound 3 only in the configuration of C-21, with chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra observed for the hydrogens of the side chain along with upfield changes for carbons C-21, C-17, and C-16, in agreement with a \\(\\beta\\)-configuration, as discussed earlier for 2. Compound 4 was assigned the structure (21R,23S)-epoxy-21a-methoxy-7a,24,25-trihydroxy-4a,4b,8b,10b/tetramethy1-25-dimethyl-14,18-cyd-5a,13a,14a,17a-cholestera-3b/N-methylanthranilic acid ester.\n\nCompound 5 was also assigned an N-methylanthranilic acid ester with a 14,18-cyd-oaqueounhane skeleton, but did not exhibit a methoxyl singlet in the 'H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance was observed downfield (\\(\\delta\\) 5.28) when compared to the methoxylated derivatives 3 and 4. Additionally, the signals for the side chain of compound 5 were duplicated in the 'H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance showed a second doublet (of minor intensity) at \\(\\delta\\) 5.32, multiplets at \\(\\delta\\) 4.40 and 4.23 attributed to H-23, and doublets at \\(\\delta\\) 3.58 and 3.13 assigned to H-24. These observations strongly suggested that 5 is a C-21 hydroxyl derivative, isolated as an epimeric mixture,6,7 As for compounds 1-4, compound 5 was finally elucidated by a series of 2D NMR experiments, including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. NMR spectral data for compounds 1-5 are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the main H-C correlations in the long-range HMBC spectrum of 5. Thus, the structure of 5 was assigned as (21,23S)-epoxy-7a,21,-24,25-tetrahydroxy-4a,4b,8b,10b/tetramethy1-25-dimethyl-14,18-cyd-5a,13a,14a,17a-cholestera-3b/N-methylanthranilic acid ester.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nHalf of the MeOH extract of the leaves (100 g) was submitted to liquid partition with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH.

These data, analyzed with their corresponding 13C NMR data (Table 2), and further information from ESI-MS/MS (m/z 405), and analogues published in the literature,10 suggested a xanthone skeleton linked to a caffeoyl-glucose moiety for compound 1.

The unusual downfield chemical shift of the H-2 signal suggested an acyl moiety at C-2,12 which was corroborated by the values from C-1, C-2, and C-3 (Table 2) and observation of a cross-peak between the H-2 and C-9 (_d_ 168.3) signals in the HMBC spectrum.

The antifungal activity of these compounds was evaluated by bioautographic TLC assay against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphareospermum_.\n\nPapercase species have been extensively investigated as a source of new natural products with potential anti-tumoral, antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal activities.1-3 The phytochemical profile in _Piper_ species is characterized by the production of typical classes of compounds such as amides, benzoic acids, and chromenes in addition to ligaments, neoligans, and a few alkaloids.4-6\n\nAs part of our research aiming to uncover new antifungal compounds in Brazilian Piperaceae species, we have previously reported the occurrence of pyrrolidine amides in _P. hispidum_7 and piperidine, isobutyl, and pyrrolidine amides in _P. tuberculatum_8 and _P. arboreum_.9 Additionally, anti-fungal preyniled hydroquinones and flavances from leaves of _P. crassinervium_10 have been described as well. The search for new antifungal compounds will contribute to establish a model for further investments in this field in order to preserve, to study, and to exploit rationally the remaining flora of Sao Paulo State.\n\nIn the course of the Biota Program ([http://www.biota.sp](http://www.biota.sp)), a large number of _Piper_ species collected in the state of Sao Paulo had their extracts assayed by means of bioautography using _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ (Fresen) de Vries and _C. sphareospermum_ (Perzig). Since the extracts of _Piper crassinervium_ Kunth, _P. aduncum_ L., _P. hostmannianum_ (Miquel) C. DC., and _P. gaudichaudianum_ Kunth showed high growth inhibitory activity, they were subjected to dereplication procedures using chromatographic techniques associated with the bioautographic assay. Thus, the major aim of this paper is to describe the isolation and structural determination of the new antifungal compounds from Piperaceae species.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe MeOH extract from leaves of _P. crassinervium_ yielded three prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acids [4-hydroxy-3-(3, 7-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-1-oxo-6-oetenyl)benzoic acid (crassinervic acid, 1), 4-hydroxy-(3, 7-dimethyl-1-oxo-octa-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (2), and 4-hydroxy-(3, 7-dimethyl-1-oxo-octa-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid12 (3,4,5-trimethoxydihydrocinnamic acid12 (4), 1,4-dihydroxy-2-(3, 7-dimethyl-1-oxo-octa-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzene10 (5), and two flavanones [5,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxyflavanone13 (naringenin 4-methyl ether, 6) and 5,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-flavanone14 (sakuranetin, 7)].\n\nThe CH2Cl2- and hexane-soluble parts of the MeOH extract of the leaves of _P. aduncum_ yielded one new prenylated benzoic acid [methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3-methyl-1-oxo-2-butenyl)benzoate (aduncumene, 8)], four known chromenes [methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (9), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (11), and 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid15,16 (12)], 4-methoxy-3-(3, 7-dimethylocta-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), and two dihydrechalcone [2,6-dihydroxy-4-methyl-oxdithydrochalcone15 (14) and piperaduncine B17 (15)].\n\nThe CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves of _P. hostmannianum_ yielded methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), three prenylated methyl hydroxybenzoate derivatives [methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)benzoate18,19 (16), methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-hydroxy-3-butenyl)benzoate16 (17), and the new derivative methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-2-3)-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)benzoate (hostmannienne, 18)], and pinoembrin20,21 (19).\n\nThe CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves and roots of _P. gaudichaudianum_ yielded two chromenes [2-methyl-2-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (gaudichaudianic acid, 20) and methyl 2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (21)], three prenylated benzoic acids [4-methoxy-3-(3, 7-dimethylocta-2-E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), 4-hydroxy-3-(3, 7-dimethylocta-2-_E-6-dienyl)benzoic acid23 (22), and methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-1-oxo-2-butenyl)benzoate24 (methyl taboangante, 23)], and pinoembrin20,21 (19).\n\nCompound **1** was isolated from the leaves of _P. crassinervium_ as a white amorphous solid. Its molecular formula was established as C17:H2O5 by analysis of its HREIMS spectrum (_m/z_ 306.1459, called 306.1467). The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3380 cm-1), two carbonyl groups (1696, 1611 cm-1), and an aromatic ring (1489, 1421 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited signals\n\n## Page 2\n\nfor three aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.93 (d, \\(J\\) = 8.9 Hz), 8.11 (dd, \\(J\\) = 8.9 and 2.4 Hz), and 8.56 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.4 Hz), indicative of a 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. Additional signals included three methyl singlets (_d_ 1.37, 1.50, 1.58), two doublets at \\(d\\) 2.77 (1H, \\(J\\) = 16.5 Hz) and 2.64 (1H, \\(J\\) = 16.5 Hz), characteristic of an isolated \\(\\alpha\\)-carbonyl methylene group, and a triplet at \\(d\\) 4.98 (1H, \\(J\\) = 7.2 Hz), indicating the presence of a double bond in the side chain. The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEDT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) showed signals for 17 carbon atoms assigned as two carbonyl (_d_ 191.5, 170.6), six aromatic (_d_ 163.7, 137.3, 129.9, 122.1, 119.9, 118.8), two olefinic (_d_ 132.5, 122.9), three methyl (_d_ 25.6, 23.9, 17.5), one tertiary carboninic (_d_ 82.3), and three aliphatic methylene carbons (_d_ 47.2, 39.3, 22.2). The assignments of the signals for aromatic carbons were based on comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data reported for known benzoic acids analogues.11 The connectivity between aromatic and aliphatic moieties was revealed by analysis of the HMDC spectrum. The correlations between signals at \\(d\\) 8.56 (H-2)/2.77 (H-2)/2.64 (H-2 b) with 191.5 (C-1 ) as well as between \\(d\\) 8.56 (H-2)/8.11 (H-6) with 170.6 (CO2H) (Figure 1) indicated that compound **1** contains one carbonyl group at C-1 and one carboxyl group attached to C-1. The double bond at the side chain was assigned on the basis of the observed cross-peaks between \\(d\\) 4.98 (H-6 ) and 25.6 (C-8 )/17.5 (C-9 ) in the HMDC spectrum and between signals at \\(d\\) 4.98 (H-6 ), 2.03 (H-5 ), 1.58 (H-8 ), and 1.50 (H-9 ) in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Thus, the hydroxyl group on a tertiary carbon atom was placed at C-3  of the side chain, in agreement with the HMDC correlations observed between the hydrogen signals at \\(d\\) 2.77 (H-2 a)/2.64 (H-2 b), 1.70 (H-4 ), and 1.37 (H-10 ) with the carbon signal at \\(d\\) 82.3 (C-3 ). Analysis of the DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMDC NMR spectra allowed full assignment for all hydrogen and carbon atoms, and thus, the structure of exrasineric acid (**1**) was elucidated as 4-hydroxy-3-(3, 7 -dimethyl-3 -hydroxy-1 -oxo-6 -octenyl)benzoic acid.\n\nCompound **8** was isolated from the leaves of _P. aduncum_ as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula C14H16O4 was determined by LRESIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 1700, 1610, and at 1445 cm-1, assignable to two carbonyl groups and aromatic double bonds, respectively. The structure of the premylated benzoic acid derivative was recognized by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum, which showed signals at \\(d\\) 8.18 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.9 Hz), 8.06 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 8.5 and 1.9 Hz), and 6.93 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.5 Hz). This spectrum also showed a set of signals including two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.96 (3H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.5 Hz)/2.20 (3H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.5 Hz) and a multiplet at 6.53 (1H), which are characteristics of an isoprene unit, and additionally, two methoxyl groups at \\(d\\) 3.90 (3H, s) and 3.86 (3H, s). The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEDT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) exhibited, in the low-field region, one carbonechloronyl group at \\(d\\) 166.6, six aromatic carbons at \\(d\\) 161.2, 134.1, 132.0, 131.2, 122.9, 111.4, and two signals corresponding to the double-bond carbons at \\(d\\) 125.1 (CH) and 156.7 (C). These two signals, associated with the carbonyl signal at \\(d\\) 192.7, indicated an \\(a\\),_b_/unsaturated carbonyl system.22,25\\({}^{\\circ}\\) The high-field region exhibited signals assignable to two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 28.3 and 21.6 and two methoxyl groups at \\(d\\) 52.5 and 56.2. The assignment of all signals observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of **8** was corroborated by HMQC and HMDC experiments (Figure 1). The HMDC spectrum showed the correlation of the signal at \\(d\\) 192.2 (C-1 ) with the hydrogens at \\(d\\) 8.18 (H-6), 8.06 (H-4), and 6.53 (H-2 ) and between \\(d\\) 166.6 (C-6 ) and 8.18 (H-6) and also with 3.86 (OCH3). Finally, the cross-peaks observed between \\(d\\) 156.7 (C-3 ) and 2.20 (H-4 ) and 1.96 (H-5 ) confirmed the structure of **8** as methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3 -methyl-1 -oxo-2 -butenyl)benzoate, named aduncumene.\n\nCompound **18** was obtained from the leaves of _P. host-mannianum_, as a white amorphous powder. Its LRESIMS data associated with 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) and elemental analysis indicated a molecular formula of C13H18O5. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3463 cm-1), an aromatic ring (1613, 1440 cm-1), and a carbonyl group (1715 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals assignable to three coupled aromatic hydrogens at \\(d\\) 6.76 (d, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz), 7.72 (dd, \\(J\\) = 9.0 and 2.0 Hz), and 7.77 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz), characteristic of the 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. In addition, this spectrum displayed three singlets at \\(d\\) 1.27 (3H), 1.30 (3H), and 3.80 (3H) assigned, respectively, to two methyl groups attached to an oxygen-bearing carbon and to one methoxyl group. The presence of an oxymethine hydrogen at \\(d\\) 3.77 (dd, \\(J\\) = 6.0 and 4.5 Hz), associated with the signals at \\(d\\) 3.02 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 17.0 and 4.5 Hz) and 2.73 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 17.0 and 6.0 Hz), suggested a hydroxylated isoprene side chain at C-3 of the benzoic acid nucleus. The HMDC spectrum of **18** (Figure 1) showed correlation between the signals at \\(d\\) 31.1 (C-1 ) and 7.77 (H-2), between \\(d\\) 69.2 (C-2 ) and 1.27 (H-4 /1.30 (H-5 )/0.2 (H-1 a)/2.73\n\n## Page 3\n\n(H-1 b), between d 25.0 (C-4 ) and 1.30 (H-5 ), and between d 22.0 (C-5 ) and 3.77 (H-2 J/1.27 (H-4 ), confirming the positioning of the vicinal hydroxyl groups at C-2 and C-3. The methoxy group was determined as a methyl ester, considering that a cross-peak between the signals at d 166.9 (C-6 ) and 3.80 (OCH3) was observed in the HMBC spectrum. Therefore, the structure of **18** was determined as methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2, 3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)benzoate, named homaminase.\n\nCompound **20** was isolated from the leaves of _P. gaudiachaadium_ as an amorphous solid. The molecular formula C22H28O3 was deduced by LREIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3500, 1681, and 1601 cm-1 assignable to a hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic ring, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at d 5.58 (1H, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz) and d 6.38 (1H, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz) and four singlets at d 1.41 (3H, s), 1.67 (3H, s), 1.56 (3H, s), and 1.73 (6H, s), which were associated with the chrome/isoprene moieties.15,27 Two low-field doublets at d 7.59 (1H, \\(J\\) = 2.1 Hz) and 7.75 (1H, \\(J\\) = 2.1 Hz), assignable to the _meta_ aromatic hydrogens, indicated a 3,4,5-trisubstituted benzoic acid derivative, which was corroborated by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. A carboxyl group, with a signal at d 172.1, was placed between the two aromatic hydrogens (C-6). The chrome moiety was confirmed by the presence of signals at d 79.9, 129.5, and 121.9 assignable to the carbons C-2, C-3, and C-4, respectively.27 The DEPT 135deg spectrum confirmed these previous assignments and showed the presence of three methylenes at d 41.9 (C-1 ), 22.7 (C-2 ), and 28.2 (C-1 ), which were associated with the respective protons at d 1.78 (H-1 ), 2.25 (H-2 ), and 3.28 (H-1 ) by means of the HMQC spectrum. The linkage positions of the two isoprene side chains to the chrome/aromatic ring were determined by an HMBC experiment (Figure 1), in which correlations between the signals at d 128.9 (C-8) and 5.28 (H-2 ), between d 131.8 (C-7) and 3.28 (H-1 ), between d 41.9 (C-1 ) and 1.41 (H-9), and between d 123.9 (C-3) and 1.78 (H-1 ) were observed. Thus, the complete assignments of NMR data of **20** were made by analysis of HMQC and HMBC data and by comparison with those obtained for similar compounds isolated from _P. hothzkyanum_ and _P. aduncum_.11,28 Therefore, the structure of **20** was determined as 2-methyl-2-(4 -methyl-3 -pentenyl)-8-(3 -methyl-2 -butenyl)-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid, named gaudiachaudinic acid. The optical rotation, [a]25D +21 (_c_ 0.1, CHCl3), was similar to that observed for sargatridi,29 but this compound has two additional chiral carbons (C5 and C6 ) in its side chain and is not appropriate for a direct comparison. Nevertheless, the CD curve obtained for **20** was fully opposite to that described for sargatrid including the positive Cotton effect at 260-280 nm (styrene chromophore). Thus, despite the differences in the substitution pattern in the aromatic ring for **20**, the \\(S\\) configuration at C-2 was suggested.\n\nThe antifungal activities of compounds **1**-**23** isolated from these four _Piper_ species were evaluated against _C. caldosoprioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ (Table 1). The fungitoxic potential for the compounds **5**, **6**, **7**, **17**, **19**, and **21** has been previously reported.10,22,26,27 As can be seen, the chromene **9**, crassinervic acid (**1**), and hostmaniane (**18**) showed high potential as antifungal compounds and should be further evaluated against other fungi. Several compounds, **2**, **3**, **5**, **7**, **16**, and **19**, showed potency (1.0 _m_g) similar to that of the control. In the prenylated benzoic acid series (**1**-**3**) the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the side chain, as in the case of **1**, doubled the activity, while the changes in the double-bond configuration (**2** and **3**) did not cause significant improvement.\n\n### Experimental Section\n\n**General Experimental Procedures.** Optical rotations were measured on a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeter (Na filter, \\(l\\) = 588 nm) and CD spectrum in CHCl3 with a JASCO ORDUV-6 spectropolarimeter. IR spectra were measured in REPL pellets on a Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrometer model 1750. UV spectra were recorded on a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer using MeOH as solvent. LREIMS and HREIMS spectra were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/5988 A and a VG Autospee spectrometer, respectively, while LREIMS spectra were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. 'H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 500/300 and 125/75 MHz, respectively, on Bruker DRX-500 and Bruker DPX-300 spectrometers. CDCl3 (Aldrich) was used as solvent and TMS as internal standard. Chemical shifts were reported in \\(o\\) units (ppm) and coupling constants (_J_) in Hz. Elemental analyses were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer elemental analyzer model 2400 CNH. silica gel (Merck, 230-400 mesh) and Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma) were used for column chromatographic separations, while silica gel 60 PF254 (Merck) was used for analytical\n\nFigure 1.: Key HMBC correlations observed for compounds **1**, **8**, **18**, and **20**.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nTLC (0.25 mm), preparative TLC (1.0 mm), and circular chromatography (4.0 mm).

The resulting solution was partitioned between hexane and EtOH-H2O (8:2) to yield the hexane-soluble solution. The EtOH-H2O solution was extracted with CH2Cl2, yielding a CH2Cl2-soluble solution (14.9 g), which was applied to a silica gel column and eluted with hexane containing increasing volumes of EtOAc, yielding 19 fractions (1-19).

The air-dried and powdered leaves from _P. aduncum_ (300 g) were extracted with EtOAc three times (3 x 1 L). The resulting extract (28.3 g) was dissolved in CHCl2 (100 mL) and partitioned with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (3 x 50 mL). The NaHCO3 solution was neutralized with HCl (6 M), extracted with EtOAc (3 x 50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated, yielding 764 mg of residue. This residue was applied to a silica gel column and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc, yielding five fractions (1-5).

Part of the extract from the leaves (4.5 g) was suspended in MeOH-H\\({}_{2}\\)O (8.5:1.5), filtered in a bed of Celite, and concentrated in vacuo to yield 2.5 g of the chlorophyll-free leaves extract. This extract was subjected to fractionation on a silica gel column using hexane with increasing amounts of EtOAc as eluent, yielding 15 fractions (1-15).

Part of the crude CH2Cl2-MeOH extract from leaves (0.9 g) was dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL) and partitioned with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (3 x 50 mL). The NaHCO3 fraction was neutralized with HCl (6 M), extracted with EtOAc (3 x 50 mL), and dried over Na2SO4, yielding a residue (20 mg). This residue was subjected to preparative TLC hexane-EtOAc, 9:1, three elutations, yielding **13** (4 mg) and **22** (7 mg). Part of the extract from roots (245 mg) was separated by circular chromatography (layer of 4 mm) and eluted with hexane with increasing amounts of EtOAc, yielding **23** (77 mg) and **21** (35 mg).\n\nCrassinervic acid [4-hydroxy-3(3,7 -dimethyl-3-hydroxy-1-oxo-6-octomethyl)benzoic acid] (1) was obtained as a white amorphous solid: [40]\\({}^{\\mathrm{2s}}\\) (50-6 T) (0.515, CHCl2); UV (MeOH) _l_max (mg ) 262 (3.90), 320 (3.28) nm; IR (KBr) _v_max 3380, 1696, 1611, 1489, 1421 cm\\({}^{-1}\\); 1H NMR (CDCl2, 500 MHz) \\(d\\) 8.56 (1H, d \\(J\\) = 2.4 Hz, H2.0), 6.93 (H1, d \\(J\\) = 9.9 Hz, H-5), 8.11 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 8.9, 2.4 Hz, H-6).27 (1H, d \\(J\\) = 16.5 Hz, H-2 a), 2.64 (1H, d \\(J\\) = 16.5 Hz, H-2 b), 1.70 (2H, m, H-4 ), 2.03 (2H, m, H-5), 4.98 (1H, d \\(J\\) = 2.2 Hz, H-6), 1.58 (3H, br, h-8), 1.50 (3H, br, s-9), 1.37 M(1, s-1,0), 12.3 (1H, s, OH); 3C NMR (CDCl2, 125 MHz) (119.9 C,(C-1), 129.9 C,(C-2), 122.1 (C, C-3), 163.7 (C, C-4), 118.8 (CH, C-5), 137.3 (CH, C-6), 191.5 (C, C-1), 4.72 (CH2, C-2), 23.6 (C, C-3), 3.93 (CH2, C-4), 22.2 (CH2, C-5), 122.9 (CH2, C-6), 132.5 (C, C-7), 25.6 (CH2, C \n\n## Page 6\n\n* (22) Terreaux, C.; Gupta, M.

The structures of the new alkaloids were established on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis, mainly 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as high-resolution HRESIMs. Alkaloid 3 showed strong free-radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picylhydrazyl (DPPH) as well as pronounced anti-oxidant activity evidenced by redox properties measured by EICD-HPLC. Additionally, alkaloids **1-9** were submitted to TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Both **7** and **8** were shown to be moderate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors at a concentration of 0.1 and 1.0 _m_M, respectively. In an in vitro rat brain assay, **7** showed moderate activity (IC50 1.86 _m_M), compared to the standard compound, galanthamine (IC50 0.92 _m_M).\n\n## Introduction\n\n### _Chimarrhis turbinata_\n\nThe study of the _Chimarrhis turbinata_ was performed by the Swiss National Institute of Standards and Technology (NSF), who was performed in a 1980s to 1980s. The study of the _Chimarrhis turbinata_ was performed by the Swiss National Institute of Standards and Technology (NSF), who was performed in a 1980s to 1980s.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n(Figure 1). COSY and NOESY experiments were fundamental to assign the relative configuration of C-15, C-20, and C-21 of this alkaloid, which was inferred to have the same stereochemistry as strictosidine. The structure of **1** was thus defined as 3,4-dehydro-strictosidine.\n\nCompound **2** was obtained as a pale yellow amorphous powder. HRESINGS analysis gave a protonated molecular ion [M + H]+ peak at _m/z_ 515.2056, corresponding to the molecular formula C28H30N2O9. The IR spectrum showed absorptions at _v_max 3440 and 3368 cm-1, indicating the presence of -OH and -NH fractions, respectively. Inspection of the NMR data (1H, 13C, DEPT, and 2D experiments) showed a structure similar to **1**, including also a glucose moiety, confirmed by the ESIMS fragment ion at _m/z_ 353.1596 [M - Glc + H]+ and NMR data. The only difference in the 'H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) of alkaloid **2** was the absence of signals corresponding to a methoxyl group (_th_ = 3.69, _d_C = 53.0), which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid function, corroborated by the signal at \\(d\\) 175.0 (C=O) and the IR absorption at 3440 cm-1 assigned to the carboxylic hydroxy group. HMBC cross-peaks (Figure 1) confirmed the 'H and 13C NMR assignments, and the proposed structure for compound **2** as the new 3,4-dehydro-strictosidine acid.\n\nCompounds **3**-**6** were identified as cordioline,7 strictosidine acid,8 strictosidine,8 and 5a-carboxystrictosidine,8 respectively, after comparison of their NMR spectral data with reported values. Compound **7** was previously isolated from this plant.3 The _b_-carboline alkaloids **8** and **9** were identified as desoxycordifoline7 and harman-3-carboxylic acid,9 respectively. After careful analysis of the literature, 13C NMR data for compounds **3** and **9** were found to be unpublished and thus these data are included in Table 2.\n\nCompounds **1**-**9** were tested toward the DPPH radical (Table 3).10 Alkaloid **3** showed strong scavenging activity against the DPPH radical (IC50 18.3 _m_g/mL) using the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 12.3 _m_g/mL) as reference,\n\n## Page 3\n\nwhereas all other isolated alkaloids showed moderate to weak activity (IC \\(>\\) 40 \\(\\mu\\)M). This result indicates that the free-radical scavenging activity of this indole alkaloid is due to its higher hydrogen-donating ability (to DPPH), provided by the hydroxy group at C-10, which results in a more efficient radical-scavenging effect.11 The electrochemical behavior displayed by these alkaloids showed a good correlation with the radical-scavenging effect measured in the DPPH assay, which clearly indicates that substances with oxidative peaks above +1.2V (Table 3) and a small oxidative capacity have weaker radical-scavenging properties than those that are oxidized at lower potentials.12 Compounds **1**-**9** were submitted to preliminary TLC screening for selecting potential AchE inhibitors,13 in which only compounds **7** and **8** inhibited the enzyme at 0.1 and 1.0 \\(\\mu\\)M concentrations. Due to the limited amount of alkaloid **8**, only compound **7** was submitted to further evaluation in an in vitro rat brain assay, to measure its AchE inhibitory potential, and showed a moderate activity (IC50 1.86 \\(\\mu\\)M) when compared with the standard galan-thaming (IC50 0.92 \\(\\mu\\)M).\n\n### Experimental Section\n\n**General Experimental Procedures.** Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter in MeOH at 25 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, using a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 1degC (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as internal standard. ESIIMS were obtained on a VG Platform Fisons instrument, and HRTOF-ESIMS-MS was performed using a Q-TOF (Micromass) (40 eV) instrument. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-4 (Sigma-Aldrich), and Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia). TLC was performed using silica gel 60 (Merck, \\(\\mu\\) = 230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF54 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C and/or Dragonedorff reagent. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C18 (250 mm x 21,20 mm, Luna-Phenomenex) columns.\n\n**Plant Material.** Authenticated _Chimarrthis turbinata_ DC. was collected in Reserva do Viro, Belem, PA, Brazil, in February 2000 and identified by Dr. Marina Therera V. do A. Campos. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo (Voucher No. Lopes-51).\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** Air-dried bark and leaves from _C. turbinata_ were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. Both ethanolic extracts were dissolved in MeOH-H2O 80% and partitioned with EtOAc and _n_-BuOH. The _n_-BuOH fraction (12.3 g) after solvent evaporation was dissolved into H2O (5 mL) and submitted to filtration over XAD-4 eluted with H2O, MeOH-H2O (20 -100% gradient), acetone, MeOH-CH2Cl2 (1:1), CH2Cl2, and Et2O. The subtractions obtained (A-K) were compared by TLC and revealed with specific reagents to alkaloids (Dragendorff). Fractions A (5.0 g), B (700.00 mg), and C (253.0 mg) were purified. Fraction A was submitted to VLC (vacuum-liquid chromatography) using octadecylsilane silica and gradient elution of decreasing polarity with H2O, MeOH, acetone, and CH2Cl2 to give seven fractions. Fraction A (468.00 mg) was purified by HPLC using MeCN-H2O-AcOH\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline carbon & **1** & **2** & **3** & **9** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & & & & 136.1 s \\\\\n2 & 135.2 s & 136.2 s & 137.2 s & \\\\\n3 & 138.5 s & 148.0 s & 141.9 s & 141.7 s \\\\\n4 & & & & 115.4 d \\\\\n4a & & & & 127.0 s \\\\\n4b & & & 121.3 s \\\\\n5 & 48.2 t & 48.0 t & 136.8 s & 122.1 d \\\\\n6 & 28.0 t & 16\n\n## Page 4\n\n(15:84.5:0.5) as mobile phase, UV detection at 237 nm, and a flow rate of 12 mL min-1 and afforded 5a-carboxynitrosidine (**6**) (5.0 mg). Fraction B (700.0 mg) was dissolved into MeOH and submitted to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 23 fractions (B1-B23). After TLC comparison, fractions B13-B15 were combined (90 mg) and purified by HPLC using MeCN-H2O-AcOH (15:84.5:0.5) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 237 nm and a flow rate of 12 mL min-1, affording the new derivative (1.5 2 mg).\n\nThe ethanolic fraction (1.5 g) was purified by semipreparative HPLC using MeCN-H2O-AcOH (15:84.5:0.5) as mobile phase, UV detection at 237 nm, and a flow rate of 12 mL min-1, to afford the new derivative **2** (17.0 mg) and the known compounds **9** (30.0 mg), **3** (24.6 mg), **6** (154.1 mg), and **8** (148.9 mg).\n\nThe aqueous fraction from the bark (10 g) was submitted to RP-18 VLC eluted with decreasing polarity elements as indicated above to give seven fractions. Fraction 1 (9 g) was purified by semipreparative HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (15:84.5:0.5); UV detection at 237 nm; flow rate 12 mL min-1], affording compounds **4** (15.0 mg), **5** (20.0 mg), and **6** (15.0 mg) and two unresolved peaks (A, retention time 19.9 min; B, retention time 50.7 min). Fraction A (28 mg) was further purified by semipreparative HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (13: 86.5:0.5); UV detection at 254 nm; flow rate 12 mL min-1], affording **3** (16.4 mg). Fraction B (227.7 mg) was purified by preparative HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (20:79.5:0.5), UV detection at 237 nm; flow rate 12 mL min-1] and afforded **7** (14.0 mg) and **8** (90.0 mg).\n\n**3,4-Dehydro-strictosidine (1):** amorphous yellow powder; UV _ma_ (MeOH) 358 (3.9), 239 (3.0 nm); IR (KBr) 3496 (OH), 3370 (NH), 1710 (C=O) cm-1; \\(\\mathrm{{}^{1}H}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{{}^{13}C}\\) NMR (see Tables 1 and 2); HRESIMs _mz_ 529.2166 [M + H]-(\\(\\mathrm{{}^{1}C}\\) scaled for C2:H2O2O2 + H, 529.2186).\n\n**3,4-Dehydro-strictosidine acid (2):** amorphous yellow powder; UV _ma_ (MeOH) 356 (3.5), 240 (3.0) nm; IR (KBr) 3440 (OH), 3368 (NH) cm-1; \\(\\mathrm{{}^{1}H}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{{}^{13}C}\\) NMR (see Tables 1 and 2); HRESIMs _mz_ 515.2056 [M + H]-(\\(\\mathrm{{}^{1}C}\\) scaled for C2:H2O2O2 + H, 515.2030).\n\n**Determination of the Radical-Scavenging Activity.** 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a stable radical in methanol (200 \\(\\mu\\)mol, 2 mL). The reagent was added to 1 mL aliquots of compounds **1**-**9**, previously dissolved in methanol, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 \\(\\mu\\)M. Each mixture was shaken and held for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin was used as a standard compound. DPPH solution (2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as control. The evaluation of the reduced form of DPPH generated in situ was performed measuring the decrease in the current (_I_) on the electrochemical cell of the EICD.\\({}^{10}\\) The areas obtained in each chromatogram were normalized and compared with the one obtained for the blank. The radical-scavenging activity of the samples was expressed in terms of C50 (concentration in \\(\\mu\\)M required for a 50% decrease in current (_I_) by the reduced form of DPPH).\n\n**Redox Potential.** The determination of the optimal potential (_E_xx) required to apply on each compound was obtained by means of hydrodynamic voltammograms generated for each compound\\({}^{10}\\) (Table 3).\n\n**TLC Screening Assay for Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors.** Samples were dissolved in MeOH or in MeOH-CH2Cl2 mixtures to 0.1 and 1.0 mM concentrations. Physostigmine and galathamine were used as reference compounds in two concentrations (0.1 and 0.01 \\(\\mu\\)M). After application of 2 \\(\\mu\\)L of each sample on a silica gel plate, it was sprayed with DTHSATC1 reagent (1:1 solution of 1 mM 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 1 \\(\\mu\\)M acetylthicololine iodide in buffer) until saturation of the silica. The plate was allowed to dry for 5 min, and then 3 U/mL of enzyme solution was sprayed. After a while, a yellow background appeared, with white spots showing the inhibitory compounds.\\({}^{4}\\)\n\n**Evaluation in a Rat Brain Assay.** The protocol adopted for this in vitro assay is described by Ellman and co-workers.\\({}^{14}\\)\n\n**Acknowledgment.** This work was funded by grants of the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) within the Biota-FAPESP-The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br), grant no. 98/05074-0 awarded to V.S.B., Principal Investigator.

Their structures were determined by spectroscopic/spectrometric data interpretation of 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR and MS experiments. The relative configuration was established by NOESY analysis, while the conformation adopted by these molecules was evaluated through molecular modeling studies and coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. Furthermore, the anxiolytic effects of the _E. mulungu_ aqueous alcoholic crude extract and of the purified alkaloids were evaluated using the elevated T-maze test.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Drosophila melanogaster (1-1)-11a-hydroxyerythrin\n\n## Page 2\n\ndemonstrate all coupling constants of H-11 with H\\({}_{\\rm{\\alpha}}\\),H\\({}_{\\rm{\\alpha}}\\)-10 (Table 1), which is completely compatible with an \\(\\alpha\\)-OH position at C-11. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR (Table 1) data also were comparable with those of the alkaloid **3**, which possesses C-11 with the same configuration. When we analyzed the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectra of **1** and **3**, the signal due to C-11 in both was observed at higher fields, \\(\\Delta\\delta\\approx 10\\) ppm, when comparable to the same carbon of (+)-11\\(\\beta\\)-hydroxyeystorine (also named (+)-erythrarine), which is a C-11 epimer.[3, 14] The total assignment of **1** was done by examination of the COSY, HMQC, NOESY, and HMBC (Figure 1) data of this compound. To confirm the relative configuration of C-3 and C-11 and to establish the conformation of **1**, the structure of (+)-\\(\\alpha\\)-hydroxyeystorine (**3**) was used as a model for a conformational analyses approach with the introduction of dihedral angle constraints obtained from the coupling constants between H11\\(-\\)H10 and H3\\(-\\)H4. On the basis of \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR data, the structure of compound **3** was build with an \\(\\alpha\\)-OH at C-11 (similar to compound **1**) and submitted to conformational analysis using the semiempirical methods AM1 and PM5 in the gas phase, with CHCl\\({}_{3}\\) and pyridine solvents, as previously described.[15, 16] The semiempirical methods were applied to compound 3 since it was previously identified as the 11a-epimer,[14] and our studies demonstrated that **3** has an 11a-hydroxyl, similar to that of the new derivative **1**. Four conformers were evaluated for this compound, obtained through inversion of ring B (two half-chairs) and of ring C (two envelopes). One of the half-chairs of ring B was not stable and changed to a twist-boat-like conformation (Figure 2C). This twist-boat, together with the conformational restraining induced by ring D, avoided the inversion of the envelope in ring C, allowing us to obtain only three minimum energy conformations for compound **3**, named **3a**, **3b**, and **3c** (Figure 2). The Haasnot\\(-\\)Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation[18] estimates the \\(\\mathcal{Y}_{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{\\rm{ \\rm{ \\rm{ \\rm{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\\)\\) the \\({}^{13}\\)H coupling constants from the electronegativity of the substituents and from the H\\(-\\)C\\(-\\)C\\(-\\)H dihedral angle geometry. The obtained theoretical coupling constants for conformations **3a**, **3b**, and **3c** are presented in Table 1, and their energies are shown in Table 2. The comparison between theoretical and experimental coupling constants allowed characterization of the conformation of the erythrina alkaloids as represented by conformation **3c** in Table 1 and Figure 2. As already described by us,[16] this Hamiltonian presents better agreement with experimental data when compared to AM1.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n(\\(F\\)(12,132) = 2.42; \\(P<0.01\\)). Individual comparisons revealed that latencies to leave the enclosed arm were decreased with both **1** (10 mg/kg) and DZP treatments. Different from CE, one-way ANOVA did not reveal any effect of **1** or DZP on the latency to leave the open arms (\\(F\\)(3,33) = 0.71; \\(P\\) = 0.54).\n\nThe effects of **2** in the ETM measurements are shown in Figure 3 C. Two-way ANOVA showed significant effect of treatment (\\(F\\)(3,55) = 13.40, \\(P<0.0001\\)), trials (\\(F\\)(4,220) = 44.23; \\(P<0.0001\\)), and treatment versus trials interaction (\\(F\\)(12,220) = 6.33; \\(P<0.0001\\)) in the inhibitory avoidance measurements. Duncan's post hoc test revealed that animals treated with **2** (3 and 10 mg/kg) or DZP exhibited lower latencies to leave the enclosed arm of the ETM when compared with the control group (\\(P<0.05\\)). Neither **2** nor DZP significantly changed escape latencies (one-way ANOVA: \\(F\\)(3,55) = 0.61, \\(P<0.60\\)).\n\nFigure 3D shows the effects of **3** on the inhibitory avoidance and escape latencies in the ETM test. Two-way ANOVA showed effects of treatment (\\(F\\)(3,31) = 7.65; \\(P<0.0001\\)), trials (\\(F\\)(4,124) = 18.38; \\(P<0.0001\\)), and treatment versus trials interaction (\\(F\\)(12,-124) = 2.14; \\(P<0.001\\)) on inhibitory avoidance acquisition. Duncan's post hoc test revealed that the doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg of **3** significantly impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, an effect also shown with DZP (\\(P<0.05\\)). One-way ANOVA showed that neither **3** nor DZP produced significant effects on latency to leave the open arm (\\(F\\)(3,31) = 0.24; \\(P=0.86\\)).\n\nAdditionally, one-way ANOVA revealed no treatment effects of CE, **1**, **2**, **3**, or DZP on the number of rearing and crossings (locomotor activity) in the arena test (see Table 3).\n\nThe present study demonstrated that acute po treatment with CE attenuated anxiety-related responses in mice submitted to an animal model of anxiety, i.e., the ETM. These results corroborate a previous study,[12] in which the aqueous alcoholic extract of _E. mulungu_, at a dose of 200 mg/kg, produced anxiolytic-like effects in the inhibitory avoidance in the ETM in rats. These authors also reported an antianxiety effect with a lower dose of CE (100 mg/kg) in the light-dark transition model. In that study CE increased both the number of transitions between light and dark compartments and the time spent in the illuminated area, measures considered as anxiety indices.[12] Similar effects have been reported with chronic treatment with an equivalent range of doses (50\\(-\\)200 mg/kg) of CE on inhibitory avoidance in the ETM as well as on the number of transitions between compartments, and in the time spent in the illuminated compartment in the light-dark transition model.[13]\n\nThis study demonstrated that the erythrinian alkaloids isolated from _E. mulungu_ provoked anxiolytic-like effects in the ETM. The new erythrinian alkaloid **1** and the two known alkaloids **2** and **3** impaired the inhibitory avoidance task, and these effects were similar to that produced by DZP, a classical anxiolytic drug.\n\nThe underlying mechanisms involved in the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids were not in the scope of the present study and remain to be determined. However, it has been demonstrated that the dihydro-\\(\\beta\\)-erythroidine, an erythromycin alkaloid, antagonizes the excitatory effects of serotonin (5-HT) at the 5-HT3 receptor.[24] Thus, it is likely that the anxiolytic effects of the erythrinian alkaloids from _E. mulungu_ involve antagonism at 5-HT3 receptors, as shown for dihydro-\\(\\beta\\)-erythroidine.[24] Although attractive, this hypothesis remains to be empirically tested. It was demonstrated that the crude extract of _E. vespertilio_ inhibited platelet 5-HT release.[23] Platelets have been used as a useful model for studying Ca2+-dependent 5-HT release,[23] the main action of serotonin at 5-HT3 receptors.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the highest dose (400 mg/kg) of the crude extract decreased escape latency (i.e., the latency to leave the open arm) in the ETM. Similar effects obtained with other classes of drugs have been previously interpreted as anxiolytic, instead of anxiogenic.[19] It has been suggested that drugs that diminish risk-assessment behavior, such as buspirone and the serotonin releaser fenfluramine, also decrease escape latencies in the ETM.[19] Curiously, the pure alkaloids did not alter escape latencies. It is likely that synergistic interactions with other compounds of the crude extract are important to provoke the anxiolytic effects observed in the escape task.\n\nTaken together, these results suggests that the new erythrinian alkaloid (+)-11a-hydroxy-erythravine (**1**) and the known (+)-erythravine (**2**) and (+)-a-hydroxyerysorting (**3**) are, in part, responsible for the anxiolytic effects observed with the crude extract of _E. mulungu_.\n\n## Experimental Section\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nOptical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz cuvette (length 1 cm).

Molecular modeling calculations were performed using the BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2 (BioMedCAChe, 2001).\n\n**Plant Material.** Influences of _E. mulungu_ were collected in September 2002, at Rifania, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen is deposited in the herbarium of the Departament of Vegetal Biotechnology, at the University of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, under the reference number HPM-0032.\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** Fresh inflorescences (3 kg) were macerated with EtOH/H3/O (70:30) at 30\\(-\\)50 U cover a period of 10 days. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a humid crude extract (CE) (120 g) that was oxidized with a 10% HOAc solution. This solution was extracted with CHCl3 and was then made alkaline (pH 9\\(-\\)10) with NHOH and re-extracted with CHCl3 to afford a mixture of crude alkaloids (670 mg).\n\nThe alkaloidal fraction was separated by flash chromatography on Si gel, exiting with CHCl3/CHOH (100:0 \\(\\rightarrow\\) 70:30), to yield 60 fractions of 20 mL each, grouped into five (1\\(-\\)2 mA; 3\\(-\\)5 m = 8; 6\\(-\\)20 m = C; 21\\(-\\)30 = D; 31\\(-\\)60 = E).

Each of the obtained conformations was further submitted to full geometry optimization using AM1 and PMS semiempirical methods in both gas and solvent phases. For representation of CDCl3 and pyridine solvents the COSMO solvation model was used. The relative permittivity value for CDCl3 was adjusted to \\(\\epsilon\\) = 4.9 and for pyridine to \\(\\epsilon\\) = 12.5, while the effective VVD radius of the solvent molecules was adjusted to 2.81 A for CDCl3 and to 2.9 A for pyridine. Hessian matrix analyses were employed to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. All calculations were performed using BioMedCAChe program version 6.1.2\\({}^{25}\\) in order to obtain theoretical \\({}^{1}\\)J\\({}_{\\rm H,H}\\) coupling constants for the minimum energy conformations produced in conformational analysis, we applied the Haasnot\\(-\\)Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation\\({}^{18}\\) to the endocytic angle geometries.\n\n**Behavioral Studies. Animals.** Male Swiss mice (Sao Paulo State University/UNESP, SP, Brazil), weighing 25\\(-\\)35 g, were housed in groups of 10 per cage (41 cm x 34 cm x 16 cm) and maintained under a normal 12 h light cycle (lights on 070-00 h) in a temperature/humidity controlled environment (23 +- 1 V/55 +- 5%). Food and water were freely available. All mice were experimentally naive. Experimental procedures were in compliance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Local Ethical Committee (no. 35/2004).\n\n**Compound Administration.** CE and alkaloids were suspended in saline (NaCl 0.9%) and diazepam (DZP) in saline at \\(\\sim\\) 2% Tween 80. Animals were orally treated with CE (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) and with a range of doses (3\\(-\\)10 mg/kg) of each isolated alkaloid, or vehicle (saline), and intraperitoneally with DZP (2 mg/kg). All compounds were administered 30 min before the experimental session.\n\n**Apparatus. Elevated T-Maze (ETM).** The ETM was positioned 38.5 cm above the floor with three arms of equal dimensions (30 cm \\(\\times\\) 5 cm). One arm was enclosed by transparent glass walls (15 cm) and stored perpendicular to two open arms. To avoid falls, the open arms were surrounded by a Plexiglas rim 0.25 cm high.\n\n**Locomotor Activity Test (LAT).** To assess locomotor activity, animals were exposed to a plastic rectangular box (40 cm x 48 cm x 30 cm) with its floor divided into 30 squares (8 cm\\({}^{4}\\)).\n\nA standard procedure was used for both tests.\\({}^{19}\\)\n\n**Statistics.** All results were initially submitted to Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Where this test yielded significance, results were log transformed and again submitted to Levene's test, before being submitted to ANOVA. The inhibitory avoidance measures obtained in the ETM were submitted to two-way ANOVA with treatment as the independent factor and trial as the dependent factor. Where significant main effects or interactions were obtained, data were further analyzed by Duncan's post hoc test. The escape latency in the ETM and LAT results were submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed by Duncan's post hoc test when significant. In all cases a \\(P\\) value \\(<\\) 0.05 was considered significant.\n\n**Acknowledgment.** This work was funded by grants of the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) as part of the Biota-FAPESP\\(-\\)The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.wi.biotas.org/.br), grant no. 03/2176-7 awarded to V.S.B.

Vieira-Junior, Luiz A. Dutra, Paulo M. P. Ferreira, Manoel O. de Moraes, Leticia V. Costa Lotufo, Claudia do O Pessoa, Roseli Buzanelli Torres, Nivaldo Boralle, Vanderlan da S. Bolzani, Alberto J. Cavalheiro\n\n###### Abstract\n\nFour new clerodane diterpenes, caseaurepestrins A-D (1**-**4**), were isolated from the leaves of _Casearia rupestris_. Compounds **1** and **4** were acetylated to yield 2,7-di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin A (**5**) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin D (**6**). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Caseaurepestrin A (**1**) exhibited the most potent activity against MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) cells, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe tropical genus _Casearia_ (_Salicaceae sensu lato_) contains ca. 180 species,1 and it is a rich source of clerodane-type diterpenes,2-13 The genus occurs widely in Brazil, where C. _sylvestris_ is the most frequent species, occurring from the Amazon basin throughout the Cerrado (savanna) to the Atlantic Forest and Southern Brazil. The clerodanes are a group of diterpenoids with interesting biological effects such as antifungal,14 antichismamial and antiplasmodal,15 antimalarial and antimyobacterium1,16 antitumor,17,18 cytotoxic,14,19,16-31 immunomodulatory,32 immunodulatory,32 and trypanodal activities.33 In our continuing investigation of the bioactive clerodane diterpenes from _Casearia_ species, we undertook the first phytochemical investigation of _Casearia rupestris_ Eichler. This shrub or small tree grows up to 6.0 m in height and is found in Brazil (Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais States) and Bolivia (Sta. Cruz State) in the Cerrado, grasslands, and sometimes pastures, at altitudes of 350-500 m.34 Investigation of the cytotoxic Et2O fraction yielded four new clerodane diterpenes (1**-**4**) (Figure 1). Compounds **1** and **4** were acetylated, resulting in two new derivatives (**5**, **6**) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic activity of the diterpenes (1**-**6**) against a panel of human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MDA/MB-435, HCT-8, and SF-295) has been evaluated.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nInvestigation of the Et2O phase of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. _nupestris_ led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, caseaurepestrins A-D (1**-**4**). 2,7-Di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin A (**5**) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcaseaurepestrin D (**6**) were obtained by acetylation of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. The structures (Figure 1) of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric data (IR, UV, NMR, and MS) and by comparison with NMR data of reported compounds.6\n\nCaseaurepestrin A (**1**) was obtained as a white, amorphous solid ([a]24D +4.3 (c 1.0, MeOH)). The molecular formula\n\n## Page 2\n\nC34H48O9 was determined by HRESIMS, based on the sodiated ion peak at _m_/_z_ 623.3190 \\([\\)M + Na\\(]^{+}\\) (calcd 623.3190), which implies 11 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the presence of carbonyl esters (1746 and 1712 cm-1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions at _l_max 223 nm (log \\(e\\) 1.40) and 268 nm (log \\(e\\) 1.50), corresponding to diene and dienome chromophores, respectively. The 13C and DEPT 135deg NMR data showed the presence of 34 carbons divided into seven quaternary (including three carbonyl carbons), 13 methine, nine methylene, and five methyl carbons. The olefinic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of **1** (Table 1) revealed proton signals with characteristic _cis_/_trans_ coupling at \\(d\\)0 5.06 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 10.5 Hz, H-15), 5.30 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 17.5 Hz, H-15), and 6.47 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 10.5, 17.5 Hz, H-14), indicating a terminal monosubstituted olefinic moiety. Another terminal methylene, identified by two singlets at _d_H 4.94 and 5.03 (2H, H-16), was connected to a quaternary carbon (C-13). An additional olefinic doublet was observed at _d_H 6.04 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 4.0 Hz, H-3) and correlated to a methine carbon at _d_C 128.6 (C-3) in the gHMQC spectrum. Two deshielded acid protons were observed at _d_H 6.35 (1H, t, \\(J\\) = 1.5 Hz, H-18) and 6.49 (1H, s, H-19), which correlated to methine signals at _d_C 96.3 and 99.8, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed the presence of two methyl groups at _d_H 1.06 (1H, brd, \\(J\\) = 4.0 Hz, H-17) and 1.07 (1H, s, H-20) and three oxymethines at _d_H 4.45 (1H, brd, \\(J\\) = 4.0 Hz, H-2), 5.18 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz, H-6), and 3.66 (1H, t, \\(J\\) = 10.0 Hz, H-7). The spectroscopic data of 1 (Tables 1 and 2) are in accord with the basic skeleton of clerodane diteroprenoids previously isolated from _Cascaria_ species.10,18,35 The acyclic moiety at C-9, including the diene group, was deduced from the correlations of H-12 with C-11, H-14 with C-13 and C-16, H-15 with C-13 and C-14, and H-16 with C-14 (Figure 2). The position of the hydroxy group at C-7 was deduced by the long-range correlation of the oxymethine signal at _d_H 3.66 (H-7) with _d_C 77.5 (C-6), 44.8 (C-8), and 11.7 (C-17) (Figure 2). A decadienoate moiety, identified by gHMBC and gCOSY correlations (Figure 2), was characterized by a \\(Z\\) - (_d_H 5.68, \\(J\\) = 11.5 Hz; 6.69, \\(J\\) = 11.5 Hz) and an _E_-double bond (_d_H 7.37, \\(J\\) = 14.0, 11.5 Hz; 6.16, \\(J\\) = 14.0, 7.0 Hz) and a triplet methyl (_d_H 0.98, \\(J\\) = 7.0 Hz). This same \n\n## Page 3\n\n19-epoxy-7-(['2/_Z_,_A_'_E_)-decadienoyloy]-2,6-dihydroxy-18-methoxy-yclero-3,13(16),14-triene.\n\nCompound **4** had the molecular formula C36H50O10, determined by HRESIMS (observed _m_/_z_ 665.3297 [M + Na]+). The 1H and 13C NMR data of **4** (caseuarpestrin D) (Tables 1 and 2) were similar to those of **2** except for replacement of a hydroxy group at C-6 by an acetyone group [d1.195 (3H, s), d1C 171.5, d20.9]. The 1H and 13C NMR assignments of compound **4** were confirmed by 2D NMR correlations, and its configuration was established by the sign of the specific rotation, NOESY interactions, and coupling constants (Figure 3). Thus, caseuarpestrin D (**4**) was assigned as _rel_-(2R,S,S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-6,18, 19-triacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7.[('2/_Z_,_A_'E_)-decadienoyloy]-2-hydro-yclero-3,13(16),14-triene.\n\nAcetylation of **1** and **4** with d2O-pyridine yielded two new clerodane direprenes derivatives, **5** and **6**, respectively (Tables 1 and 2, NMR data). The products were named 2,7-di-O-acetylcaseuarpestrin A (**5**) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcaseuarpestrin D (**6**).\n\nThe results of the biological tests of compounds **1**-**6** are shown in Table 3. Caseuarpestrins A (**1**), B (**2**), and D (**4**) showed significant cytotoxicity against four cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC50 values ranging from 0.10 to 1.3 _m_M. Compound **1** had an IC50 value of 0.36 _m_M against MDA/MB-435 and SF-295 cancer cell lines, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (Table 3). Acetylation of compounds **1** and **4** resulted in decreased cytotoxicity (Table 3), indicating that the C-2 OH group is essential for the cytotoxicity of these compounds.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nOptical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 LC polarimeter. UV spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 A spectrometer. The circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a JASCO PU-2089 HPLC system configured with a UV-vis (MD-2010) and a circular dichroism (CD-2095) detector. IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet Impact 400 spectrometer, using KBr disks. The 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT, and NOE)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}   position & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** & **6** \\\\\n1 & 2.00 m & 1.34 m & 1.96 m & 2.10 m & 2.19 m & 2.08 m \\\\  & 2.06 m & 1.91 m & & & & 2.17 m \\\\\n2 & 4.45 brt (4.0) & 4.39 brt (4.0) & 4.37 brt (4.0) & 4.35 brt (4.0) & 5.55 m & 5.52 m \\\\\n3\n\n## Page 4\n\nand 2D (\\({}^{1}\\)H-1\\({}^{1}\\)HgCOSY, \\({}^{1}\\)H-1\\({}^{3}\\)C gHMQC, gHMBC, and gNOSSY) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (\\({}^{1}\\)H) and 125 MHz (\\({}^{13}\\)C) with pulse field gradient and a Varian INOVA 300 spectrometer (7.4 T) at 300 MHz (\\({}^{1}\\)H) and 75 MHz (\\({}^{13}\\)C), using methanol-\\(d_{4}\\) as the internal standard for \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR chemical shifts and residual undeuterated solvent (methanol) as the internal standard for \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR, with the \\(\\delta\\) scale reported relative to TMS. Positive-ion HRMS spectra were recorded on an UltraOTOFq (Bruker Daltonics) ESI-qTOF mass spectrometer, using TFANa as the internal standard. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 with UV-vs detector (model 330), using a Phenomence C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \\(\\mu\\)m). Open column chromatography was performed over silica gel (40-63 \\(\\mu\\)m, Merck) or silica C18 (40 \\(\\mu\\)m, J. T. Baker) or on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF354 plates. Spots on TLC plates were observed under UV light and by spraying the plates with anisaldehyde\\(-\\)H2SO4 reagent, followed by heating at 120 degC.\n\nPlant Material. _Casesaria rupstris_ leaves were collected in May 2007 in Campinas municipality, Saio Paulo State, Brazil. The plant material was identified by one of the authors (R.B.T.). A voucher specimen (IAC41542) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Agronomico de Campinas (Sao Paulo State).\n\n### Extraction, Isolation, and Chemical Transformation.\n\nThe dried and ground leaves (0.46 kg) were exhaustively extracted by successive macration with hexanes, EtOH, and H2O (3.0 L x 3) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was concentrated under reduced pressure at 40 degC to yield 30.0 g of a crude extract. This extract was then diluted with MeOH\\(-\\)H2O (3:1) and successively partitioned with hexanes (1.0 L x 3), Et2O (1.0 L x 3), and Et2OAc (1.0 L x 3). After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 10.8, 3.2, and 1.2 g, respectively. Part of the cytotoxic Et2O (3.0 g) fraction was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (78.0 x 3.0 cm) eluted with MeOH, to afford 38 fractions. These fractions were combined on the basis of their TLC profiles. Fraction 12 (1.7 g) was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel-C18, 78.0 x 3.0 cm,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n1 & 30.6, CH2 & 30.6, CH2 & 30.6, CH2 & 30.5, CH2 & 27.8, CH2 & 27.8, CH2 \\\\\n2 & 64.2, CH & 64.2, CH & 64.3, CH & 64.0, CH & 67.5, CH & 67.4, CH\n\n## Page 5\n\n40 \\(\\mu\\)m) using a step gradient from H2O\\(-\\)MeOH 23:77 to 00:100, yielding 55 fractions.

Compounds 1 and 4 (20 mg each) were dissolved in pyridine (4.0 mL) and treated with AcO(3.0 mL) at room temperature for 24 h. The solvents were removed by evaporation under reduced pressure, resulting in compounds 5 (18.0 mg) and 6 (18.0 mg).\n\n_Cosequercetin A (1_): White, amorphous solid; [o]24 +-3 (_c_ 0.1, CHCl3); UV \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}^{\\text{MOH}}\\) (nm (_log_c_) \\(2\\)23 (1.40), 268 (1.50)).

Additionally, four known polyketides, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methoxyeugenin (6), and 9-hydroxyeugenin (7), were also isolated. The structural characterization of compounds was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy, time-dependent density functional theory calculations, and X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1-9 were weakly active when tested in antileishmanial and cytotoxicity assays.\n\nE-nodophytic microorganisms live inside the tissues of host plants without apparently harming them and are a promising source of bioactive compounds.1, 2, 3, 4 Species of _Mycoleptodiscus_, such as _M. indicus_, _M. terrestris_, and _M. shericus_, are commonly isolated as endophytes; they are probably latently phytopathogenic and may become phytopathogenic when the host plant is subjected to stress.5_M. indicus_, a tropical to subtropical species, occurs in leaves of different host plants, mainly monocyclotendus. _M. indicus_ is associated with large spreading lesions on leaves of _Zamia_ spp_, an American cycad, and other monocyclotendous plants.6_M. indicus_ has occasionally been reported to infect humans and canines, causing septic arthritis and skin infections.7\n\nIn this paper, the isolation, structural characterization, and biological activity of secondary metabolites from cultures of _M. indicus_, an endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves from _Borreia verticillata_ (Rubiaceae), are reported. Three new azaphilones, named myelopentones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5), were isolated and fully characterized; in addition, four known polyketides, namely, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methoxyeugenin (6), and 9-hydroxyeugenin (7), were isolated and identified, and the acetylated derivatives of austdiol (8) and mycoleptone A (9) were synthesized (Figure 1).\n\n## 2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSeven secondary metabolites of _M. indicus_ were isolated, four of which were identified as austdiol, eugenitin, 6-methoxyeugenin, and 9-hydroxyeugenin by comparison of experimental spectroscopic data with literature values.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 6\n\n## Page 2\n\nhead-to-tail acetate units, and possesses two C1 units introduced from _S_-adenosylmethionine.17 A wide range of interesting biological activities of azabilones, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, cytotoxic, nematicidal, and anti-inflammatory, have been reported in the literature;14,17 their nonselective biological activities may be related to the production of vinylogous _g_-pyridones.18\n\nThree of the isolated metabolites are previously unreported azabilones and were named myelopentores A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5). Mycoleptone A (2) was isolated as a yellow powder, and the complete structural characterization was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies (Figure 2). The UV spectrum of 2 displays maximum absorptions at 254 nm (log \\(e\\) 2.90) and 361 nm (log \\(e\\) 2.83), revealing the presence of an extended conjugated system, characteristic of azabilones. Compound 2 displays similar 1H and 13C NMR spectra to austdiol,8,9 with the replacement of the aldehyde signals (_d_H 9.99 and _d_C 189.3) by methylene signals (_d_H 3.26 and _d_C 18.5) at position C-5. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibits two signals at _d_H 7.30 and 6.25 due to hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring, two hydroxyl hydrogens at _d_H 5.66 (OH, d, \\(J\\) = 4.6 Hz) and 4.93 (OH, s), a methine signal at _d_H 4.22 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 4.6 Hz), a methylene signal at _d_H 3.26, and two methyl signals at _d_H 2.07 and 0.91. The 13C NMR spectrum displays signals for 12 carbons atoms, 11 of which refer to two atoms each: two signals due to methyl carbon atoms (_d_C 19.2 and 18.8), five signals from the skeleton of the polybenzrong ring (_d_C 157.8; 143.5; 141.0; 120.7 and 104.6), and four signals from the skeleton of the cyclohexenone, with one signal due to ketone carbonyl groups (_d_C 197.8; IR _m_max 1667 cm-1), one due to quaternary unsaturated carbon atoms (_d_C 112.7), and two due to oxygenated carbon atoms (_d_C 75.6 and 71.0). The remaining signal refers to a methylene group (_d_C 18.5). The heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMRBC) spectrum shows key correlations of CH2-10 to C-4a, C-5, C-6, C-4a', C-5', and C-6', revealing the attachment of two azaphilone units through a methylene bridge at position C-5 (Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of four hydroxyl groups was confirmed by acetylation with pyridine-Ac2O to afford the tetracapted derivative (9). NMR spectroscopy identifies the structure of 2 as being formed by two astditol units linked by a methylene group, generating a compound with the molecular formula C23H24O8 as determined by HRMS ([M + H]+ at _m_/_z_ 429.1543). The chemical structure explains the simplicity of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, in which the signal intensities are doubled, except for the methylene group.\n\nCompound 2 is a chiral molecule having four asymmetric carbons and a formal binary symmetry axis. An accurate analysis of the eight enantiomeric pairs of 2 reveals that two pairs are formed by nonoptically active _meso_ structures and two more pairs are repeated twice; as a result, four pairs of enantiomers and two _meso_ structures are possible. Since the reliable assessment of the absolute configuration of a compound is achieved when the theoretical chiroptical properties19 of all the possible optically active diastereomers are determined,20 quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations were performed on four diastereomers of 2 (Figure 3): (7\\(R\\),85,7'_R_,8'_'_S_)**-2 (2A), (7\\(R\\),8_,8'_T_,8_'_R_'_R_)**-2 (2B), (7\\(R\\),8_,8_'_T_,8_'_S_,8'_S_'_S_)**-2 (2C), and (7\\(S\\),8\\(S\\),7_'S_,8_'S_'_S_)**-2 (2D). QM calculations were carried out\n\nFigure 1.: Mycoleptones A–C and polyketides from _Mycoleptodiscus indicus._\n\nFigure 2.: ORTEP representation of mycoleptone A (atom displacement at 30% probability).

DFT geometry optimization (Table 2) yielded two equilibrium conformers having D_E_QAM <= 2 kcal mol-1 for diastereomers **2A**, **2B**, and **2C**, while a single equilibrium conformer within the same threshold energy was found for diastereomers **2D**. The most populated conformers of **2A** (Figure 4) display similar geometric features: the azaphilone units are oriented in an \"open folder\" conformation, the pyran oxygen atoms are pointing toward opposite directions, and all the hydroxy groups are equatorial and form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with each other and with the ketone carbonyl groups. The main difference lies in the direction of the axial methyl groups on C-7 and C-7, which point outside the molecular cavity for **2A**-**e** and inside for **2A**-**b**.\n\nThe experimental ECD spectrum of **2** in methanol (Figure 5) shows four bands. The broad positive band centered at 372 nm has a strong contribution from the n - _p_a* transitions of the ketone carbonyls, which are affected by the chiral environment around these groups. The positive band at 311 nm with a shoulder around 285 nm, the sharp negative peak at 252 nm, and the positive peak at 228 nm are due to \\(p\\) - _p_a* transitions of the conjugated system, which are affected by the chirality of the rings and by the mutual orientation of the azaphilone units. The theoretical ECD spectra of the diastereomers of **2** (Figure 6) displayed different patterns, reflecting their different stereochemistry. The comparison between the calculated spectrum of **2A** and the experimental spectrum of **2** (Figure 7) shows that TD-DFT calculations are able to reproduce the experimental pattern of the transitions in the high-energy region, considering that transition energies are usually underestimated by PBE0.21 The transitions in the low-energy region are not reproduced, suggesting that QM calculations are unable to describe the chiral environment of the ketone moieties, in particular hydrogen-bonding interactions with hydroxy groups and solvent molecules, with adequate accuracy. On the other hand, the theoretical ECD spectra of the remaining diastereomers (reported in the Supporting Information) are unable to reproduce the experimental ECD pattern in the high-energy region: on this basis, a (7R,8S,7'R,8'S) absolute configuration can be predicted for **2**.\n\nCompound **2** crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2); the X-ray geometric parameters selected for comparison with the precursor austdiol are listed in Table 3. The C-5--C-10 distance was elongated upon change of hybridization to sp3 for atom C-10, and the C-5--C-4a distance was shortened, increasing the double-bond character. The pyran rings are almost planar with an rmsd from the mean plane of 0.03 A, while the cyclohexenone rings adopt a twisted envelope conformation with atoms C-7 and C-7 as flap atoms. The X-ray structure of **2** shows that the azaphilone units have the same absolute configuration as austdiol,22 retaining the stereochemistry of the chiral centers as (7R,8S); moreover,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c}  & & myolpetone A (2)a & & myolpetone B (4)a & & myolpetone C (5)a & \\\\ position & _δ_c mult. & _δ_a (J min Hz) & HMBCa & _δ_c mult. & _δ_a (J m Hz) & HMBCa & _δ_c mult. & _δ_a (J m Hz) & HMBCa \\\\\n1 & 143.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nDFT conformer **2A**-**b** shows a close resemblance to the crystallographic structure of **2.** On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the structure of mycoelptone A (**2**) was therefore elucidated as (7\\(R\\),8,5,7',R_,8')-5-[(7',8'-dihydroxy-3',7'-dimethyl-6'-oxo-7',8'-dihydroxy-6'-H'-isochromen-5'-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihy-droxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6'H-isochromen-6-one.\n\nThe molecular formula of mycoelptone B (**4**) was determined as C23H2O8 by a combination of HRMS, 1H and 13C NMR, homonuclear correlation (COSY), heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC), and HMBC spectroscopies. The 1H NMR spectrum contains five doublets, four singlets, two double doublets, and one multiplet; some similarities with the 1H NMR spectrum of **2** are observed, with the presence of two hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring at _d_H 7.43 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.8 Hz) and 6.63 (1H, s), an oxygenated sp3 methine group at _d_H 4.42 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 1.8 Hz), a CH2 group at _d_H 3.60 (1H, d, _f_gm = 15.0 Hz) and 3.53 (1H, d, _f_gm = 15.0 Hz) due to the methylene bridge at position C-10 connecting the azapholine unit to a dihydroisocoumarin moiety, and two methyl signals at _d_H 2.22 and 1.10. For the dihydroisocoumarin moiety, the 1H NMR spectrum displays an oxygen-bearing methine hydrogen at _d_H 4.55 (1H, m), a methylene group at _d_H 3.17 (1H, dd, \\(J\\) = 16.0, 3.0 Hz) and 2.60 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 16.0, 11.0 Hz), and two methyl groups at _d_H 2.06 (3H, s) and 1.44 (3H, d, \\(J\\) = 6.2 Hz). The 13C NMR spectrum of **4** displays signals for 23 carbon atoms: one signal due to the methylene bridge (_d_C 20.7), 11 signals belonging to the azaphilone moiety as in **2**,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c}  & conformer & \\(\\bar{\\alpha}_{1}\\) (deg)a  & \\(\\bar{\\alpha}_{2}\\) (deg)b  & \\(\\bar{\\beta}\\) (deg)c  & d (Å)a  & \\(\\bar{\\Delta}\\)f (Å)a [FOOTNOTE:a]Footnote a: C-10–C.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nand 11 signals belonging to the dihydroxyicocumarin moiety. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data reveal six resonances for sp\\({}^{2}\\) carbon atoms being part of a benzene ring, two of them characterized by a downfield shift due to the hydroxy substituents (C-6' at \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 160.2; C-8' at \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 160.9) and the presence of a carbonyl group at \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 171.2 (C-1'; IR \\(\\nu_{\\rm max}\\) 1652 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)). The structural features of the lactone ring were determined from the \\({}^{1}\\)H-1H COSY spectrum based on the couplings between H2-4' and H-3', as well as between H-3' and H2-9'. The HMBC correlations of CH2-4' to \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 136.8 (C-5'), \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 100.1 (C-8'), \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 75.0 (C-3'), and \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 19.6 (C-9') proved the connection of the two units. In addition, the HMBC spectrum displays relevant correlations from CH2-10 (\\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) 3.60, 3.53) to \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 199.3 (C-6), 143.7 (C-4a), and 112.8 (C-5) from the azaphilome moiety and to \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 160.9 (C-8'), 160.2 (C-6'), and 116.5 (C-7') from the dihydroxyicouarn moiety, characterizing the connection between the two units by a methylene bridge to afford the compound (7R,8S)-5-[(6',8'-dihydroxy-3',5'-dimethyl-1'-oxoisochroman-7'-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-isoc-chromen-6-one.\n\nThe molecular formula of mycobacteria C (5) was deduced as C23H2O8 by HRMS analysis in combination with \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectroscopies. The \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum displays nine singlets and two doublets; as in compounds **2** and **4**, the methylene group at \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) 3.74 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 15.0 Hz) and 3.46 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 15.0 Hz) connects two moieties, the azaphilome and chromone units. The azaphilome moiety shows five uncoupled hydrogen atoms at \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) 7.52 (H-1), 7.03 (H-4), 4.25 (H-8), 2.25 (H-9), and 1.00 (H-10); the chrome moiety displays four uncoupled hydrogen atoms at \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) 13.06 (H-5'), 6.13 (H-3'), 2.37 (H-9'), and 2.00 (H-10'), the sharp singlet at \\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) 13.06 being interpreted as a hydrogen-bonded phenol hydroxy group. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum confirms 23 carbon signals, namely, four methyl, one methylene, four methylene, and 14 quaternary carbon signals. The chrome moiety displays one ketone carbonyl group (\\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 181.8; IR \\(\\nu_{\\rm max}\\) 1690 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and four quaternary aromatic (\\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 153.5, 107.8, 105.0, and 103.1), two oxygenated aromatic (\\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 161.1 and 156.6), two unsaturated (\\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 167.2 and 107.9), and two methyl (\\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 20.2 and 8.5) carbon atoms. The structure of the chrome portion was determined on consideration of the molecular formula, double-bond equivalents, and the downfield shifts of the carbon signals at C-2' and C-8a' (\\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 167.2 and 153.5). The HMBC spectrum of **5** revealed relevant correlations of CH2-10 (\\(\\delta_{\\rm H}\\) 3.74, 3.46) to \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 200.5 (C-6), 144.3 (C-4a), and 112.1 (C-5) from the azaphilome moiety and to \\(\\delta_{\\rm C}\\) 161.1 (C-7'), 156.6 (C-5'), and 107.8 (C-6') from the chrome moiety, revealing the\n\nFigure 5: Experimental UV and ECD spectra of mycoleptone A (19 \\(\\mu\\)M in MeOH, 1 cm path length).\n\nFigure 6: Theoretical ECD spectra of the diastereomers of mycoheptone at the PBE0/6-311++G(2d,2p)/IEPEPM(MeOH)//B97D/6-311++G(2d,2p)/IEPEPM(MeOH) level (\\(\\chi_{\\rm QM}\\)-based conformational averaging, \\(\\Delta\\sigma\\) = 0.3 eV).

The methylene bridge in aspergilone B,24 an azaphilone dimer that was isolated from a marine-derived fungus of the _Aspergillus_ species, was hypothesized to derive from a formaldehyde biosynthetic pathway; the same hypothesis was proposed for the biosynthesis of xyloketal F2,25 a dimer isolated from a mangrove fungus of the _Xylaria_ species.\n\nThe condensation of two austdiol units to form mycyclotpone A (**2**) is consistent with a possible biosynthetic pathway similar to the one proposed for dicitrinone C23 (Figure 8). One austdiol unit may undergo decarbonylation, while the aldehyde group of the second austdiol unit may be reduced to a reactive carbocation species: the two units may then react by Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Similar pathways may also explain the condensation of the dihydroisocumarin and chromone units with an austdiol unit in mycyclotpones B (**4**) and C (**5**), respectively. Due to the limited number of methylene-bridged azaphilones discovered to date, however, a general biosynthetic pathway cannot be postulated, and the biologically mediated mechanisms of such reactions are unknown.\n\nThe results of antileishmanial and cytotoxicity tests on the isolated compounds are shown in Table 4. Compounds **1-9** exhibit no significant activity against _Leishmania donovani_ and _Leishmania major_ compared to the standard antileishmanial drugs Geneticin (_L. major_), amphotericin B, and pentamidin (_L. donovani_). Mycolpetone B (**4**) was the most cytotoxic metabolite (PC3 cells: IC50 = 7.1 +- 3.8 _m_M), but its activity was lower than that of doxorubicin, the reference compound for cytotoxicity assays.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures\n\nOptical rotations were measured in CHCl3 MeOH, or DMSO using a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter at room temperature; IR spectra were recorded with KBr discs using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer. UV spectra were measured in CHCl3 MeOH, and DMSO on a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp multisolvent delivery system, a SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector, an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection, and processing, and a Shim-pack CLC-ODS(M) reversed-phase column (250 x 4.5 mm i.d.; 5 _m_m particle size) protected by a Pelligural LC-18 cartridge. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance DXR-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 15C NMR in CDCl3, CO3D, or DMSO-_\n\n## Page 7\n\nwere carried out at 0.2 nm intervals using a 1 nm spectral bandwidth, a 20 nm min-1 scan rate, and a 4 s time constant.\n\n**Fungal Material.** The fungus was isolated as an endophyte from the medicinal plant _Borreira verticillatta_ (L.) G. F. W. Meyer, belonging to the Rubiaceae family, and is native to South America. Five specimens of _B. verticillatta_ with a healthy appearance were collected from the campus of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) (34deg56'57deg W; 8deg25'53deg S) in January 2006, approximately 43 cm in height and bearing flowers. Then, the samples were taken to the laboratory and processed in 24 h. A voucher specimen of the plant (No. 42.234/UFPE) was identified and deposited at the Herbarium Professor Geraldo Mariz, UFP, Department of Botany, UFPE, Recife, Brazil. The isolate was identified as _Mycolleostasis_ index based on sequence analysis of the ITS region of the cDNA (GenBank accession number GU220382.1).\n\n**Cultivation, Extraction, and isolation.**_M. indicus_ was grown on potato dextrose agar plates for 7 days at 30 degC. Then, 10 plugs were transferred to five Erinemeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing 100 mL of potato dextrose broth prepared with distilled water. Flasks were shaken on a rotary shaker at 30 degC and 120 rpm for 48 h. Next, 10 mL was transferred to each of 50 flasks containing 90 g of solid medium (rice-out). These were grown for 30 days. On day 30, the mycelial mass was macerated with ethanol overnight and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to obtain a crude ethanol extract (22 g), which was partitioned with three times equal volumes of hexane and CH2Cl2, respectively, yielding hexane (6 g) and dichloromethane fractions (6.9 g). The CH2Cl2 fraction was suspended in MeOH and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, furnishing a precipitate fraction (3870 mg) and a soluble fraction (3030 mg). The precipitate fraction was subjected to the chromatography over a silica gel column (30 x 3.5 cm i.d.) using a MeOH-CH2Cl2 gradient to yield 67 fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC profiles into seven fractions: A (19 mg), B (33 mg), C (2968 mg), D (100 mg), E (210 mg), F (285 mg), and G (109 mg). Fraction C (2968 mg) yielded anadid (2830 mg), after crystallization in MeOH, and fraction E afforded mycoletrone A (2, 200 mg) by precipitation. The soluble fraction (3030 mg) was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 x 3 cm i.d.) using MeOH as the mobile phase, furnishing 10 fractions (S1-S10). Fraction S6 (280 mg) was washed with MeOH, yielding eugenintin (50 mg). The soluble portion was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 x 2 cm i.d.) using a MeOH-CH2Cl2 gradient. Forty-two fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC profiles to yield nine fractions. The fourth fraction (S6.4, 28 mg) was purified by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane-ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to furnish myelotrone B (4, 10 mg) and myelocetrone C (5, 2 mg). Fraction S5 (461 mg) was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 x 2 cm i.d.) eluted with a gradient of MeOH in CH2Cl2. Thirty fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC profiles to yield 10 fractions. The fourth fraction (S5.4, 60 mg) was purified by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane-ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to provide 6-methoxyegenin (14 mg). The fifth fraction (S5.5, 4 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using CH2CN-H2O (10:90 to 100:0, v/v) as choline phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min over 23 min, yielding 9-hydroxyegenin (2 mg).\n\n**Acclation of Austoichi and Mycoletrone A (2).** A solution containing austral (80 mg), pyridine (2 mL), and Ac2O (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. H2O (6 mL) was added into the reaction mixture, which was subsequently extracted with CH2Cl2, the organic layer was evaporated to give a yellow, amorphous solid (140 mg), which was purified by preparative TLC eluted with a mixture of CH2Cl2-MeOH (98:2, v/v) to afford the diacetylated derivative (8, 80.7 mg). Acetylation of myeloprone A (2, 25 mg) was performed in a similar manner, yielding the tetraacetylated derivative (9, 20 mg).\n\n**Quantum-Mechanical Calculations.** Conformational analysis on the selected diastereomers of 2 was performed in two steps. In the first step, a preliminary conformer distribution was determined by molecular mechanics (MM) calculations at the MMFF94s26 level using the Spartan'02 software.27 In the second step, DFT28,29 geometry optimizations were performed on the MM conformers having relative energies (D_E_BM) within a threshold value of 3 kcal mol-7. DFT calculations were carried out at the B97D/6-311++G(2d,2p) level100-33 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 The Boltzmann distribution of conformers at 298.15 K and 1 atm was then calculated from the relative electronic energies (D_E_BM). TDDFT35 calculations were carried out at the PBE0/6-311+G(2d,2p) level131-33,36-38 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 All calculations were performed using the IEFPCM continuum solvation model39,40 for MeOH. Rational strengths (R) and excitation wavelengths (_l_) were calculated for the lowest 50 excited states on the optimized geometries having D_E_BM <= 2 kcal mol-1. Theoretical ECD spectra were then obtained by approximation of \\(R\\) values to Gaussian functions with a half-bandwidth at D_E_max/e (D_D_G) of 0.3 eV, summation over all excited states, and conformational averaging, according to the Boltzmann distribution of conformers (_I_QM).41\n\n**Crystallographic Structure.** Crystals of **2** suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by crystallisation from a methanol solution. A colorless prismatic crystal of approximate dimensions 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 mm3 was used for the experiment. X-ray data were measured on an Enar-Nonins CAD-4 diffractometer employing graphite-monochromated Cu Ka radiation (_l_ = 1.5418 A) at 298 K and operating in the _σ_=0 scan. Crystal data: C3H2O3O3 \\(M\\) = 428.42, triclinic, space group \\(P\\)1, \\(a\\) = 10.473(6) \\(A\\), \\(b\\) = 11.223(3) \\(A\\), \\(c\\) = 11.429(2) \\(A\\), \\(a\\) = 60.65(2)3, \\(b\\) = 89.83(3)3, \\(g\\) = 67.57(4)9, \\(V\\) = 1055.5(9) \\(A\\)3_2, \\(Z\\) = 2, _D_c = 1.348 g/cm3, _F_(000) = 452, and _r_(Cu Ka) = 0.86 mm-1. All tested crystal samples showed germination, and the sample used for data collection was visually homogeneous, but it showed pseudomerhedral twinning, which caused partial superposition of structure factors leading to high residuals during the structure refinements. A total of 8384 reflections were collected (4273 unique bins 96.26% of Friedel mates) in the _θ_ range 4.56deg to 73.92deg and index ranges \\(h\\) from 15 to -15, \\(k\\) from -24 to 25, and \\(l\\) from -15 to 15. Cell refinement and data reduction were performed with the XCAD4 software suite. The structure was solved and refined using the Wing2K with SHELX97 suite.42,43 Structure refinement was performed on \\(P\\)1 by full-matrix least-squares calculations. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and all hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized coordinates and refined as riding atoms with isotropic parameters relative to their parent atoms. The final refinement residuals were \\(R\\)1 = 0.091 (_w_R1 = 0.32) for 6964 observed reflections with \\(l\\) > 2_σ_(_I_), 575 variable parameters, and three restraints, being \\(R\\)1 = 0.11 (_w_R_2 = 0.32) for all unique reflections with Gof = 1.41. The absolute structure Flack parameter was 0.1(3), indicating that the chiral sense was correctly chosen, although this number was not reliable, given the large standard deviation, in the absence of strong anomalous scatterers.\n\n**Biological Assays.** The microplate Alarm-Blue assay was used to determine growth inhibition against _L. donovanii_.44 Antleishmaninal (_L. major_) and cytotoxicity assays against human colon cancer (HCT-8) cells, human leukemia cancer (HL-60) cells, human melanoma cancer (MDA-MB435) cells, human prostate cancer (PC3) cells, human glioblastoma cancer (SF-95) cells, and human lymphocyte cells were assessed employing a colorimetric method.44\n\nFootnote 44: endopeptidase (_P_1, \\(a\\), \\(b\\),\n\n## Page 8\n\n\\({}^{11}\\)C NMR reported in Table 1; HRMS _m/z_ 451.1363 [M + Na]+ (caled for C\\({}_{23}\\)H\\({}_{20}\\)O\\({}_{4}\\) + Na+, 451.1363).\n\n_Mycoloptone C (S)_: brown, amorphous solid; \\([a]^{15}\\) +95 (c 0.2, DMSO), UV (MeOH) _l_max (log \\(c\\) 2) 234 (3.17), 297 (3.15), 321 (3.17) nm; IR (KV) _l_max 2920, 2360, 1690, 1573, 1478 cm-3; \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR reported in Table 1; HRMS _m/z_ 427.1387 [M + H]+ (caled for C\\({}_{23}\\)H\\({}_{20}\\)S\\({}_{4}\\) + H'; 427.1387 [M + H]+ (caled for _d-Methovequention (6)_: white, solid powder; mp 155-158 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C; \\([a]^{15}\\)) \\(C\\) (0 _\n\n## Page 9\n\nForesman, J.

Le Roch, Mario A. Izidoro, Paulo C. Vieira\n\n# Abstract\n\n_Metrodorea stipularis_ stem extracts were studied in the search for possible antichagastic, antimalarial, and antitumoral compounds using cruzain from _Tympanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium falciparum_, and cathepsin B and L, as molecular targets, respectively. Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed significant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Compounds 1-4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 \\(\\mu\\)M against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three different strains of _P. falciparum_ in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsin B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 \\(\\mu\\)M. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe study of the role of the various species of dihydrochalcones is a key step in the development of the biological process of cancer.

Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6-trihydroyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2,en-1-yl)phenyl)propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2\n\nCompounds **2** and **3** were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESTTOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for **2** and **3**, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C23H30O3 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for **2** and **3** showed one singlet at \\(d\\) 5.92 attributed to H-8', the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both **2** and **3** the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.76 (H-3') and 2.53 (H-4') and the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.33 (H-9' and H-10'). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at \\(d\\) 6.91 (H-5' and H-7') and 6.56 (H-8') for **2** and signals at \\(d\\) 6.87 (H-2'), 6.83 (H-6'), and 6.64 (H-5') for **3** assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound **2** showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at \\(d\\) 1.73 (H-3') and 2.69 (H-4') and the signals of the methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.22 (H-8' and H-9'). Compound **3** displayed one premyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4'' and H-5''), one olefinic hydrogen at \\(d\\) 5.28 (H-2''), and the methylene signal at \\(d\\) 3.25 (H-1''). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in **1** and confirmed the structures of **2** and **3**.\n\nCompound **4** was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESTTOFMS data showed the molecular ion at _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (calculated _m_/_z_ 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O3. As mentioned for compounds **2** and **3**, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the characteristic signals of the three methyl groups at \\(d\\) 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at \\(d\\) 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and confirmed the structure of **4**.\n\nThe dihydrochalcones **1**-**4** showed inhibition activities against crazin, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 _m_M (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the first report of crazin inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies.\n\nDihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 _m_M (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochalcones **1** and **3** showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these compounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more effective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydrochalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsin s such as cathepsin K.12\n\nThe dihydrochalcones were also tested against _Plasmodium falciparum_ growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against _P. falciparum_ the dihydrochalcones **2** and **4** showed significant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 _m_M for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against _P. falciparum_ growth for this class of compounds.\n\nFour compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases crazin and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of _Plasmodium falciparum_. The results described in this paper are significant, since this is the first report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against crazin, and it is interesting that compounds **2** and **4** are active against cathepsin B, while compounds **1** and **3** are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of finding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n### General Experimental Procedures.\n\nAll commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co, and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-_4\\(6\\) and methanol-_4\\(p\\) using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe AITA). MS data were collected on a Bruker Dalonics micrOTOF-Q. II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H5SO/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230-700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna).\n\n### Plant Materials.\n\nThe stems of _Metrodarea stipularis_ were collected in July 2010 at the Agornomic Institute in Campinas, SP1; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**Extraction and Isolation.** The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 degC, affording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against crucain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed significant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 5.0 cm x h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10.0, 15.5, 5.5, 0.10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1-MSD24).\n\nFraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15.1-MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg).\n\nFraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 3.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD211_1-MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD211_8-MSD21\\(8\\)20). Subfraction MSD21_8 12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (_ph_ = 2.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21\\(8\\)19 (9 mg) was purified by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, _ph_ = 1.0 cm x \\(h\\) = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/cAMP/H2O (4:15) as mobile phase and a flow of 3.5 mL/min to afford 4 (2.5 mg).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)/propan-1-one (2):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2066 (caled for C3H2H2O3 _m_/_z_ 410.2094).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(14-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbutyric acid-2-1-methylphenylpropan-1-one (3):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 1; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 410.2040).\n\n_1-(5,7-Dhydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4-trimethyl-2,3,44,96-hydroxy-10-Mantham-7-ylpropan-1-one (4):_ amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-4_d_) see Table 2; ESTOFMS _m_/_z_ 478.2714 (caled for C9H2O3 _m_/_z_ 478.2720).\n\n**Enzyme Inhibition Assays.**_Gruzin._ All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectrofluorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured by hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonylphenylanalytarginine-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide). The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) with 5 mL of DTT at 37 degC after addition of 2 mL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with five inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the program GraFit S.\n\n_Cothepins._ All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Molecular Devices Spectra\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & compound 2 & compound 3 & \\\\ position & _δ_0°_a_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ & _δ_0°_ \\\\\n1 & 204.7, qC & & 204.0, qC & & \\\\\n2 & 45.5, CH2 & 3.30, t (7.2) & 6°, 1, 3 & 45.5, CH2 & 3.25, t & 1, 2° \\\\\n3′ & 29.7, CH2 & 2.83 & 5′, 7′, 1, 2 & 30.2, CH2 & 2.82, t (8.4) & 1′\n\n## Page 4\n\nMAX M3 fluorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic fluorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and a concentration of 185 _m_M for catB and 10 _m_M for catL. The enzyme was activated for 5 min with DTT and acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 degC, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 200 _m_L, kept under stirring (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptides, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with at least seven inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot 12.0.\n\n_Bioasory of Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth._ The strains 3D7, W2, and Dd2 of _P. falciparum_ malaria parasites (BEI Resources, MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in human type O+ erythrocytes in complete medium (RPMI 1640 (Celgrg), 0.043 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 0.014 mg/mL hypoxanthine (Acros), 38.5 mm HEPES (Sigma), 0.18% NaHCO3 (Celgrg), 0.20% Glucose (MP Biomedical), 0.003 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.2% Albumax (Gibco), 5% human serum) as previously described.1 Briefly, cultures were maintained in 25 cm2 flasks (Corning) at a volume of 10 mL and were glassed for 30 s with an environment of 3% CO2, 1% O2, and 96% N2, then incubated at 37 degC.\n\nThe antimalarial activity was determined with a SYBR Green based parasite proliferation assay, adapted from Smilkstein15 and Bennett.16 Using this technique, the increase of parasite DNA contained in human red blood cells was measured after 72 h of incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds.17 Relative fluorescence values were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM fluorimeter (excitation 495 nm and emission 525 nm).

Therefore, the structure **1** was proposed for cuspanine.\n\nCusculine [**2**] is very closely related to cuspanine [**1**]. The only difference observed in the \\({}^{1}\\)H-nmr spectrum was an additional peak for an MeO group, suggesting the presence of five MeO groups in the molecule. In addition to this observation, the bathochromic shift observed in the uv spectrum of **1** was not detected with **2**, indicating that an MeO group was substituted for the phenolic group of **1**. This was further supported by the \\({}^{13}\\)C-nmr spectrum which showed three signals in lower field at 8 61.89, 61.53, and 60.94, indicating the presence of three hindered MeO groups (4) and leading to structure **2** for cusculine.\n\nCuspanine [**2**], 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone, was synthesized from 2-bromo-3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid [**6**]. The first method that was tried for the preparation of **6** was the bromination of isovanillin in refluxing CHCl3, followed by methylation (Me2SO4) and oxidation (Jones' reagent). However, the bromination gave a poor yield (18%), so the following alternate approach, using a directed metallation method, was adopted.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nThe methoxymethyl ether (MOM ether) [4], prepared from 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol [3] and methoxymethyl chloride, was lithiated in Et2O with _n_-butyllithium at 0deg. The resulting yellow precipitates were treated with \\(1,1,2,2,\\)-tetrabromoethane (5) at \\(-78^{\\circ}\\), and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature to give a bromide **5** with a 66% yield. Hydrolysis of the MOM ether of **5** with HBr in warm EtOH, followed by oxidation with Jones' reagent, gave **6** in a 69% yield. Ullmann condensation (6) of **6** and \\(3,4,5\\)-trimethoxysaniline [7] in the presence of freshly prepared copper powder and K2CO3 in DMF gave **8** with a 56% yield appearing as orange plates. Treatment of **8** with polyphosphoric acid and xylene (7) at \\(150^{\\circ}\\) gave **2** in the form of yellow prisms with a yield of 55%. Selective hydrolysis of the 1-MeO group of **2** was achieved by refluxing in MeOH with concentrated HCl and 70% HClO4 to afford **1** (Scheme 1). The physical data for both **1** and **2** were identical with those of the natural products. The structure of **1** was unambiguously determined by a single crystal **X**-ray analysis (Figure 1).\n\nBoth alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail _Biomphalaria glabrata_. The LC50 of cuspanine [1] was 5 ppm and that of cuscline [2] was 20 ppm. There are only a few examples in the literature (8,9) where alkaloids exhibiting high toxicity to snails are observed. These two alkaloids also showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several carcinoma cell lines. The IC50's of **1** and **2** against HeLa epithelioid carcinoma cells were 2.5 and 8.5 mg/ml, respectively. In addition, they also inhibited the growth of BT-20 human breast carcinoma cells.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nAll the procedures were the same as previously described (2).\n\nIsolation of constituents.--The leaves of _A. paniculata_ were collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in February 1988, and identified by Dr. Jose R. Pirani, Instituto de Biociencias, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of this institute. The dried pulverized leaves were first extracted with CH2Cl2 followed by MeOH at ambient temperature. A subsequent molluscicidal bioassay using _B. glabrata_ indicated the CH2Cl2 extract to be active. The CH2Cl2 extract (2.983 g) was chromatographed over Si gel, using CH2Cl2, ErOAc, and MeOH. This process yielded 11 fractions. The bioactive fraction, eluted with EtOAc, was rechromatographed over Si gel (Lichroprep), affording cuspanine [1] (60 mg). The fractions eluted with MeOH after the same procedure gave cuscline [2] (200 mg).\n\nFigure 1: Molecular structure of 1,2,3,5,6-pentametrhodory-9-acridone [2] from **X**-ray crystallography.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n_Cupanine, 1-hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethyloxy-9-uridine_[1].--Yellow crystals: mp 164-166deg (from MeOH); uv l max (MeOH) nm (log e) 212 (3.84), 256 (4.83), 324 (3.78), 384 (3.60); ir l max (MeOH + AlCl3) nm 220, 250, 272, 340, 420; ir \\(v\\) max (KBr) cm-1 1635, 1620, 1570, 1520, 1290, 1210, 1030; 1H nmr (CDCl3, 500 MHz) d ppm 8.44 (1H, br s, NH), 8.06 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-8), 6.92 (1H, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-7), 6.23 (1H, s, H-4), 4.02, 4.00, 3.95, 3.90 (each 3H, s, OMe); 13C nmr (CDCl3, 125 MHz D ppm 181.14 (s, C-5), 159.41 (s, C-3), 155.53 (s, C-1), 154.52 (s, C-6), 138.06 (s, C-11), 135.02 (s, C-5), 133.72 (s, C-5), 130.27 (s, C-\n\n## Page 5\n\nwere acidified with dilute HCl, extracted with CHCl3, dried, and evaporated.

They are HeLa ATCC CCL 219, epithelioid cervix carcinoma from human, and BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma from human. Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air at 37deg. These human monolayer cultures were subcultured with a 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nThe cytotoxicity assays were performed by a microulture tetrazolium (MYT) (Sigma) method (12). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtitre plates at 4000-6000 cells/well, with various concentrations of the samples. After incubation, 50 ml MTT (3 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye was solubilized by adding 100 ml DMSO to each well, followed by gentle shaking. The extinction coefficient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photometer Labsystems, at a wavelength of 620 nm.\n\n## 2 Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dr. Jose R.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most active extracts afforded seven known compounds, including three chromanes, two furofuran in lignans and two flavone _C_-diglycosides. The most active compounds were the chromanes per-pectubusin A and 3.4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2-7-di-methyl-8-(2a-\"methyl-2a-\"butteroluethyl-2-(4\"-methyl-1',3\"-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbohydrate).\n\n## Introduction\n\n**V**\n\nChagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis) affects 16-18 million people, mostly from Central and South America, where 25% of the total population are at risk of infection [1]. The treatment of Chagas' disease is still a challenge, since the currently available drugs, nitrurilmox (Lampit(r), discontinued by Bayer), a nitrofuran derivative, and benzimidazole (Rochagan(r), Roche), a nitroimidazole derivative, have shown limited efficacy, strong side effects, and low effectiveness [2].\n\nThe _Peperomia_ genus belongs to the Piperaceae family and consists of approximately 1 700 species [3]. In contrast to the extensive studies involving compounds isolated from Piper species [4,5], only a few species of _Peperomia_ have been subjected to systematic phytochemical investigation. _Peperomia obtusifolia_ is a well-known ornamental plant distributed from Mexico to South America. A previous phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of _P. obtusifolia_ showed the presence of five phenolic compounds bearing methyl, premyl and geranyl groups [6].\n\nThis study describes the isolation and _in vitro_ evaluation of the trypanocidal activity against _Thypanosoma cruzi_ (Y-strain) and unspecific cytotoxicity of seven known compounds (Fig. 1) from the active fractions of the ethanol extracts of _Peperomia obtusifolia_ leaves and stems. This is the first report of the isolation of compound **2**, the chromanase 3.4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2-7-di-methyl-8-(2a-\"methyl-2a-\"butteroluethyl-2-\"butteroluethyl-8-(2a-\"methyl-2a-\"methyl-1',3\"-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbohydrate acid, from _Peperomia obtusifolia_.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n**V**\n\n### Plant material\n\nLeaves and stems of _Peperomia obtusifolia_ A. Diet-er were collected in Poos de Caldas, MG, Brazil and identified by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil). The voucher specimen (KATO 070) has been deposited at the Herbario do Estado \"Maria Eneyda P. Kaufmann Fidalgo\" (Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\nExtraction and isolation\n\nThe powdered air-dried leaves (600 g) and stems (64 g) were extracted at room temperature with EtOH (4 x 2 500 mL, 72 h each and 4 x 500 mL, 72 h each; respectively).\n\nThe crude leaves extract (39.6 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of H2O/MeOH (20 : 80 v/v) and partitioned using Hex (3 x 35 mL), Hex/EtOAc (30 : 70 v/v) (3 x 35 mL) and EtOAc (3 x 35 mL), which afforded EL-H, EL-HE, EL-E and EL-MH fractions, respectively. EL-H (15.5 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20-63 mm, 7 x 15 cm) eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc and EtOAc-MeOH (3 L and 1.5 L, respectively), yielding 26 fractions (170 mL each, A-1 to A-26). Compound **1** (50 mg) was obtained from A-7 (320 mg) by recrystallization in MeOH (45 degC).\n\nEL-HE (2.2 g) was submitted to low-pressure column chromatography over a C18 column (4 x 18 cm), under gradient elution (5-100% EtOH in H2O) (1.5 l) yielding 14 fractions (100 mL each, B-1 to B-14). B-7 (232.8 mg) after semipermeative reversed phase HPLC (C18, 10 mm, 250 mm x 21.2 mm, MeOH/H2O 65 : 35 v/v, flow-rate 16 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm), yielded **2** (40 mg, Rt = 19.8 min). Compounds **3** (6 mg, Rt = 7.8 min) and **4** (7.2 mg, Rt = 12.4 min) were purified from B-9 (160.0 mg) under the same conditions as for B-7.\n\nEL-MH (10.8 g) was subjected to low-pressure column chromatography over a C18 column (5 x 28 cm), under gradient elution (5-100% MeOH in H2O) affording 14 fractions (C-1 to C-14). C-8 and C-9 (165 and 168 mg, respectively) were pooled and then subjected to semipermeative HPLC (phenyl-hexyl, 10 mm, 250 mm x 21.2 mm, MeOH/AcOH aqueous 0.5%, 22 : 78 v/v, flow rate 14 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm) to yield **5** (23 mg, Rt = 20 min).\n\nThe stems ethanol extract (5.7 g) was dissolved in 60 mL of H2O/MeOH (20 : 80 v/v) and partitioned using hexane, EtOAc and n-BuOH (3 x 20 mL each) to give ES-H, ES-E and ES-B fractions, respectively. ES-H (2 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20-63 mm, 3 x 12 cm) eluted with hexane-EtOAc and an EtOAc-MeOH gradient (300 mL and 150 mL, respectively), to afford 13 fractions (50 mL each, D-1 to D-13). D-5 (60 mg) was purified using preparative TLC with toluene/hexane (20 : 80 v/v) yielding **6** (5 mg, Rf = 0.7) and **7** (2 mg, Rf = 0.75). For compounds **1, 2, 5-7**, the purity (> 99%) was determined by HPLC analysis using a diode-array detector (monitoring at l = 254 nm) and two different chromatographic conditions (C8 and C18 stationary phases). Melting points of compounds **3** and **4** were determined and were in accordance with literature values.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nHPLC and specific rotation analysis\n\nAnalytical and semiperaparative HPLC separations were performed using stainless-steel Phenomenex Luna(r) columns (250 x 4.6 mm I.D., 5 mm Cs and C18: 250 x 21.2 mm I.D., 10 mm; C18 and Pheny-hexyl; Phenomenex). Methanol was obtained from J.T. Baker. HPLC separations were carried out using a Varian Preparstar SD-1 equipped with a Rheodyne (Cotati) injector with a 2 mL sample loop and a Varian ProStar 320 UV-Vis detector. Specific rotations of the isolated compounds dissolved in chloroform were measured on a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter equipped with a Na lamp operating at 589 nm.\n\n### Trypanacidal assay [7]\n\nAn in vitro assay was performed measuring the proliferation of Y-strain epimastigotes growing in arsenic culture. The samples to be tested were stored as 1 mg/mL stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and were serially diluted in LIT medium before use. The crude extracts, fractions and pure compounds were tested at 0.4, 1.2, 3.7, 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 mg/mL, in triplicate, using 1 x 105 epimastigotes/well. The number of remaining viable protozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber following incubation at 28 degC for 72 h with the test samples. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and statistical data were determined with the probit analysis method using GW-BA-SIC 2.33 (Microsoft Software, 1987). The positive control benzimidazole (> 99% of purity by HPLC) was obtained from Rochagan(r) tablets (Roche Brazil).\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nThe unspecific cytotoxic activity was determined according to the method of Mosmann, with minimal modifications [8]. Briefly, Bally/c isogenic mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 3 mL of sodium thioglycolate 3%. The animals were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber 3 days after incubation. The peritoneal macrophages were extracted by injecting phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) followed by slight massage and suction using a syringe. The cells were transferred to a sterile tube in an ice bath and cellular suspension was prepared after centrifugation. The sediment cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/mL of streptomycin, 100 U/mL of penicillin and 5 x 10-2 M of b mercaptoethanol at density of 5 x 106 cells/mL (stock suspension). In a 96-wells microtiter trap, 100 mL of cells from the stock suspension and 100 mL of test solutions dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium (final concentrations: 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 mg/ml), were added. After incubation for 24 h at 37 degC and 7.5% CO2, 100 mL of an MTT solution (2.5 mg/mL) were added to each well and incubated for 3 h under the same conditions. The optical density (590 nm) of the formazan crystals dissolved in 2-propanol was measured and compared with the negative control (only RPMI). The positive control for the trypanacidal assay (benzindole) was also evaluated. All treatments were performed in triplicate and the IC50 values (with 95% confidence intervals), were determined by linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Software).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n### \\(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\)\n\nIn this work, we assessed the anti-tr trypanosomal activity of crude extracts from the leaves and stems of _Peperomia obtrustofluia_, and their fractions obtained by liquid-liquid partition against the epis-mastigate forms of the _Trypanosoma cruzi_ Y-strain.\n\nThe crude ethanol extract from the leaves of _b. obtrustofluia_ showed significant trypanacidal activity (IC50 of 4.3 mg/mL) when compared to the positive control benzimidazole (IC50 of 2.7 mg/mL) (0 Table 1). Thus, this extract was fractionated and all fractions EL-H, EL-HE, EL- and EL-MH (IC50 of 3.9, 0.2, 5.6 and 7.7 mg/mL respectively) were also active, with EL-HE being the most active with an IC50 of 0.2 mg/mL. The crude ethanol extract from the stems of _P. obtrustofluia_ showed lower activity than EL (IC50 of 23.2 mg/mL), nevertheless it was partitioned as well. All fractions were tested and the hexane (ES-H) and ethyl acetate (ES-E) fractions were the most active with IC50 values of 2.8 and 7.2 mg/mL, respectively.\n\nChemical investigations of the active fractions led to seven (1 - 7, 0* Fig. 1) known compounds: the chromases 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-dimethyl-8-(2\"-methyl-2\"-butenyl)-2-(4\"-methyl-1\"-3\"-pentediatol)-2H-1-benzopyran-6'-carboxylic acid (1) [9], per-pothuan A (6) [6] and calculifol (7) [6] [10]; the furofuran ligands 2-epigesalisation (3) [11] and sextentrum (4) [12]; and the flavone C-diglycosides isoswertistin-4'-methyl-ether-2\"a-l-rhamoside (**2**) and isoswertistin-2\"a-t-rhamoside (**5**) [13, 14]. The structures of 1 - 7 were confirmed by IR, MS, 1H-, 13C-NMR and 2D NMR spectral data, which were in agreement with the reported data for the respective compounds.\n\nCompounds **1, 6** and **7** had an optical activity [a]6: 0* (c. 1.0, CHCl3) suggesting a racemic mixture in the molecules bearing a chiral center at C-2. These results are in accordance with the data\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline\n**Part of the plant** & **Extract/fraction** & **IC50 (ug/mL) ± SD** \\\\ \\hline\n**Leaves** & EL & 4.3 ± 1.0 \\\\  & EL-H & 3.9 ± 0.5 \\\\  & EL-HE & 0.2 ± 0.4 \\\\  & EL-E & 5.6 ± 1.2 \\\\  & EL-MH & 7.7 ± 1.4 \\\\\n**Stems** & ES & 23.2 ± 8.0 \\\\  & ES-H & 2.8 ± 0.4 \\\\  & ES-E & 7.2 ± 3.0 \\\\  & ES-R & 132.0 ± 1.0 \\\\  & ES-MH & 24.4 ± 6.0 \\\\  & Benzimidazole(r) & 2.7 ± 0.5 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: In vitro trypanodidal activity of extracts and fractions from Peperomia obtrustofluia (Piperaceae) against epimastigotes forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ Y-strain®.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline\n**Compound** & **IC50 (uM) ± SD** \\\\  & **Trypanacida(r)** & **Cytotoxicity (Si)** \\\\ \\hline\n**1** & 27.0 ± 0.8 & 405.0 ± 5.0 (14.9) \\\\\n**2** & 678.2 ± 50.0 \\\\\n**3** & 93.5 ± 9.0 \\\\\n**4** & 289.1 ± 20.0 \\\\\n**5** & 620.1 ± 45.0 \\\\\n**6** & 3.1 ± 0.2 \\\\\n**7** & 47.5 ± 4.0 \\\\\n**8** & Benzidazole(r)** & 10.4 ± 0.5 \\\\\n138.0 ± 2.0 (109) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: In vitro trypanodial activity of the isolated compounds 1–7, and unspecific cytotoxicity of the most active compounds (1 and 6).\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\npreviously reported [6, 15]. This is the first report of the isolation of compound **1** from _P. obtusifolia_. It had previously been reported from _Peperomia ampliexiculis_ [9].\n\nThe trypanoidal activity of the isolated compounds was determined using benzimidazole as the positive control (IC50 of 10.4 uM, O **Table 2**). The chromanes **1, 6 and 7** showed better trypanoidal activity, with IC50 values of 27.0, 3.1 and 47.5 uM respectively, than the lignans and glycosylflavones isolated. The potent trypanoidal activity observed for these compounds bearing a benzopyran nucleus substituted with isoprenyl moieties supports our recent report which showed the trypanoidal activity of chromenes isolated from _Pipper gauidchaudiumum_ and _P. edumum_ and semisynthetic derivatives [7].\n\nEven though the furofuran lignans 2-episesalatin (**3**) and essearmin (**4**) had been isolated from the most active fraction EL-HE (IC50 of 0.2 uMg/mL, O **Table 1**) they showed weak activity, indicating loss of the trypanoidal activity during fractionation. The flavone C-diglycosides **2** and **5** isolated from the leaves of _P. obtusifolia_ did not display any trypanoidal activity (o **Table 2**). As observed for the inactive lignans **3** and **4**, the fur further chromatographic fractionation of the active EL-MH fraction (IC50 of 7.7 ug/mL) resulted in the isolation of inactive compounds. Despite the negative results obtained for the flavone C-diglycosides **2** and **5** as well as for lignans **3** and **4** in the trypanoidal assay, further studies of EL-HE and EL-MH could be promising for the search of new trypanoidal compounds.\n\nThe most active compounds **1** and **6** were also evaluated for their unspecific cytotoxicity in mammalian cells (murine peritoneal macrophages), and the obtained values indicated that chromanes were not toxic at the level of their trypanoidal activity (IC50 of 405.0 and 402.1 uM, o **Table 2**). Nevertheless, the cytotoxic activity of **1** and **6** was higher than that of benzimidazole (IC50 of 1138.0 uM, o **Table 2**), which was included in order to establish a comparison with the only drug available for the treatment of Chagas' disease. As selectivity is a relevant characteristic for defining lead molecules, the cytotoxicities were compared to the antiparasitic activities by calculating the SI (selectivity index) [16]. The SI values for **1, 6** and benzimidazole were 14.9, 130.4 and 109, respectively, suggesting that **1** and particularly **6** have good selectivity for _T. cruzi_ eplastigstopes when compared with benzimidazole.\n\nIn conclusion, the present investigation revealed that the bioassay-guided fractionation of extracts from the leaves and stems of _P. obtusifolia_ led to the isolation of premylated benzopyrans with potent anti-trypanosomal activity and a good selectivity index when assayed in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that Piperaceae species are an important source of new trypanoidal compounds. More extensive and detailed studies on the trypanoidal activity of natural chromanes as well as chromane derivatives should be undertaken in order to provide an understanding of structural requirements for biological activity.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank the financial support provided by FAPESP within the BIOTA/FAPESP - The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biotasp.org.br), ACL, JMBJ and SNL also thank FAPESP for providing scholarships.

Lung, colorectal and stomach cancer are among the most common in the world for both men and women. According to the World Health Organization cancer is responsible for 12% of the world's mortality [1]. Plants have a long history of use in treatment of cancer and they have provided some of the currently used effective anticancer agents such as vinblastine, vincristine, etoposide, teniposide, and\n\n## Page 4\n\npaclitaxel [2]. The analysis of the sources of new and approved drugs for the treatment of cancer shows that 60% of these drugs were shown to be of natural origin, being natural compounds or derivatives thereof [3].\n\n_In vitro_ model system with human cells is increasingly used to investigate mechanism of chemical-induced toxicity and for toxicity screening of new drug families. Among the chemical entities assayed against cancer cell lines, acridone alkaloids have been a target of study by researchers. The acridone alkaloids are known to have several bioactivities, including antimalarial activity [4, 5, 6], antiviral [7, 8], and cytotoxicity activity [9, 10, 11]. In this article, the isolation of 11 acridone alkaloids and three _N_-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives from _Swinglea glutinosa_ (Bl.) Merr. and their _in vitro_ cytotoxicity activity on several cancer cell lines are described.\n\n## 2 Results and discussion\n\nThe acridone alkaloids and _N_-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives were isolated from the methanol extract of the stem and fresh fruits of _Swinglea glutinosa_ (Bl.) Merr., respectively, and were identified on the basis of spectroscopic methods and comparison of literature data as: glycocitrine-IV (**1**) [12], 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10_H_)-one (**2**) [13] and 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone (**3**) [5], cithrasine (**4**) and citrusinine-II (**5**) [14], citrusinine-I (**6**) [15], 5-dihydroxyacronycine (**7**) [16], pyrazolo-foline (**8**) [17], dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl-2_H_-pyrano[2,3-_a_] acridin-12(7_H_)-one (**9**), 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxy-propan-2-yl)-11-methoxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-_b_]acridin-5(10_H_)-one (**10**) [13] and bis-5-hydroxyacronycine (**11**) [18], _N_-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (**12**), _N_-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethyl-4-acetyl-octa-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (**13**), and severine acetate (**14**) [19].\n\n_Swinglea_ is native to the Phillipine Islands but was introduced into Brazil where it grows well. _Swinglea_ belongs to the Aurantioideae subfamily [20], and it is known to contain _N_-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives and protolimonoids [19]. In the Aurantioideae, the relatively small representation of quinolones contrasts with a preferential accumulation of coumarins, acridones, amides, and flavonoids [21]. Thus, the range of compounds that were isolated from _Swinglea_ reinforces its position as a member of the Aurantioideae.\n\nNatural and synthetic acridones represent important antitumor drugs. A characteristic example is the natural acridone acronycine (**15**), which posses an IC50 in leukemia cells in the order of 25 \\(\\mu\\)M [22]. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a series of naturally occurring acridones have been studied to determine the effects of these compounds on the inhibition of cell growth and macromolecular biosynthesis of human promyelocytic leukemia cells [23]. Among 50 alkaloids tested, glyfoline (**16**) was found to be the most active compound (IC50 1.1 \\(\\mu\\)M) and 21 alkaloids were found to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 \\(\\mu\\)M), as compounds **6** (IC50 8.6 \\(\\mu\\)M), **7** (IC50 8.8 \\(\\mu\\)M), and **8** (IC50 7.1 \\(\\mu\\)M). Further studies of glyfoline congeners by [24] revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the 1-hydroxy and the peri-carbonyl function of the 1-hydroxy-9-acridone nucleus was an important determinant for their cytotoxicity. Other 15 acridones were examined as inducers of HL-60 cell differentiation. These cells were differentiated into mature monocyte/macrophage by \n\n## Page 5\n\natalaphyllidine (**17**), atalaphyllinine (**18**), and des-_N_-methylnoracronycine (**19**). The activities of NBT reduction (on a minimum of 200 cells), nonspecific esterase, and phagocytosis, were induced by 2.5 uM of **17**-**19**. After a 4-day treatment, **17**-**19** at 10 uM inhibited clonal proliferation of HL-60 cells by 28, 96, and 63%, respectively. The SAR from the results revealed again that hydroxyl group at C-1 had an important role, as well as a prenyl group at C-2 of the tetracyclic acridones [9]. The same 15 acridones were examined for their antiproliferative effect on monolayers and suspension of several types of cancer cell lines, human lung carcinoma (A-549), melanin pigment-producing mouse melanoma (B-16 melanoma 4A5), T-cell leukemia (CCRF-HSB-2), gastric cancer cell, and lymph-node metastasized (TGBC11TKB) [10]. As a result, atalaphyllidine (**17**), atalaphyllinine (**18**), des-_N_-methylnoracronycine (**19**), and 5-hydroxy-_N_-methylseverifoline (**20**) showed potent antiproliferative activity against tumor cell lines. The SAR established from the results revealed that a secondary amine, hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-5, and a prenyl group at C-2 played an important role for antiproliferative activities of the tetracyclic acridones [23].\n\nSome of the acridones isolated from _S. glutinosa_, i.e. compounds **6** (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 8.6 uM for HL-60), **7** (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 8.8 uM for HL-60), and **8** (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 7.1 uM for HL-60), possess the structural requirements for antiproliferative activity. This stimulated us to test these alkaloids on other types of cancer cell lines, the human lung carcinoma cell line,\n\n## Page 6\n\nCOR-L23, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7, the human melanoma cell line, C32, and normal human fetal lung cell line, MRC-5. The sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay was used to test cytotoxicity against all cell lines and vinblastine sulfate (Sigma) was used as a positive control. The IC50 values of antitumor activity of the eleven acridone alkaloids and three _N_-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives on COR-L23, MCF7, C-32, and MRC-5 are summarized in table 1. Unfortunately, in spite of their promising structural features, none of the acridone tested exhibited high level of cytotoxicity, with IC50 values ranging from 47.5 to 93.3 mM. In previous studies, di- and monoprenylate acridones were shown to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 mM) on human leukemic HL-60 cell. Examples are 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,4-bis(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone; with IC50 13.7 mM, and 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-5-methoxyl-10-methyl-9-acridone with (IC50 10.1 mM) [10]. However, acridone congeners **1**-**3** did not show significant activity on cancer cell lines COR-L23 (IC50: **1**>100, **2** 66.1, **3** 69.1 mM), MCF7 (IC50: **1**>100, **2** 70.4, **3**>100 mM) and C32 (IC50: **1**>100, **2** 70.1, **3** 86.9 mM). In addition, what was particularly surprising in our study was the lack of appreciable activity for compounds **6**-**8** (COR-L23, IC50: **6**>100, **7** 69.9, **8**>100 mM; MCF7, IC50: **6**>100, **7** 77.6, **8**>100 mM, and C32, IC50: **6**>100, **7** 83.9, **8**>100 mM) since they were found to be more active than acronycine on human leukemic HL-60 cells [10]. Examination of the preceding compilation and our data reveal some impediments to develop a qualitative understanding of structure-activity. Different investigators seldom utilize the same cancer cell lines and interspecific differences in the response of the test cells can easily mask any meaningful observation of SARs. The present results obtained from acridone alkaloids on cancer cell lines COR-L23, MCF7 and C-32 are reported here for the first time. Among the enormous variety of alkaloids\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline  & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{IC50 (μM)} \\\\ Compound & COR-L23 & MCF7 & C32 & MRC-5 \\\\ \\hline\n**1** & \\(>\\)100 & \\(>\\)100 & \\(>\\)100 & \\(>\\)100 \\\\\n**2** & \\(66.1\\pm 0.4\\) & \\(70.4\\pm 5.9\\) & \\(70.1\\pm 2.3\\) & \\(71.9\\pm 1.9\n\n## Page 7\n\nin the Rutaceae [21, 25], only evodiamine and rutaocarpine, indolopyridoquinazoline alkaloids, have been previously evaluated for antiproliferation activity on any of these cancer cell lines i.e. MCF7 [26]. They were found to possess pronounced cytotoxic activity. In order to find potential lead compounds, Rutaceous alkaloids deserve more attention as anticancer agents.\n\nThe _N_-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives were also tested on cancer cell lines COR-L23, MCF7, and C32. Amides **13** (IC50 28.6 mM) and **14** (IC50 12.3 mM) were active against COR-L23 and only **14** (IC50 34.0 mM) against MCF7. However, amides **13** and **14** exhibited a high level of cytotoxic activity against the normal human fetal lung cell line, MRC-5 with IC50 values of 7.2 and 0.66 mM, respectively. This is the first report of cytotoxic, activity of _N_-phenylethyl-benzamide, but their lack of selectivity precludes any clinical application. However, it is possible that analog could be developed that would show selectivity and these would be of greater interest as lead compounds.\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\n\n\n## 3 Experimental\n\n### General\n\nOptical rotations were measured using a Perkin Elmer 241.

The plant was identified by Prof. Dr Maira Ines Salgado. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos (HUFSCar) number 7110 at Departamento de Botanica of Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.\n\n### Isolation of compounds\n\n#### 3.3.1 Alkaloids.\n\nThe parts of the plant were extracted separately with \\(n\\)-hexane at room temperature for 3 days, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure at 40\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, this procedure was done three times to yield the hexane crude extract. The residue was extracted as the same way using MeOH to yield the \\(n\\)-hexane and methanol crude extract. The MeOH crude extract 60 g was fractioned by VCC over 1 kg of silica gel 60 (70-239 mesh, Merck) eluting with 1.5 L of the solvents: C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{14}\\) 100% (fraction 1), CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) 100% (fraction 2), CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) : CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH 3 : 1 (fraction 3); CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) : CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH 2 : 1 (fraction 4); CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) : CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH 1 : 1 (fraction 4) and CH\\({}_{3}\\)OH 100% (fraction 5). Fractions 2 and 3 were combined after analyses with TLC. The result was chromatographed on silica gel eluted with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\); the polarity was increased by addition of 5, 10, 13, 18, 20, and 25% of MeOH in a gradient system to yield 15 fractions. Lupeol was crystallized from the fractions 1-3. The fraction 5 was rechromatographed on Si gel eluted with \\(n\\)-hexane-acetone 1 : 3 and gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 60 x 4 cm\\({}^{2}\\); MeOH) yield alkaloids **1** (3.5 mg), **2** (16.3 mg), **3** (30.4 mg), **4** (11.2 mg), **7** (9.8 mg), **8** (13.4 mg), and **11** (5.4 mg). Further purification of fraction 9 using gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 45 x 3 cm\\({}^{2}\\); MeOH) followed by using of HPLC (column SHODEX ASAHIPAK GS-310 2G; flow rate at 3.0 mL min\\({}^{-1}\\); UV detection at 254 and 365 nm; MEOH as eluted) yield compounds **3** (7.3 mg), **5** (13.5 mg), and **6** (11.2 mg). Fraction 10 after rechromatographed on gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 30 x 3 cm\\({}^{2}\\); MeOH) afforded compound **9** (4.3 mg) and **10** (5.2 mg).\n\n\n\n## Page 9\n\n\n\n#### 3.3.2 \\(N\\)-phenylethyl-benzamide compounds.\n\nThe sliced fresh fruits were stirred with MeOH at room temperature for 3 days. The extract was evaporated under vacuum and residue partitioned into CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)-, EtOHAc- and \\(n\\)-BuOH-soluble fractions. Fractions CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) and EtOAc were combined, solvent removed and the residue (26 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, elution with a hexane-CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)-EtOAc-MeOH gradient afforded 09 fractions. Fraction 2 was twice rechromatographed (silica gel, hexane-CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) 4 : 1; then silica gel, hexane-Me\\({}_{2}\\)CO 3 : 1) to give **12** and a fraction containing **13** and **14**. The latter was rechromatographed as above, elution with hexane-EtOAc 7 : 1 yielded a mixture of **13** and **14**. The latter was rechromatographed as described before, elution with hexane-EtOAc 7 : 1 and then by HPLC (column SHODEX ASAHIPAK GS-310 2G; flow rate at 3.0 mL min-1; UV detection at 254 and 365 nm; eluted with CH\\({}_{2}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\)) affording compounds **13** (8 mg) and **14** (9 mg).\n\n### 3.4. In vitro _biological assays_\n\n#### 3.4.1. Cell lines.\n\nCancer cell lines used in this work were human lung carcinoma cell line, COR-L23, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7, the human melanoma cell line, C32 and normal human fetal lung cell line, MRC-5. The cells COR-L23, MCF7 and C32 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplement with 10% heated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% of 2 Mm l-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/streptomycin. MRC-5 were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified minimum essential medium) with 10% FBS, 1% of 2 Mm l-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in a 5% CO\\({}_{2}\\). According to their growth profiles, the follow densities of each cell were used: 1 x 10\\({}^{3}\\), 3 x 10\\({}^{3}\\), 3 x 10\\({}^{3}\\), and 2 x 10\\({}^{3}\\) cell/well for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5, respectively.\n\n#### 3.4.2. Preparation of cell suspension for assay.\n\nThe human cell lines were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The PBS was decanted and cells detached with 2.5 mL of trypsin (Sigma) and PBS was added to a volume of 10 mL. The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation (37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, 115 r.p.m. and 5 min) was resuspended in 10 mL of suitable medium to make a cell suspension. The cell density was counted by triplan exclusion in a hemocytometer and then diluted with medium to give the previously determined optimal densities for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5. The cell suspension (100 mL) from each cell were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C to allow the attachment. After 24 h the cells were treated with the pure compounds solutions. Each pure compounds was initially dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) and after they were diluted in medium to produce four concentrations of 50, 5, 0.5, and 0.05 mg mL-1.\n\n#### 3.4.3. Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay.\n\nThe antiproliferative SRB assay was performed to assess growth inhibition by a colorimetric assay that estimates cell number indirectly by staining total cellular protein with the dye SRB [27]. Cells were fixed by layering 100 mL of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA, Aldrich Chemical) on top of grown medium. Cells were incubated at 4\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 1 h, after which plates were washed five times with water, the excess water drained off, and the plates left to dry in air at room temperature. SRB stain (50 mL; 0.4 in 1% acetic acid) (Sigma) was added to each well and left in contact with the cells for 30 min, after which they were washed with solution\n\n## Page 10\n\nof 1% acetic acid and rinsed four times until only dye adhering to the cells was left. The plates were dried at room temperature and 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of 10 \\(\\mu\\)M Tris base pH 10.5 (Sigma) were added to each well to solubilize the dye. The plates were shaken gently for 2 min, and the absorbance of each well was read on a SLT 340 ATTC plate reader (SLT Labinstrument, Australia) at 492 nm. Cell survival was measured as the percentage absorbance compared to the control (nontreated cells). The IC\\({}_{50}\\) values were calculated from the PRISM program obtained by plotting the percentage of survival _versus_ the concentration and interpolated by cubic spine.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES), Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) for the financial support, Marcia Ortiz Mayo Marques from the Instituto Agronomico de Campinas and Maria Ines Salgado from the Departamento de Botanica of Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] A.D.

NF\\(\\kappa\\)B regulates the expression of several genes involved in carcinogenesis. These include anti-apoptotic, cytokines and cell cycle-regulatory genes. It is well established that the transcriptional factor NF\\(\\kappa\\)B is deregulated in many forms of cancer. Thus, agents that can suppress NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation have the potential of suppressing carcinogenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from _Alchornea glandulosa_ (Euphorbiaceae) and eight esters were synthesised. These compounds were evaluated against TNF-\\(\\alpha\\)-induced NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation with stably transfected 293/NF\\(\\kappa\\)B-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Gallates with IC\\({}_{50}\\) values in a range of 10-56 uM mediated inhibitory activity higher than gallic acid (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 76.0 \\(\\pm\\) 4.9 uM). In addition to inhibiting NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation, gallic acid mediated a modest cytotoxic effect, and some of the gallates affected cell viability at the tested concentrations. Based on these results, suppression of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis.\n\ngallic acid; NF\\(\\kappa\\)B pathway; cytotoxicity; 293/NF\\(\\kappa\\)B cells; _Alchornea glandulosa_; cancer chemoprevention 148010\n\n## Page 4\n\nGallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid), a secondary metabolite accumulates in nearly all plants, either in free form or part of tannins, is known to possess antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic properties (Aruoma, Murcia, Butler, & Halliwell, 1993; Fiuza et al., 2004; Kratz et al., 2008; Kroes, van den Berg, van Ulford, van Dijk, & Labadie, 1992; Kubo, Fujita, K. Nihei & A. Nihei, 2004). It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as salts and esters. Some ointments used to treat psoriasis and external hemorrhoids contain gallic acid (Garcia de Hombre & Perez Penate, 2006; Hatton, 2000). Gallic acid has two major functional groups, hydroxyls and a carboxylic acid, which can yield numerous esters and salt derivatives. Some galloyl compounds are used as antioxidants in food and can exhibit important roles in prevention of inflammatory and atherosclerosis responses by blocking activation of NF_k_B (Murase et al., 1999).\n\nNF_k_B consists of homo and heterodimeric protein complexes acting as a transcription factor, and is found in many animal cell types. It is involved in regulation of immune response and inflammation, cell lineage development, cell apoptosis, cell-cycle progression and oncogenesis due to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidised LDL and microbial antigens, and has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, cIAP, survivin, TRAF, COX-2, MMP-9, iNOS and cell cycle-regulatory components, whose products are involved in tumourigenesis (Aggarwal, Sethi, Nair, & Ichikawa, 2006; Chen, Castranova, & Shi, 2001; Melisi & Chiao, 2007; Thanos & Maniatis, 1995). Most carcinogens, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, or tumour promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, H2O2, have been shown to activate NF_k_B, and resulting tumours have misregulated NF_k_B activity (Baldwin, 2001). It is now well established that aberrant regulation of NF_k_B, and the signalling pathways that control its activity, are involved in cancer development and progression, as well as in drug resistance, especially during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Inoue, Gohda, Akiyama, & Semba, 2007). Blocking NF_k_B can cause tumour cells to stop proliferating, undergo apoptosis, or to become more sensitive to the action of antitumor agents (Frydrych & Mlejnek, 2008; Yamamoto & Gaynor, 2001). Thus, agents that can suppress NF_k_B activation have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis or tumourigenesis.\n\nIn the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from _Alchornea glandulosa_ Poepp and Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), and eight semi-synthetic esters were prepared. All the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity as well as potential to inhibit TNF-_a_-induced NF_k_B activation with stably transfected 293/NF_k_B-Luc human embryonic kidney cells.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Materials\n\nMethanol, _n_-hexane, ethyl acetate and _p_-dioxane were of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade (JT Baker). Column chromatography was carried out over silica gel (0.06-0.20 mm, Acros Organics). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). Preparative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system and a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional NMR experiments were \n\n## Page 5\n\nrecorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (\\({}^{1}\\)H) and 125 MHz (\\({}^{13}\\)C), using CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) and DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) as solvent (Aldrich). Alkyl alcohols and DCC were purchased from Aldrich. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and sulphorhodamine B (SRB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), antibiotic-antimycotic, hygromycin B, and MEM sodium pyruvate were purchased from Invitrogen Co. (Carlsbad, CA). Reporter Lysis Buffer, Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison). Tumour Necrosis Factor-\\(\\alpha\\) (TNF-\\(\\alpha\\)) was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Alcohol was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ).\n\n### Isolation of gallic acid\n\nThe leaves of _A. glandulosa_ were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guaqu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen (SP319257) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil).\n\nThe shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with _n_-hexane (3.5 L x 3) at room temperature and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L x 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrup residue, which was diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and then successively partitioned with EtOAc and _n_-BuOH. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the partition phases yielded 2.5 g and 0.8 g, respectively. The part of EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford 11 fractions (A1-A11). Fraction A2 (730 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : HOAc (7.5 : 92 : 0.5), UV detection at 265 nm; flow rate 15 mL min-1] to give compound **1** (335 mg). Compound **1** was identified as gallic acid based on analysis of the \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR data, as well as by comparison with authentic material in our laboratory (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Molecular structures of gallic acid (**1**) and semi-synthetic esters (**2–9**).\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\n\n\n### Synthesis of esters 2-9\n\nAfter being cooled at 5\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, the mixture of gallic acid (0.2 mmol) and alcohol (20 mmol) in _p_-dioxane (6.0 mL) was added to a solution of \\(N\\),_N_'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in _p_-dioxane (3.0 mL). The solution was stirred for 48 h, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned three times with EtOAc and then filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (three times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (three times), water (two times), dried over MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column using an isocratic system of CHCl3-MeOH (98 : 2) to give gallate esters **2-8**. Structures of the semi-synthetic esters, methyl gallate (**2**), ethyl gallate (**3**), _n_-propyl gallate (**4**), isopropyl gallate (**5**), _n_-butyl gallate (**6**), isobutyl gallate (**7**), _n_-pentyl gallate (**8**) and 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid (**9**), were established by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis (Figure 1).\n\nFor synthesis of ester **9**, gallic acid (20 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (5.0 mL) and anhydride acetic (5.0 mL) under hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, carried to dryness under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography with a mixture of CHCl3-MeOH (85 : 15) to give a product (**9**). The NMR spectroscopic data of **9** were compatible with 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid.\n\n### NF_k_B luciferase assay\n\nNF_k_B inhibition assay was conducted using a luciferase reporter gene bioassay as previously described (Homhual et al., 2006). Human embryonic kidney cells (293/NF_k_B-Luc) were used to monitor alteration of the NF_k_B pathway. This cell line is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct regulated by the NF_k_B response element. Transcription factor can bind to the response element when stimulated by TNF-a, allowing transcription of the luciferase gene. Luciferase reacts with substrate, emitting light that was detected using a luminometer. Cells were seeded (105 cells mL-1) on sterile white walled 96-well plates and grown to approximately 80% confluence by incubating for 48 h. Gallic acid and alkyl gallates were tested at 20 mg mL-1 following 1 : 3 serial dilutions. After treatment with tested compounds for 10 min, cells were incubated for an additional 6 h with or without TNF-a (5 ng mL-1). The cells were gently washed with PBS and kept at -80degC with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corporation). The luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay system from Promega following manufacturer instructions. Luciferase activity was monitored (LUMIstar Galaxy BMG), dose-response curves were constructed, and results were expressed as IC50 values (i.e. concentration required to inhibit TNF-a induced NF_k_B activity by 50%).\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nCytotoxicity was determined by the method of Skehan et al. (1990). The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and stained for 30 min with 0.4% (w/v) sulphorhodamine B (SRB) prepared in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM Tris base\n\n## Page 7\n\n[tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism(r) Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences between means were located using Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences between means at the 5% (\\(p<0.05\\)) level were considered significant. The data are expressed as \\(\\text{means}\\pm\\text{standard}\\) error.\n\n## 3 Results and discussion\n\nHerein we report cytotoxic properties and suppression of TNF-a induced NFkB activation of gallic acid (**1**) and eight esters (**2-9**) determined with stably transfected 293/NFkB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Table 1 shows the concentrations of gallates **1-9** required to inhibit NFkB-induced activation in 50% (IC50). _N_-Tosyl-L-phenylalaninyl-chlormethylketone (TPCK) was adopted as positive control, exhibiting \\(98.5\\%\\pm 0.5\\%\\) NFkB inhibition at 30 uM, with an IC50 value of about 5 uM. At the highest concentration tested (20.0 ug mL-1), gallic acid mediated a moderate cytotoxic effect (52.9% \\(\\pm\\) 3.5% survival), but none of the gallate esters significantly affected cell viability. The most cytotoxic compound evaluated was **6**, with \\(48.9\\%\\pm 3.3\\%\\) cell survival.\n\nAmong inhibitors of NFkB, salicylates, aspirin (Kopp & Ghosh, 1994), apigenin and curcumin (Gerritsen et al., 1995; Singh & Aggarwal, 1996) were reported to suppress activation of NFkB by preventing the degradation of the NFkB inhibitor (IkB), and therefore NFkB was retained in the cytosol.\n\nThe serine protease inhibitor TPCK can cause a complete block to NFkB activation. TPCK inhibits NFkB subunits processing and IkB degradation (Mellitis, Hay, & Goodbourn, 1993). It has also been demonstrated that TPCK inhibits DNA replication by G0-G1 growth arrest and thus promotes apoptosis by other cytotoxic stimuli (Kirillova, Chaisson, & Fausto, 1999).\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\nThe present study provides evidence that some gallates can act as inhibitors of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B. Methyl gallate (**2**) demonstrated the greatest activity. The inhibitory actions of gallates do not appear to result from non-specific cellular toxicity but rather are specific for NF\\(\\kappa\\)B-dependent gene transcription. In another study, it has been demonstrated that gallates can inhibit TNF-\\(\\alpha\\)-induced nuclear translocation of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B by way of a mechanism independent of I\\(\\kappa\\)B degradation (Murase et al., 1999).\n\nMore recently, prevention of atherosclerosis, cancer, anti-plasmodial and antioxidant activity of a group of galloyl compounds was described, as well as structure-activity relationships yielding cytotoxic properties (Fiuza et al., 2004; Jagan, Ramakrishnan, Anandakumar, Kamaraj, & Devaki, 2008; Locatelli et al., 2008; Murase et al., 1999; Na et al., 2006; Petronio et al., 2007; Saxena et al., 2008). Based on these encouraging intracellular responses, we suggest suppression of NF\\(\\kappa\\)B activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis, and further investigations related to the actions of gallates, especially in NF\\(\\kappa\\)B signaling pathway and _in vivo_ models, may provide new insights into the cancer chemopreventive ability.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis study is supported by a programme project P01 CA48112 awarded by the National Cancer Institute and project 04/07932-7 of the Biota-Bioprospecta Program funded by Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil.

The sample was dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure, dissolved in 4.0 ml of methanol and filtered through 0.22 mm membrane filter (PVDF Millipore(r)) into a _high performance liquid chromatography_ (HPLC). Val. The reference standard used in this work-casegrewin F and caseinum(r)--was purified and identified in the laboratories of Nucleo de Bioensaios, Biossinstee e Ecofisologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sao Paulo State University, Aaraquara, Brazil; for details see Santos _et al._ (10). The standard solutions were prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of caseinregwein F into a volumetric flask. After diluting with methanol, the standard solutions (0.0079, 0.0159, 0.0635, 0.2540 e 0.5080 mg/ml) were filtered through 0.22 mm membrane filter (PVDF Millipore(r)) into a HPLC vial before injections. Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Variany Proxst system (comprising a model 240 pump, a 140 autosampler and a 330 photodiode array detector), with control and data handling managed by Star50 Chromatography software. Analysis was conducted using a Phenomerex(r) Gemini C-18 column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 um) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile: methanol water (from 44:23:4 to 47:53:00, v/v, in 42 min) and acetonitrile: methanol (53:47), v/v, in 5 min); flow rate 0.8 ml/min; detection range 210-400 nm; injection volume 20 ml. Analysis was realized in triplicate.\n\n### Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis\n\nA 5.0 mg of dried extract was submitted to SPE (2 x 1 cm) from silica gel (60-200 mm; Merck(r):) activated charcoal (Synthe(r)) (1:1, w/v) eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate (95:05, v/v, 5.0 ml). The sample was dried and diluted in hexane to afford 1.0 mg/ml solution. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector using a DB-5 column (30 mx 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm). The carrier gas was He at a flow rate of 1.33 ml/min, split mode with ratio of 1:20 and injection volume of 1 ml. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 250degC, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 60degC, with an increase of 3degC/min, to 240degC. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted using the same system and conditions interfaced to a mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an ion trap detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The compounds were identified by their retention indexes, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes (11) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7.0 library and of the literature (11). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas.\n\n### \\({}^{1}\\)H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis\n\nDried extract was diluted in CDCl3 (50.0 mg/ml) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA(r) 500 11.4 T instrument with CHCl3 as internal standard.\n\n### Ethanolic extract emulsions\n\nThe ethanolic extract of _C.slyestris_ was dissolved in Tween 20 (20%). Ball-C male mice were treated with 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. The concentrations of the test were chosen based on the high solubility of the ethanolic extract in the Tween 20 (20%).\n\n### Purification and structure determination of casegrewin F\n\nDried and powdered leaves of _C.slyestris_ were extracted by stepping in ethanol. The dried extract obtained was separated by SPE on silica gel: activated charcoal and fraction SPE was separated further by normal-phase low-pressure column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. Fractions CC15-19 were purified by preparative reversed-phase (Cl3) HPLC to yield casegrewin F (850.0 mg). The structure of the compound was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. For details see Santos _et al._ (10). The Microfluidic purify of the caasgrewin F in the assays used was 98.6% (HPLC-UV detected at 235 nm).\n\n### Caseagrewin F emulsions\n\nCaseagrewin F (Figure 1) was emulsified in 6% Tween 80 for both assays in mice. The Ball-C male mice were treated with 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg of casegrewin F per kg body weight (D-w.). These concentrations were based on ethanolic extract from _C.slyestris_ in which doses of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. were used; since casegrewin F represents 4% of the ethanolic extract, we selected doses that are ~4% of the ethanolic extract doses.\n\n### Animals\n\nSix-week-old Ball-C male mice were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (22 +- 2degC) and humidity (55 +- 10% room humidity), in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized for 1 week, during which they had free access to a commercial diet (Purina(r)) and water. The study was conducted with approval of Brazilian Ethics Committee to Experimentation Animals (process CEP/FCF/CAr ndeg 01/2006).\n\n### Mutagenic chemical-Positive control\n\nCyclophosphamide (CP, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, Lot. No. 036K1225, purity 99%) was used as mutagenic agent in experiments. CP was diluted in 0.95x NaCl just before use and the animals were exposed to the chemical by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg b.w. in 0.3 ml.\n\n### Mutagenicity--MN test\n\n### Experimental design\n\nThe assays were performed using eight animals/group. Group 1 (negative control) mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection of 0.3 ml. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and was treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%). 0.6 ml by gavage, for 2 weeks and on day 15 the mice were injected i.p. with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl. Groups 4-9 were treated for 2 weeks by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with various concentrations of ethanolic extract (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) or casegrewin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.). These groups also received treatment with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl by ip on day 15. Bone marrow from each animal was collected 24 h after the last administration (12).\n\nThe bone marrow MN test was carried out as described by Schmid (13). All slides were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and coded to avoid observer bias. For each experiment point, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were scored to determine the percentages of micronucleated PCE. The ratio of PCEs to monochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) (PCEs/NCEs) was determined in 200 cells.\n\n### Genotoxicity--comet assay\n\nFor the comet assay, the experimental design was the same as for the MN test in mice. Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized capillary vials and kept on ice until use. The alkaline version of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) was performed as described by Singh (14). Briefly, 20 ml of blood was taken, homogenized with low-melting point agarose, spread on microscope slide pre-coated with normal melting point agarose and covered with a coverslip. After 5 min at 4degC, the coverslip was removed from slides and they were immersed in cold lysing solution (2.4 M NaCl: 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). 10 mM Tris, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 1% Triton-X, pH 10) for 24 h. After lysis, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber, covered with electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH plus 1 mM EDTA, pH 7-13) and left for 20 min for the DNA to unwind. The electrophoresis was run for 20 min (25 V and 300 mA), after which the slides were submerged for 15 min in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and fixed in 96% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were prepared in duplicate with ethidium bromide and 50 cells were screened per sample in a fluorescent microscope (ZEISS(r), Germany) equipped with an excitation filter of 515-560 nm, a barrier filter of 590 nm and a 40 objective. The level of\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structure of caseagrewin F.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nDNA damage was assessed by an image analysis system (TriTek CometScore(tm) 1.5, 2006) and the percentage of DNA in tail was obtained.\n\n#### Antimagenicity--MN test\n\n_Experimental design_ In Group 1 (negative control), mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and were treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with 0.6 ml Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%) by gavage, for 2 weeks, and on day 15 received CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.); the aim of this group is to ensure that Tween has no influence in possible DNA protective effect. Groups 4-9 were treated by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with solutions of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) and casegrewin F (0.16, 32.0, 6.3, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 2 weeks and, on day 15, CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p) was administered. Bone marrow was taken 24 h of CP after the injection (12). The MN test was performed as described previously for the mutagenicity assays.\n\n#### Antigonotoxicity--comer assay\n\nThe experimental design for the Comet assay was the same as for antimutagenicity MN test and the comet assay for antimuotoxicity was carried out as described for the genotoxicity assay. Recently, Collins _et al_. (15) described that when comet assay is performed in _in vivo_ experiments low concentrations of genotoxic agents are unlikely to induce significant cytotoxicity, they also affirm that a low comet assay DNA damage would be a better indicator that cells are alive than common cytotoxicity tests. In this context, to the comet assay we did not performed cytotoxicity test once at low concentrations, the compounds were not genotoxic and consequently did not present cytotoxicity that could influence in antigenotoxicity assay.\n\n#### Statistical analysis\n\nFor a statistical interpretation, results were analyzed with Sigma Stat 3.5, Systat, CA. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test data for normal distribution, in all assays performed in the study. Since the results did not a show normal distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. In mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays, the Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test was used to compare DNA damage with the negative control. In the MN test, the PCE/NCE ratio was evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis test. In antimutagenicity/antigenotoxicity assays, Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test was used to compare all groups tested with the Tween 20 (20%) plus CP group, to assess the decrease in DNA damage. To test whether any groups demonstrated significant reduction in DNA damage to basal levels, those groups were also compared with negative control by the Mann-Whitney \\(U\\) test.\n\n## Results\n\n### Identification of compounds in the extract\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum from extract showed signals with absorptions in d 1.98-2.09, 2.20-2.40, 3.43, 5.07-5.45, 6.25-6.75, similar to those described for casearins and other clerodane diterpenes isolated from _C.sylvestris_ (10,16-18). Both casearin U and caseargrewin F were identified in the extract. However, casearin U was not assayed in the present study. Quantitative High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector analysis demonstrated that the content of caseargrewin F in the extract was 40.0 mg/g. Additionally, the chromatogram (Figure 2) presented 29 peaks with UV spectrum similar to observed for casearins and caseargrewin F (\\(\\lambda_{\\max}=231\\)-236 nm). The results of chemical analysis suggest the presence of these clerodane diterpenes in the extract.\n\n#### Mutagenicity and genotoxicity--ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris\n\nThe results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) for ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ are shown in Table I. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were observed at 50 and 75 mg/kg (both \\(P\\) < 0.01). The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically significant variation, indicating that there was no cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow cells.\n\n#### Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris\n\nTable II shows the protective effect of the ethanolic extract from _C.sylvestris_ against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. Since Tween 20 (20%) was used to dissolve the ethanolic extract, in the vehicle control this solution was administered before the CP to ensure that it has no influence on the antimutagenic effect of the test group. Consequently, there is no difference between Tween 20 (20%) plus CP and positive control. When the protective effect was evaluated by the MN test, an antimutagenic effect was observed in mice treated with 6.25 (_P_ < 0.01) and 12.5 mg/kg (_P_ < 0.05). However, the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ did not reduce the DNA damage to the basal level. In the comet assay, the ethanolic extract from _C.sylvestris_ significantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 3.13 (_P_ < 0.01), 6.25 (_P_ < 0.01), 12.5 (_P_ < 0.05) and 25 mg/kg (_P_ < 0.05).\n\n#### Mutagenicity and genotoxicity--caseargrewin F\n\nThe results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ are shown in Table III. Clastogenicity and primary damage were observed at 3.8 mg/kg b.w. of caseargrewin F (both \\(P\\) < 0.05)\n\nFig. 2: Results from HPLC-DAD analysis. (**A**) Chromatogram of extract from the leaves of _Casearia syhestris_; asterisk (*) indicates peaks with UV spectrum similar to casearins and caseargrewin F. (**B**) Caseargrewin F UV spectrum.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nin, respectively, the MN test and comet assay. The parameter used to assess genotoxicity by comet assay was % DNA in tail. The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically significant variation, indicating that caseargrewin F was not cytotoxic to mouse bone marrow cells.\n\n#### Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of caseargrewin F\n\nThe antimutagenesis/antigenotoxicity assays were performed to determine if caseargrewin F protects DNA from inducible damage (CP, 50 mg/kg b.w.). Table IV shows the protective effect of caseargrewin F against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. In the positive control, water was administered before CP, in order to maintain the same conditions as in the test groups (gavage intake) while determining the DNA damage induced by the CP without protection. To verify that Tween 80 has no influence on the antimutagenic effect in the test group, we administered the emulsifying solution before the CP. The negative control was used to check basal levels of DNA damage. The caseargrewin F did not show a statistically significant protective effect when assessed by the MN test. However, in the comet assay, it significantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 0.63 (_P_ < 0.01), 1.3 (_P_ < 0.01) and 2.5 (_P_ < 0.01) mg/kg b.w.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\ngenotoxic at the highest dose of 3.8 mg/kg b.w. A similar result was obtained in a recent study that describes mutagenic and genotoxic activity at high concentrations of another clerodane diterpene assessed by the MN test and comet assay (22). Considering that comet assay detects genomic lesions that are susceptible to DNA repair while MN test reveals more drastically lesions in chromosome level (23), it is important to realize that the two highest concentrations of ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and at the high concentration case-argreiin F induced unrepairable DNA damage. A mutagenic effect of the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewini F could represent a potential antimuour property, as previous works on _C.sylvestris_ demonstrated strong antimuour activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (17) and its casearins (clerodane diterpenes) exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against V-79 tumour cells (18).\n\nInterestingly, in the comet assay, the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ was more efficient at preventing primary DNA damage at low concentrations (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). The molecules with non-mutagenic and/or antimutagenic properties could have antioxidant properties and, sometimes, may activate DNA repair pathways (24). They may act directly on the mutagenic process, by increasing the fidelity in DNA replication (desmutagens) or by stimulating DNA damage error-free repair (bio-antimutagenesis) (25). Additionally, ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ did not presented a dose-dependent response in both comet assay and MN test, and this result can be affected by various associated factors such as dependence of the effect of the substance on dose, the complexity of the test organism and the influence of simultaneous metabolic routes and enzymatic pathways (26). Caseargrewin F was not antimutagenic when assessed by the MN test, but showed an antigenotoxic dose-dependent response in the comet assay over the range of 0.63-2.5 mg/kg b.w. (Table IV).\n\nIn accordance with the present work, previous study has demonstrated that essential oil of _C.sylvestris_ has classetogenicity and anticlastogeneity in HTC cell line (27). Monoterpens and sesquiterpenes were identified in the essential oil (28) whereas in the present study, sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes were identified in the ethanolic extract. Among 15 sesquiterpenes identified in the ethanolic extract, 13 were previous identified in essential oil (11,28). The mutagenic and genotoxic activity as well as the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ could be related to the sesquiterpenes. Additionally, there are recent studies that describe sesquiterpenes as chemopreventive (27,29). However, we cannot exclude the potential biological effects of the clerodane diterpenes since caseargrewin F protected DNA from primary damage. Moreover, the use of mice instead of cell lines to assess protective effect of ethanolic extract could better verify absorption and metabolism of _C.sylvestris_ in a complex organism.\n\nRecently, natural products have been described to protect DNA from damage and cause DNA damage (30,31) as observed in the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F. Similar results were obtained in earlier studies and described these products as Janus compounds, referring to the mythological Roman god Janus, who had two faces in the same: one looking forward and the other backward (32). Comet assay also revealed that _C.sylvestris_ exhibited chemoprotective effects, but was not able to reduce the levels of DNA damage to negative controls values. Other studies suggested similar effects. Santos and Takahashi (33) demonstrated that selenomethionine, a selenium-derived antioxidant compound, was both genotoxic and antigenotoxic and reduced the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, but not to values as low as the negative control.\n\nCytotoxic events could lead to overestimation of the chemoprotective effects observed here. Thus, it is also important to consider that _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F did not exhibit cytotoxic effects alone neither in combination with the CP as observed in the PCE/NCE values. Likewise, the chemoprotective effects can be considered only in the concentrations that did not exhibit genotoxic effects, a recommendation of the publication of Zeiger (34). Thus, our results demonstrate that the benefits of using ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F as DNA protective compounds could be respectively safe at doses <50 mg/kg b.w. and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.\n\nWe conclude that the ethanolic extract of _C.sylvestris_ and caseargrewin F protects DNA against damage in low concentrations, which was carefully estimated by using MN test and comet assay. Keeping in mind that the same ethanolic extract and caseargrewin F also can cause DNA damage in high concentrations.\n\n## Funding\n\nFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) (2005/58472-9) to A.M.d.O.; Biota-FAPESP (2003/02176-7) to V.S.B; Biopropsecta (2004/07932-7) to D.H.S.S.; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento a Pesquisa (305615/2006-8) to C.P.S.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe wish to thank Maximino Antonio Boschi, Marcos Aparecido Dangona and Maria Izabel Feliciano for the excellent technical assistance.\n\nConflict of interest statement: None declared.\n\n## References\n\n- Gonzalez-Avila, M., Arriaga-Alba, M., de la Garza, M., del Carmen Hernandez Pretelin, M., Dominguez-Ortiz, M.

Silva,a H. B. Napolitano,a,b J. Ellena,a W. C. Rocha,b P. C. Vieira,b G. Olivaa and O. H. Thiemanna\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe title acid, C16H20O5, was extracted from _Adiscanthus fusciformis_ (_Rutaceae_) and is shown to inhibit adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) enzyme activity. This compound crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. There is one hydrogen bond, with O_D_'*O_A_ = 2.6238 (12) A and O_D_-H_*O_A_ = 171.1 (17)deg involving the COOH group, forming a cyclic dimer about a center of symmetry. The packing of the molecules is additionally stabilized by one C-H_*O_[_C_'*O_A_ = 2.9820 (16) A and C_D_-H_*O_A_ = 101.8 (10)deg] and two C-H_*_p_ intermolecular hydrogen bonds.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe title carboxylic acid, (I), has been investigated because of its interesting inhibitory activity against adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) from _Leishmania tarentolae_ which is a member of the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) family. The PRTases are responsible for the salvage of purine, pyridine and pyrimidine nucleotides, as well as aromatic amino acids. Most organisms synthesize adenine nucleotides by both the _de novo_ and the salvage pathways. In contrast, protozoan parasites are strict purine nucleotide auxotrophs because of the absence of a purine _de novo_ biosynthetic pathway (Berens _et al._, 1995). Therefore, these microorganisms are absolutely dependent on scavenging pre-formed purine nucleotides from the host or the media (Ullman & Carter, 1997). To look for new potential anti-leishmania drugs, we used the APRT from _L. tarentolae_ as a model system to investigate the inhibitory capacity of _A. fusciformis_ extracts. The screening was performed using a spectrophotometric assay (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1980); the IC50 of pure compound (I) is 147 u_M_. In view of this interest, we have extracted the title compound, (I), and present here its crystal structure.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe study of the role of a protein in the asymmetric unit is a key to understanding the role of a protein in the asymmetric unit. The study of the role of a protein in the asymmetric unit is a key to understanding the role of a protein in the asymmetric unit.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n1983). The benzene ring C4-C9 in the central part of the molecule is very nearly planar, the maximum deviation of any of its atoms from the least-squares plane describing them being 0.0051 (8) A, while the average deviation is 0.0030 (9) A. Atoms (C2, C3, C16, O17, O18 and O19) around the benzene ring are coplanar [r.m.s. deviation 0.0535 (10) A]. Thus, the structure exhibits a planar central moiety, a typical structural feature observed in anti-leishmania inhibitors (Chan-Bacab & Pena-Rodrigues, 2001).\n\nSeveral packing features may be noted (Spek, 1990). There are classical intermolecular hydrogen bonds [O21-H21-O20]; symmetry code: (i) \\(\\frac{1}{2} - x\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2} - y\\), \\(1 - z\\)] between the COOH groups of neighbouring molecules, forming a centrosymmetric dimer (Fig. 2). O21-O20\\(i\\) is 2.6238 (12) A and O21-H21-O20\\(i\\) is 171.1 (17)deg.\n\nThere is also a weak C16-H16\\(b\\) * 0.21i [symmetry code: (ii) \\(x\\), \\(-y\\), \\(z - \\frac{1}{2}\\)] intermolecular hydrogen bond that is responsible for stabilization of the infinite parallel chains (Fig. 3).

These bacteria are responsible for producing two-thirds of the commercially available antibiotics [2, 3]. Most antibacterial species explored commercially were isolated from the soil. However, after decades of bioprospecting antibacterials from this environment, it is becoming more difficult to obtain strains producing novel bioactive metabolites [4]. Thus, many companies have turned the search for microbial producers of novel antifungal compounds to other environments such as hydrothermal vents,\n\n## Page 2\n\nmarine environments, tropical rain forests, and microbial symbionts associated with plants and animals hosts [5, 6]. For example, the occurrence of actinobacteria associated with marine sponges and the fact that such strains produce compounds with antimicrobial activity confirms this potential [7, 8, 9]. In addition, endophytic actinobacteria are also explored for their capacity to produce antimicrobial compounds [10, 11, 12].\n\nSeveral studies have focused on the association between actinobacteria and insects from an ecological perspective [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. On the other hand, few studies have focused on the multitude of chemical compounds that are involved in such interactions [26]. The best studied example is the symbiosis between actinobacteria and fungus-growing ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: tribe Attini). In this association, the actinobacteria are found on the ants' integument and produce antimicrobial compounds that help the ants to suppress the microfungus _Escovopsis_ sp. [13, 14]. This fungus is considered a specialized parasite of the ant cultivar and causes negative impacts to the ant colony [27].\n\nActinobacteria isolated from the integument of attine ants are generally classified in the genus _Pseudonocardia_ and _Streptomyces_. Bioactive molecules have already been isolated and characterized from actinobacteria isolated from several attine genera [26]. _Pseudonocardia_ isolated from _Acromyrmex octopinosus_ and _Apterostigma dentigerum_ are known to produce several compounds like (i) dentigerumycin, a complex compound active against _Candida albicans_ and _Escovopsis_[28]; (ii) a nystatin-like antifungal [29]; (iii) the novel quinone pseudonocardones A-C active against the malaria causal agent _Plasmodium berghei_[30]; (iv) the already known antibiotics 6-deoxy-8-O-methylrabelomycin and X-14 881, both active against _Bacillus subtilis_ and _P. berghei_[30]. In addition to _Pseudonocardia_, actinobacteria in the genus _Streptomyces_ are also found on the integument of _Acromyrmex_ workers and were shown to produce (i) candidin, active against _Escovopsis_ sp. [29, 31, 32, 33, 34], (ii) antimycins active against _Escovopsis_ sp. [32, 33, 34], and (iii) actinomycin D, actinomycin X2 and valinomycin that are active against _B. subtilis_[32].\n\nPoulsen [35] suggested that the attine ant-microbe association is little explored regarding the search for new antimicrobials. The author highlights the various symbiotic associations between attine ants and microorganisms as a promising source for drug discovery, especially those with antimicrobial activity. Here, we explored the antimicrobial potential of actinobacteria isolated from the integument of _Trachymyrmex_ fungus-growing ants and demonstrate the action against different medically important _Candida_ species. We also report two previously described urauchimycins from a _Streptomyces_ strain and emphasize the newly discovered anti-_Candida_ activity of these compounds.\n\n## 2 Material and Methods\n\n### Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification\n\nTwelve _Trachymyrmex_ colonies were collected in different Brazilian biomes (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material available online at [http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/835081](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/835081)). Colonies were carefully excavated in order to reach the first fungus garden chamber. Fungus garden with the tending workers and brood was sampled using an alcohol-flamed spoon and stored in sterile plastic containers. All containers were kept in a cooler during transport to the laboratory where they were maintained at 25degC.\n\nFrom each colony, we randomly selected four workers for actinobacteria isolation. Then, the propleural plates were scraped with a sterile needle under a low power stereomicroscope. All ants used in the present study had a visible, whitish covering on the propleural plates. Scrapings were plated on SCN agar (in g \\(\\cdot\\) L\\({}^{-1}\\): 10.0 starch, 0.3 casein, 2.0 KNO3, 2.0 NaCl, 2.0 K2HPO4, 0.05 MgSO4, 7 H2O, 0.02 CaCO3, 0.01 FeSO4. 7H2O and 18.0 agar supplemented with 0.05 Nystatin) [36]. After scraping, the entire body of all workers was inoculated on SCN agar. All plates were incubated at 25degC for 30 days. From each sampled _Trachymyrmex_ colony, one representative strain was selected from each morphotype obtained. The strains were subcultured in YMA (in g \\(\\cdot\\) L\\({}^{-1}\\): 3.0 yeast extract, 3.0 malt extract, 5.0 peptone, 10.0 glucose, 18.0 agar) and stored at \\(-80\\)degC in 15% glycerol.\n\nWe used a molecular approach to provide taxonomic affiliation to actinobacteria strains. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method of Sampaio et al. [37]. We carried out 16S rDNA PCR with the universal primers 27F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-3') and 1492R (5'-TACGGTTACCTTTGTTACGACTT-3') [38]. Reactions were conducted in a final volume of 25 \\(\\mu\\)L and contained 1 \\(\\mu\\)L of diluted DNA template (1:10), 2.0 \\(\\mu\\)L of each primer (10 mM), 2.5 \\(\\mu\\)L of 10X buffer, 1.0 \\(\\mu\\)L of MgCl2 (50 mM), 4.0 \\(\\mu\\)L of dNTPs (1.25 mM each), 0.2 \\(\\mu\\)L of Taq polymerase (5 U/\\(\\mu\\)L), and 12.3 \\(\\mu\\)L of ultrapure water. Amplicons were cleaned up with _GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit_ (GE Healthcare). Forward and reverse sequences were generated using the same primers, along with an internal primer U519F (5'-CAGCMGCCGGCGTAATWC-3'). Sequences were generated using _BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit_ (Life Technologies) in an ABI 3130 sequencer and manually edited in BioEdit v. 7.1.3 [39]. Contigs were compared with those available in the databases NCBI-GenBank ([http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) and Ribosomal Database Project (RDP, [http://rdp.cmc.msu.edu/](http://rdp.cmc.msu.edu/)). Sequences generated in the present study were deposited in NCBI-GenBank (accessions KC480554-KC480557).\n\nA phylogenetic analysis was carried out in order to determine the taxonomic affiliation of strain TD025. Sequences of closest relatives were retrieved from the NCBI-GenBank and the RDP Project and aligned in ClustalW. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in PAUP v. 4.0 [40]. Genetic distances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model of nucleotide substitution [41]. Robustness of the relationships was estimated from 1000 bootstrap pseudocircles.\n\n### Organic Extracts and Antifungal Assays\n\nAll actinobacteria were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 50 mL of modified MPE medium (in g \\(\\cdot\\) L\\({}^{-1}\\): 5.0 soy flour,\n\n## Page 3\n\n20.0 glucose, 5.0 of NaCl, 4.0 CaCO3) [42]. Each flask was inoculated with five mycelium disks (1 cm in diameter) cut from a previously grown culture and then incubated at 28degC for two days on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. From this culture, 10 mL was inoculated in two Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 100 mL of the same medium and incubated for five days on the same conditions. After incubation, the fermented broth was separated from the mycelium by centrifugation and partitioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the EtOAc extracts were diluted in RPMI-1640 culture broth containing 10% DMSO and used in the antimicrobial assays.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated against the yeasts _Candida albicans_ CBS 562, _Candida dubliniensis_ CBS 7987, _Candida glabrata_ CBS 138, _Candida krusei_ CBS 573, _Candida parapsilosis_ CBS 604, and _Candida tropicialis_ CBS 94. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the microdilution method according to the M27-A2 standard of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [43].\n\n### Isolation and Characterization of the Bioactive Compounds of Strain TD025\n\nThe actinobacteria strain that exhibited both a broad antifungal spectrum and lower MIC values was strain TD025. In order to identify the compounds responsible for the observed results, the strain was cultured in 5 L of modified MPE medium and the extracts were obtained as described.\n\nThe fermented broth (5 L) was separated from the cells by centrifugation and portioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The crude extract, a dark green oil (1.40 g), was separated by means of column chromatography using silica gel 60 eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc as the elution gradient, yielding 8 fractions. All fractions were submitted to antimicrobial assays against _C. albicans_ following the procedure described above. The most active fraction (67.5 mg) was subjected to preparative TLC (thin layer chromatography) eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7:3) two times, yielding 3 subfractions. The subfractions obtained were submitted to antimicrobial assays against _C. albicans_. The most active subfraction was submitted to semipreparative HPLC separations carried out in a Shimadzu (LC-6AD apparatus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-MI0Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP). The separation was carried out using VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18 column eluted with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.01) at a flow rate of 3 mL min-1, yielding compounds **1** and **2**. The isolated molecules were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic experiments recorded on a BRUKER DRX-400 spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard.\n\n### Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Fungicide Concentration of Bioactive Compounds\n\nAfter isolation and determination of the structure of the targeted compounds, they were evaluated for antimicrobial activity following the method described previously. Besides the MIC determination, we also evaluated the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The MFC was determined by inoculating Sabouraud dextrose medium with 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of the contents of each of the wells where there was growth inhibition of yeast, the MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the substance capable of preventing the onset of colony forming units.\n\n## 3 Results and Discussion\n\n### Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification\n\nSeveral actinobacteria colonies were observed after incubation of isolation plates. We selected just one morphotype of each per ant colony, rendering a total of 24 strains out of 12 _Trabymyrmex_ spp. nests (Table S1). Four actinobacteria genera were identified and _Streptomyces_ was the most abundant taxon (Table I), corresponding to 66.67% of the strains. It is assumed that the main actinobacteria associated with the integument of attire workers is the genus _Pseudonocardia_[14, 15, 16, 20]. However, several authors have demonstrated the isolation of actinobacteria other than _Pseudonocardia_ on the integument of attire ants [17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 29, 31]. The prevalence of _Streptomyces_ and absence of _Pseudonocardia_ among our isolates may be due to the culture medium used [44]. The SCN medium is suitable for the isolation of fast-growing actinobacteria, but according to other authors [13, 14, 15, 16], the use of a low-nutrient medium, such as chitin agar, may provide the recovery of _Pseudonocardia_ strains.\n\nIn eight out of 12 ant colonies, we obtained more than one actinobacteria morphotype (Table S1). From colony CTL080820-02, the two morphotypes isolated from two different workers were identified as the same actinobacteria species (Tables S1 and 1). On the other hand, different actinobacteria species were isolated in the seven remaining colonies. We also observed the occurrence of different actinobacteria strains in a single worker (Tables S1 and I). This result demonstrates the diversity of actinobacteria present on the integument of these ants (Table S1, nests SES08091I-04 and SES080924-01).\n\nThe 16S rDNA sequence of strain TD025 showed 99% similarity with sequences of several species of the genus _Streptomyces_ deposited in the databases. For a better characterization, we performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure I). The result suggests a differentiated phylogenetic position for strain TD025 when compared with the remaining sequences. This preliminary analysis allowed us to assign this strain as belonging to the genus _Streptomyces_, with _S. citratus_ as the closest relative strain (Figure I). However, more refined phylogenetic analyses, along with morphological and physiological studies, are necessary to ensure the identification of TD025 to the species level.\n\n### Screening for Antifungal Activity\n\nOur screening for antifungal activity revealed that seven out of 24 extracts (29.16%) inhibited the growth of at least one _Candida_ species. _C. albicans_ was the most sensitive yeast and was \n\n## Page 4\n\ninhibited by seven extracts with MIC ranging between 10 and 1000 \\(\\mu\\)g\\(\\cdot\\) mL\\({}^{-1}\\) (Table 2). The yeasts _C. glabrata_ and _C. tropicalis_ were the most resistant strains, being inhibited by one and two actinobacteria extracts, respectively, with MIC values of 1000 \\(\\mu\\)g\\(\\cdot\\) mL\\({}^{-1}\\) (Table 2).\n\nExcept for strain TD034 identified as _Amycolatopsis decaplanina_ (Table 1), the other actinobacteria exhibiting antimicrobial activity were identified as belonging to the genus _Streptomyces_. This genus is recognized as the largest producer of antibiotics because from approximately 3,000 known antibiotics obtained from actinobacteria, the genus _Streptomyces_ contributes with 90% of this total [45].\n\nThe extracts of _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025 and _Streptomyces crystallinus_ TD027 showed activity against all yeast strains except for _C. glabrata._ These extracts were effective against _C. albicans_ and _C. krusei_ and showed low activity against _C. tropicalis_ (Table 2). More interestingly, both strains were isolated from the same colony but from independent workers (Table 1). Because lower MICs were obtained for the extract of _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025, this strain was selected to verify the chemical compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity.\n\n### Bioactive Compounds of Streptomyces sp. TD025.\n\nChromatographic procedures revealed that EtOAc extract from TD025 contains two compounds (**1** and **2**, Figure 2). Compounds **1** and **2** exhibited typical NMR data of urauchimycins (Figures S1 and S2). Their NMR data are in agreement with those previously reported by Imamura et al. [46]. Although these urauchimycins (**1** and **2**) have already been isolated, they have never been tested on various species of _Candida_ as carried out in the present study.\n\nThe \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **1** showed 22 carbon signals: four carbonyls (\\(\\delta\\) 179.0, \\(\\delta\\) 170.6, \\(\\delta\\) 169.8, and \\(\\delta\\) 158.7), three quaternary sp\\({}^{2}\\) carbons (\\(\\delta\\) 150.6, \\(\\delta\\) 127.4, and \\(\\delta\\) 112.8), three methine aromatic carbons (\\(\\delta\\) 124.8, \\(\\delta\\) 120.6, and \\(\\delta\\) 119.0), two sp\\({}^{3}\\) methylene group (\\(\\delta\\) 35.6 and \\(\\delta\\) 30.5), three sp\\({}^{3}\\) methine groups (\\(\\delta\\) 54.0, \\(\\delta\\) 50.1, and \\(\\delta\\) 32.4), three oxymethinic groups (\\(\\delta\\) 77.1, \\(\\delta\\) 76.3, and \\(\\delta\\) 70.9), and four methyl groups (\\(\\delta\\) 18.4, \\(\\delta\\) 18.4, \\(\\delta\\) 15.1, and \\(\\delta\\) 11.4). Two carboxylic carbons \\(\\delta\\) 170.6 and \\(\\delta\\) 173.9 showed correlations with different hydrogens of the structure, showing a dilatone system of nine members, typical of the antimycin class.\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectrum showed a singlet at \\(\\delta\\) 8.50, assigned to a hydrogen bounded to a carbonyl group and three aromatic hydrogens at \\(\\delta\\) 8.55 (dd, \\(\\delta\\) 81 and 1.2 Hz), \\(\\delta\\) 7.24 (dd, \\(J\\) 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), and \\(\\delta\\) 6.92 (t, \\(J\\) 8.1 Hz), suggesting a 1,2,3 trisubstituted aromatic ring. The substance was identified as urauchimycin A by comparison with the literature data [46].\n\nThe \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of **2** were very similar to those observed for compound **1**. Differences were observed in chemical shifts of the hydrogen of the methyl and methylene\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\hline \\hline Isolate Id & bp\\({}^{1}\\) & NCBI-GenBank closest relative & Coverage & \\% & Accession \\# \\\\ \\hline TD016 & 1251 & _Nocardia neocaledoniensis_ DSM 44717 & 100 & 100 & JF79731I \\\\ TD017 & 1248 & _Nocardia neocaledoniensis_ DSM 44717 & 100 & 100 & JF79731I \\\\ TD018 & 1184 & _Streptomyces zoamyceticus_ NRLL B-2038 & 99 & 100 & NR044144 \\\\ TD019 & 1342 & _Streptomyces allvochromogenes_ NBRC 3404 & 99 & 100 & AB184761 \\\\ TD020 & 1167 & _Streptomyces samanensis_ NBRC 14239 & 99 & 99 & NR041I60 \\\\ TD021 & 1250 & _Streptomyces mauvecolor_ NBRC 13854 & 100 & 99 & NR041I54 \\\\ TD022 & 1254 & _Streptomyces lydicus_ CGMCC 4.1412 & 100 & 100 & JN566018 \\\\ TD023 & 1246 & _Streptomyces_ sp.

Based on published data [46] compound **2** was identified as Urauchimycin B, an isomer of compound **1**.\n\nUrauchimycins belong to the antimycin class, a group of well-known antifungals. Antimycins act by inhibiting the electron flow in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [47]. Antimycins have been previously identified in _Streptomyces_ isolated from the integument of atting ants [32, 33, 34]. Schoenian and colleagues [32] detected the well-know antimycins Al-A4 in 50% of the actinobacteria identified as _Streptomyces_ isolated from workers of several _Acromyrrmex_ species. These data along with the rare antimycins identified in the present study indicate that this chemical class is often produced by _Streptomyces_ associated with atting ants. Compounds belonging to this class may have an important role in the atting ant-microbe association.\n\nAnother antifungal compound widely distributed in _Streptomyces_ associated with atting ants is candididin [31, 32, 33, 34], which was not detected in _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025. It is possible that candididin was lost in one of the purification steps of the AcOEt extract or it is not produced by this strain.\n\nUrauchimycins A and B were previously isolated from _Streptomyces_ sp. Ni-80 isolated from a marine sponge in Urauchicove, Irimore, Japan. These substances were the first antimycins having an odd number of carbons and a branching side chain [46]. Imamura et al. [46] suggested that such structures are the result of an evolution of actinobacteria in the marine environment, which could have resulted in a change in their secondary metabolism.\n\nIn 2006, two new urauchimycins were described: urauchimycin C, isolated from _Streptomyces_ sp. Bl751 from marine sediment, and urauchimycin D, isolated from _Streptomyces_ sp. AddM21 from soil [48]. In the study by Imamura and coworkers [46], the urauchimycins A and B inhibited the morphological differentiation of _C. albicans_ up to a concentration of 10 \\(\\mu\\)g\\(\\cdot\\) mL\\({}^{-1}\\). Urauchimycins C and D showed no inhibitory activity against _C. albicans_, _Mucor miehei_, and bacteria [48].\n\nThe study of antimicrobial activity of urauchimycins A and B was restricted to _C. albicans_ in the work by Imamura and colleagues [46]. The reisolation of these molecules in the present study allowed a better evaluation of its spectrum of\n\nFigure 1: Phylogenetic relationships of strain TD025 (in bold) isolated from the integument of _Traclymyrrnex_ sp. The phylogeny was inferred from 165 rDNA sequences retrieved from the NCBI-GenBank using the neighbor-joining algorithm and the Kimura 2-parameter model of nucleotide substitution. Numbers in parentheses correspond to GenBank accessions. Numbers on branches indicate the bootstrap support after 1,000 pseudoreplicates. The scale bar denotes the number of substitutions per site.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nactivity. The urauchimycins from _Streptomyces_ sp. TD025 presented MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nystatin for _C. albicans_ and _C. glabrata_ (Table 3). Urauchimycin B showed inhibitory activity against all _Candida_ strains evaluated, showing MIC similar to those provided by nystatin.\n\nUrauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity against _Candida_ spp. with MIC values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin, which indicates the potential for medical use. For many years, antimycins were used for the treatment of human infections, but due to its mechanism of action and associated side effects, its use in human treatment was discontinued [47]. However, with the pressing need for new antifungal agents that complement or substitute for the scarce products available on the market, it is interesting and necessary to determine the toxicity presented by urauchimycin B, to assess whether it can be used as an antifungal agent for humans and animals. In addition, evaluation of the isolated compound against _Candida_ species resistant to commercially available antifungal agents should be performed to confirm the potential of this relatively unexplored antifungal.\n\nHere we show that _Trachymymrex_ ants, one attine genus understudied with respect to its microbial symbionts, harbor antimicrobial-producing actinobacteria. As observed by other authors [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33], the present study demonstrates that\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{Isolate ID} & _C. albicans_ & _C. dubliniensis_ & _C. glabrata_ & _C. lrusei_ & _C. parapsilosis_ & _C. tropicalis_ \\\\  & CBS 562 & CBS 7987 & CBS 138 & CBS 573 & CBS 604 & CBS 94 \\\\ \\hline TD016 & * & * & * & * & * & * \\\\ TD017 & * & * & * & * & * & * \\\\ TD018 & * & * & * & * & * & *\n\n## Page 7\n\nactinobacteria of attine ants are able to produce antifungal compounds active against other fungal species and not only against the specific fungal parasite _Escovopsis_.\n\nMoreover, our study corroborates previous work [35] that suggests the attine ant-microbe association is a promising source of microorganisms that produce active metabolites. The few recent studies that focused on the chemical characterization of bioactive compounds produced by actinobacteria associated with attine ants support the potential isolation of novel molecules with biological activity [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Thus, an exploration program of isolation of bioactive molecules from actinobacteria from attine ants certainly will result in the discovery of novel compounds with activity against microorganisms that are potentially pathogenic to humans.\n\n## 4 Conclusion\n\nAs suggested by Poulsen [35], we found that the integument of _Trachymrymex_ ants is a potential source for the isolation of actinobacteria that produce bioactive molecules. The isolation of Urauchimycins A and B enabled, for the first time, the evaluation of their activity against various _Candida_ species. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity and MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nystatin. Toxicity studies and _in vivo_ activity should be carried out in order to verify the potential use of this molecule in the treatment of fungal infections.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo), CNPq/INCT (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico), and NSF IRFP (United States National Science Foundation International Research Fellowship Program no. 07012333) for financial support.

Five chromenes were isolated from _Piper gaudichaudianum_ and _P. aduncum_, and a further seven derivatives were prepared using standard reduction, methylation and acetylation procedures. These compounds were assayed _in vitro_ against optimastigative forms of _Typanosoma cruzi_, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The results showed that the most of the compounds, especially those possessing electron-donating groups as substituents on the aromatic ring, showed potent trypanocidal activity. The most active compound, [(2S)-methyl-2-methyl-8-(3\"-methyl-2\"-enyl)-2(4\"-methyl-3\"-enyl)-2_H_-chrome-6-carboxylate], was almost four times more potent than benzindazole (the positive control) and showed an IC50 of 2.82 _m_M. The results reveal that chromenes exhibit significant anti-trypanocidal activities and indicate that this class of natural product should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe flagellate protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, affects more than 18 million people in Latin America and is responsible for approximately 40000 deaths per year.1 Only two drugs are commercially available for the treatment of this disease, namely, nifurimax (a 2-nitrofuran derivative) and benzindazole (a 2-nitroimidazole acetamide). These drugs are, however, not consistently effective and, moreover, exhibit serious side effects including cardiac and/or renal toxicity.2 There is thus particular interest in the discovery of natural products that might be developed to generate safer and more efficient chemotherapeutic agents against _T. cruzi_.3\n\nA number of biologically-active chromenes have been isolated from species of the genus _Piper_, including the prenylated chromene **1** from _Piper gaudichaudianum_9 and chromenes **2--5** (Fig. 1) from _P. aduncum_.5 Whilst these chromenes have been shown to exhibit anti-fungal4 and anti-tumour properties,5 no evaluation has yet been made with respect to their activity against _T. cruzi_. The object of the present study was to examine a range of natural chromenes and chromene derivatives in order to determine their potential for further development to treat Chagas disease.\n\n## Methods and Results\n\n### General\n\nAll reagents were of analytical grade. For methylation reactions, an entered solution of diazomethane (30 ml) was prepared by dissolving 2.14 g of _N_-methyl-_N_-nitroso-_p_-toluenesulfuphonamide (Diazald; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 10.0 ml of ethanol containing 4.0% potassium hydroxide.6 Hydrogenation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium (3.0 or 10.0%) on activated charcoal (Acros Organics, New Jersey, U.S.A.) as catalyst.7 The acetylated chromene was prepared by treatment with acetic anhydride (20.0 ml) and pyridine (20.0 ml) overnight.8 Benzindazole, employed as positive control in the assays of trypanocidal activity, was obtained from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).\n\n### Plant Material\n\nSpecimens of _P. gaudichaudianum_ and _P. aduncum_ were cultivated from seed under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru) and voucher specimens (with codes Kato 0093 and 0057, respectively) were deposited at the Herbarium of the\n\nFig. 1: Structures of Chromenes Isolated from _Piper gaudichaudianum_ (**1**), _P. aduncum_ (**2—5**) and Chrome Derivatives (**6—12**)\n\n## Page 2\n\nInstitute of Bioscience, USP, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.\n\n**Isolation of Chromenes and Preparation of Derivatives** Compounds **1** and **2--5** (Fig. 1) were isolated from stems of _Piper gaudichaudianum_ and leaves of _P. aduncum_, respectively, according to previously published methods. [4, 5] Various reduced, methylated and acetylated derivatives of chromenes **1** and **3--5** (Fig. 1) were prepared using standard methods, under room temperature.

For the statistical analysis, method of probits was employed.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nAs part of an on-going screening program for new anti-chagasic drugs, the prenylated chromene [(2_S_)-2-methyl-8-(3deg-methylbut-2deg-enyl)]-2-(4deg-methylpent-3deg-enyl)-2_H_-chromene-6-carboxylic acid] (**1**), the major metabolite of the ethanolic extract of _Piper gaudichaudianum_,4 was evaluated with respect to its toxicity against epimastigotes of _T. cruzi_ and exhibited a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 value of 33.8 _m_m. On the basis of this finding, the natural benzopyrans **2--5** (isolated from _P. aduncum_) were assayed for trypanocidal activity together with some novel chromene derivatives obtained from **1**, **3**, **4** and **5** by simple chemical transformations. Specifically, hydrogenation7 of the isoprene units and of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring of **1** produced the derivative **6**. The benzopyran ester **7** was obtained from **1** by methylation with diazomethane,6 and this ester was subsequently reduced to **8** by catalytic hydrogenation. Similarly, derivatives **9** and **10** were obtained from chromenes **3** and **4**, respectively, whilst derivative **11** was obtained by selective hydrogenation of **5**. Finally the chromene **4** was acetylated to **12**.\n\nMost of the isolates together with their derivatives showed significant trypanocidal activities in comparison with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 10.3 _m_m). Compound **7** proved to be the most active with an IC50 value of 2.82 _m_m, _i.e._ almost four times more potent than benznidazole.\n\nAll compounds that showed activity possessed electron-donating substituents. Within this group the prenylated compounds **1**, **5**, **7** and **11** were the most active, whilst the ester derivative **7** (containing two premyl units) was an extremely powerful trypanocidal agent with a potency _ca._ 10-fold greater than that of the corresponding acid. This finding suggests that both premyl and ester substituents are necessary for the strongest anti-parasitic activity. The lower activity exhibited by chromene **2** compared with **3** corroborates the importance of an ester group, and indicates a direct correlation between the electronic nature of the substituents and trypanocidal activity. Moreover, the observed reduction in activity of **12** occasioned by the introduction of an electron-withdrawing acetyl group at C-8 following acetylation8 of **4**, substantiates the influence of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1).\n\nReduction of the double bonds of the premyl substituents (as in derivatives **6** and **8**) gave rise to a significant decrease in toxicity indicating their essential role in trypanocidal activity. Furthermore, reduction of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring (as in derivatives **9** and **10**) resulted in the total loss of toxicity suggesting that a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring is essential for trypanocidal activity. These results suggest that substituents on the aromatic ring that contribute to an increase in lipophilicity are also required for activity (Table 1).\n\nIn conclusion, several natural chromenes from _P. gaudichaudianum_ and _P. aduncum_, along with a series of semi-synthetic derivatives, have been shown to exhibit potential trypanocidal activities against epimastigotes of _T. cruzi_. The results suggest that chromenes should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"compoundName\": \"\\\"(2S)-Methyl-8-isopentyl-2-methyl-2-(4'-methylpentyl)chroman-6-carboxylate\\\"\"}, {\"compoundName\": \"\\\"Methyl-8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-carboxylate\\\"\"}]"}]}

The present study describes the synthesis, the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of a series of 2,3,6-trialkyl-piperidine alkaloids: the natural (-)-3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) and ten semi-synthetic specialine derivatives. Structure-activity relationship (SARs) studies were performed. The structures of all synthesized derivatives were confirmed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance. Compounds were evaluated for their analgesic (acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constrictions, hot-plate test, formalin-in-duced pain test) and some of them for the anti-inflammatory activities (carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test). The pharmacological results showed that several of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 _μ_mU/kg significantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than (-)-spectaline. LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. In the formalin-induced pain only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw lifelong response of the inflammatory phase, (-)-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity. In the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, only (-)-spectaline exhibited an anti-inflammatory profile, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 _μ_mU/kg. Our results suggest different mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio-776 (3-_O_-Bocedaleline), LASSBio-755 (3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline) and (-)-spectaline (LASSBio-754). The antinociceptive profile of some of the semi-synthetic specialine derivatives extends our research concerning the chemical and pharmacological optimization of isolated natural products in the search of new drug candidates from brazilian biodiversity.\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory\n\nAnti-inflammatory\n\n## Page 2\n\nwithing test (ED50=48.5 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg) and capsaicin induced pain (ED50=20.8 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg).[8]\n\nExtending our research program concerning the bio-prospection of natural products and its derivatives, we have selected, to conclude this investigation, another abundant piperidine alkaloid, (-)-3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline (**LASSBio-755**, Chart 1) and synthesized other 10 semi-synthetic derivatives prepared from natural (-)-spectaline, _i.e._ a series of 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloids. The present study was focused on the synthesis, evaluation of antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of these new derivatives in order to verify the stereoelectronic contributions and requirements of the pharmacophoric groups A, B and C for the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities (Chart 1).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe antinociceptive profile of all new 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine derivatives developed herein was initially evaluated using classical acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constriction test,[9] with indomethacin as standard. The results are disclosed in Fig. 1. Some of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg significantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than (-)-spectaline and indomethacin. Among them, the natural acetate derivative (**LASSBio-755**) and its _O_-Boc analogue (**LASSBio-776**) were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. Based on these results some preliminary structure-activity relationships were analysed. Comparing the inhibitory profile of compounds **LASSBio-782**, **LASSBio-821** and **LASSBio-775** with **LASSBio-776** and **LASSBio-755** indicates that the presence of groups that blocked the hydrogen bond donnor character of the piperidine nitrogen seems to be deletery for the analgesic activity. On the other hand, the antinociceptive activity showed to be inversely dependent of the volume of the groups at C-3 (OR1 group) once that the inhibition of the constrictions follows the order R1=H>Ac>Boc. The introduction of more polar and hydrogen bond-donating hydroxy groups at C-13' in the alcohol or oxime derivatives, _i.e._**LASSBio-781**, **LASSBio-820** and **LASSBio-784**, did not result in a increase of the antinociceptive activity but indicated through the direct comparison of the bioprofile of compounds **LASSBio-781** and **LASSBio-820** that the stereochemistry at C-3 seems to be a pharmacophoric requirement for an adequate fit in the target receptor. Additionally, the introduction of an acetyl group at C-3 of **LASSBio-755** modify drastically the toxicological aspect of these alkaloids, once that it did not show any sign of toxicity when administered at a single dose of 500 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg (data not shown) in contrast with (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**).[8]\n\nConsidering the significant antinociceptive activity observed for **LASSBio-755** and its analogue **LASSBio-776** we decided to investigate its effects on other models of pain and compare the results with that showed by (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**).[8] In the formalin-induced pain[10] only **LASSBio-776** was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the inflammatory phase, (-)-spectaline and **LASSBio-755** did show any activity (Fig. 2). Indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the later phase without interfering on the earlier one in the formalin-induced pain test.[11] These results on the formalin-induced pain test led us to investigate the anti-inflammatory profile of these same compounds on the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema.[9]**LASSBio-755** and, unexpectedly, **LASSBio-776** did not show an anti-inflammatory activity at the dose used. Only (-)-spectaline was able to inhibit the edema formation, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg (Fig. 3). The same order of potency was observed for both antinociceptive (ED50=48.5 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg)[9] and anti-inflammatory (ED50=56.6 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg) (Fig. 3) activities of (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**), indicating a common pathway of action.\n\nDespite the absence of effect on the neurogenic phase of the formalin test at the dose used, **LASSBio-755** and **LASSBio-776** showed a significant increase in the latency time in the hot-plate test,[12] similar to morphine, while (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**), even at a dose of 300 \\(\\mu\\)mol/kg, was inactive (Fig. 4).\n\nThe hot-plate and formalin test differs in some aspects. Hot-plate test is based on the use of a short-duration nociceptive thermal stimulus (phasic pain) while formalin use a long-duration chemical stimulus (tonic pain). Tissue injury leads to a persistent afferent input in the latter. The nociceptive response in the first phase of formalin and hot-plate models seems to result from direct activation of nociceptors and is inhibited by drugs which act mainly at central sites.[13, 14] Centrally acting analgesics are also effective in the second phase.[10] This phase is attributed mainly to the development of an inflammatory reaction at the site of injection and increased synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.[13]\n\nFig. 1: Effect of the 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Alkaloids and Indomethacin in Mice Abdominal Constrictions Induced by Acetic Acid (0.6%, i.p.)\n\nFig. 2: Effect of (−)-Specttaline (**LASSBio-754**), **LASSBio-755**, **LASSBio-776** and **Indomethacin** in Mice Formalin-Induced Pain Test\n\nEach column represents the mean−5.E.M. (−10 animals per group). *_p_<0.05 (Student’s / test) as compared to the vehicle control group.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nConsidering the central activity observed for **LASSBio-755** and **LASSBio-776** in the hot-plate test, it was expected to observe some activity in the earlier phase of the formalin that could be dependent of the magnitude of the dose. The first phase of formalin is brief and occurs in the first 5 min. The first measure in the hot-plate test was at 30 min and only **LASSBio-755** showed a significant activity. **LASSBio-776** showed a significant activity from 60 min. Since the compounds were administered orally and the dose used was the same in both tests, the lack of activity on the neurogenic phase could be related with the pharmacokinetics profile of the compounds and somewhat with the mechanisms of the pain processing in these different models.\n\nRecently, searching for new candidates compounds useful for treating Alzheimer's disease, the chloride analogues of some of these semi-synthetic piperidine alkaloid derivatives were described as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.15 The cholinergic system was involved in the transmission of nociceptive information and cholinergic drugs, such as muscarinic and nicotinic agonists, and also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were described to induce antinociception.16-18 The acetylcholine-induced constriction test has been used for screening analgesic compounds.19 In this model (-)-spec-taline and **LASSBio-776** similarly inhibited the constrictions by 44.7% and 47.9%, respectively, while **LASSBio-755** showed a more important antinociceptive effect, inhibiting the constrictions by 82% (Fig. 5). These results in addition with the hot-plate test and the acetylcholinesterase inhibition15 suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the antinociceptive response elicited by **LASSBio-776** and **LASSBio-755**.\n\nTaken together these results suggest differents mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for **LASSBio-776** (3-_O_-Boc-spectaline) and **LASSBio-755** (3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline), acting mainly by modulation of receptors located at central nervous system, and for (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**) that showed to be a peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.\n\nIn conclusion, this study revealed new analgesic compounds derived from (-)-spectaline without apparent toxicity and gave support to the strategy of modifications of isolated natural products from brazilian biodiversity seeking the optimization of the biological activities in the search of new drug candidates.\n\n## Experimental\n\n**Chemistry** The natural alkaloids (-)-spectaline (**LASSBio-754**) and (-)-3-_O_-acetyl-spectaline (**LASSBio-755**) were obtained from the ethanolic extract of flowers of _Cassia spectroballs_ (DC).

Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All the isolated flavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory activity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nm on MPO. Additionally, the radical-scavenging capacity of flavones 1--6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox(r).\n\nflavone; _Pterogyne nitens_; myeloperoxidase; antioxidant; radical scavenging\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Plant Material\n\nLeaves of _Pterogyne nitens_ were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (SP204319). The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nm on MPO. Additionally, the radical-scavenging capacity of flavones 1--6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox(r).\n\n### Isotal and Purification\n\nThe shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of _P nitens_ were ground and defatted with _n_-hexane (1.81x3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by macroactin with ethanol (2.71x3) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH: H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EOAc and _n_-butanol. After solvent removal using a tetraoperator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1--E11). Chromatographic purification of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH: H2O: AcOH (46:53:0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; flow rate 10 ml/ml] led to the isolation of compounds (1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH: H2O: AcOH (55:44:5.5), UV detection at 274 nm; flow rate 13 ml/ml], affording compound **3** (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identification as compound **5** (130 mg). The butanol fraction (1.8g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1--B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4--B6 were combined (333 mg) and purified by RP-HPLC (MeOH: H2O: AcOH (68:31:5.0), UV detection at 274 nm and flow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds **2** (66 mg) and **4** (89 mg).\n\n### Radical Scavenging Activity (BSA)\n\nAntisodium activity of compounds **1**--6 was determined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS+ [2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as-reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1--6 and positive controls at various concentrations (33.3--1.7 _μ_m) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 _μ_m DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 degC for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS+ was prepared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mm) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mm potassium persulphate (ratio: 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12--16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS+ stock solution was diluted with KH2PO/K2HPO4 (100 mm, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buffer solution (ratio: 1:8). ABTS+ solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds **1--6** and positive controls (0.5--7.0 _μ_m/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical\n\n## Page 2\n\nscavenging activity. Anti-radical abilities against ABTS5+ and DPPH7 species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition=[1(-(Asample/A)x100], where A is test absorbance without sample (only solvent after free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with compounds **1**-**6** or positive controls.\n\n**Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity** Inhibitory effects of 7-me-thoxyflavones **1**-**6** on MPO were evaluated through guaiacolidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 ms) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mx).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiued (70 mm) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample concentrations of compounds **1**--**6** (0.50-50 nm) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibition expressed in concentration-response curves.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nNitensoside A (**1**) was obtained as yellow amorphous powder. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (_a_,_b_-unsaturated C=O), 1606, 1502, 1452 (C=C, aromatic), and a broad band at 1160 cm-1, indicating the presence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These results strongly suggested that compound **1** is a flavonoid glycososide.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two amomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at \\(d\\) 4.92 (1H, d, _J_=7.0 Hz, H-1''), \\(d\\) 4.45 (1H, d, _J_=1.5 Hz, H-1''), \\(d\\) 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a''), \\(d\\) 3.70 (1H, dd, _J_=10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b''), and \\(d\\) 1.04 (1H, d, _J_=6.0 Hz, H-6'') suggested the presence of one _b_-glucopyranosyl and one _a_-thamopyranosyl unit in compound **1**, which was confirmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at \\(d\\) 102.4 (C-1''), \\(d\\) 100.6 (C-1''), \\(d\\) 66.6 (C-6'') and \\(d\\) 17.7 (C-6''). In the aromatic moiety of compound **1**, signals at \\(d\\) 7.96 (2H, d, _J_=8.5 Hz, H-2', 6'), 6.94 (2H, d, _J_=8.5 Hz, H-3', 5'), 6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4'-trihydroxyfluoxyne).17,19) The singlet at \\(d\\) 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the flavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR resonance at \\(d\\) 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton signal at \\(d\\) 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at \\(d\\) 158.7 (C-7) and \\(d\\) 3.90, which confirmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at \\(d\\) 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations confirmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4'-trihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolin+H]+ ion at _m/z_ 301 observed in first-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound **1**. A cross-peak between the signals for\n\nFig. 1: Structures of Compounds **1**—**6\n\n## Page 3\n\nC-6 (\\(\\delta\\) 128.1) and the anomeric proton (\\(\\delta\\) 4.92) in the gHMBC spectrum indicated the position of the glucopyranosyl unit at C-6 of the flavone moiety. Assignment of the inner sugar resonances was achieved by using the anomeric proton resonance at \\(\\delta\\) 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of \\({}^{1}\\)H-\\({}^{1}\\)H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (\\(J\\)=7.0 Hz) confirmed the \\(\\beta\\)-linkage of the first glucosyl moiety. The downfield shift of C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) (+5.5 ppm) and upfield shift of C-5\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) (-1.4 ppm) glucopyranosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin-6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside [19], indicated that the rhamnopyranosyl moiety was attached at C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\). Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at \\(\\delta\\) 100.6 (C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 3.70 (H-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) confirmed the C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-\\(O\\)-C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) interglycosidic linkage of compound **1**. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound **1** showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [M\\(-\\)H]\\({}^{-}\\) at 607.1657 \\(m/z\\), in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C\\({}_{23}\\)H\\({}_{31}\\)O\\({}_{15}\\) (607.1657).\n\nCompound **2** was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at \\(m/z\\) 623.1600 (Caled 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C\\({}_{28}\\)H\\({}_{31}\\)O\\({}_{16}\\). The UV and IR spectra of **2** were similar to those of compound **1** suggesting a 6-\\(O\\)-glucosylflavone derivative. The IR of **2** showed a broad hydroxyl band at 3427 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), and an \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), in addition to a C-O stretching band at 1045 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of **2** exhibited absorption maxima typical of a flavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H- and \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR data (Table 1) suggested that compound **2** had the same 7-methoxyflavone skeleton as compound **1**, except for the presence of a hydroxy group at C-3\\({}^{\\prime}\\). In fact, the major difference between compounds **1** and **2** was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at \\(\\delta\\) 7.42 (1H, dd, \\(J\\)=8.5, 2.0 Hz, H-6\\({}^{\\prime}\\)), \\(\\delta\\) 7.50 (1H, d, \\(J\\)=2.0 Hz, H-2\\({}^{\\prime}\\)), and \\(\\delta\\) 6.88 (1H, d, \\(J\\)=8.5 Hz, H-5\\({}^{\\prime}\\)) for compound **2**. The \\({}^{1}\\)C-NMR spectrum of compound **2** presented 28 signals, deduced from distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\), DEPT 135\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, fifteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quaternary carbons, including one \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)-unsaturated ketone at \\(\\delta\\) 182.1, which confirmed the flavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC correlation of signals at \\(\\delta\\) 158.7 (C-7) and \\(\\delta\\) 3.88 (OMe) in addition to NOESY interaction of signals at \\(\\delta\\) 3.88 and \\(\\delta\\) 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at \\(\\delta\\) 128.0 (C-6) and \\(\\delta\\) 4.89 (H-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)), and between signals at \\(\\delta\\) 66.5 (C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) and \\(\\delta\\) 4.43 (H-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)-\\(O\\)-C-1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\) interglycosidic linkage in compound **2**. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures of flavones **1** and **2** were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\alpha\\)-rhamnopyranosyl(1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)6\\({}^{\\prime}\\))-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\alpha\\)-rhamnopyranosyl(1\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)6\\({}^{\\prime\\prime}\\))-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyflavones were isolated and identified as sorbifolin (**3**) [20], sorbifolin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**4**) [20], pedalitin (**5**) [20], and pedalitin 6-\\(O\\)-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**6**) [13].\n\nThe antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay [14, 15]. Pedalitin derivatives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin derivatives, probably due to presence of the _ortho_-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity [21, 22]. Pedalitin derivatives **2**, **5** and **6** showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC\\({}_{50}\\) (_m_M) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC\\({}_{50}\\) values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives **1**, **3** and **4** (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the catheed moiety on the B-ring of flavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin derivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (**5**) when compared to its glucosides **2** and **6** in both assays, evidencing the influence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and therefore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference compound quercetin (IC\\({}_{50}\\) 4.12 _m_M), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones [23]. Similarly, this trend has also been observed for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC\\({}_{50}\\) (5.7 _m_M towards ABTS, and 13.5 _m_M towards DPPH) than its 6-\\(O\\)-glucosyl derivatives **1** and **4**, thus confirming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi-calar activity of 7-methoxyflavones.\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of the effects on mammalian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for flavonoids [24], few studies have been devoted to the MPO inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols [25, 26]. MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modifications [16]. The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds **2**, **5** and **6**, displaying a 3\\({}^{\\prime}\\),\\({}^{\\prime}\\)-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC\\({}_{50}\\) values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 _m_M, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds **1**, **3** and **4**, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides **1**, **2**, **4** and **6** showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between\n\nFig. 2: Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds **1** and **2**\n\n## Page 4\n\nMPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of flavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inflammation derived diseases.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe association of antiradical properties and MPO inhibitory activity observed for flavones **1**--**6**, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated flavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inflammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme involved in inflammatory processes.\n\n## References\n\n- Barnes P., Chung K.

Phys. Chem. Phys.\n\n## Introduction\n\nPilocarpus commonly known as \"Jaborandi\" is a shrub belonging to the Rutaceae and comprises 16 neotropical species spread over tropical and subtropical America. In Brazil, the occurrence of thirteen species [1] has been reported. This genus has long been known as the most important source of the imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine. Imidazole alkaloids are histamine derivatives found only in the genus _Casimiroa_ and _Pilocarpus_[2]. The alkaloid content in some _Pilocarpus_ (0.5 - 1.0%) consists mainly of the imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine, together with small amounts of pilosine and related structures. Pilocarpine salts are valuable in ophthalmic practice and used in eyedrops as miotics and for the treatment of glaucoma [3].\n\nLeaf-cutting ants of the genera _Atta_ and _Acromyr-mex_ are among the most polyphagous agricultural pests of the South American countries. These ants cut vegetables for substrate of their symbiotic food fungus and produce consistent economic damage to the harvesting of the cultivated plants. The agricultural pest control practices generally involve toxic bait applications damaging the environment [4]. An alternative control for these insects can be achieved by inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus through more selective and less toxic natural products than the baits existent in the market.\n\nIn this paper, we report the isolation of 18 compounds, the structural elucidation of a new imidazole alkaloid and the evaluation of their activities as inhibitors of the growth of the symbiotic fungus _Leucoagarcius gongylophorus_ of leaf-cutting ants, _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nIn continuation of our search for compounds to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants [5 - 15], we have investigated the dichloromethane extract of the stems of _P. grandiflora_ leading to the isolation of a new imidazole alkaloid (**1**) in addition to the known compounds germanicol (**2**) [16], b-amiryn (**3**) [17], cocotillone (**4**) [18], b-sitosterol (**5**) [19], stigmast\n\n## Page 2\n\n\\(\\bullet\\)\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n**(13)**[27], 3-(1',1'-dimethylallyl)-scopoletin **(14)**[28], elisin **(15)**[29], dictamine **(16)**[30], 1-methyl-4-methoxy-2-quinolone **(17)**[31] and platydesmine **(18)**[32].\n\nThe known compounds were identified by comparison of their physical and spectral data with those already reported in the literature. The new imidazole alkaloid had its structure determined on the basis of chemical and spectral evidence. The new alkaloid **1** had spectroscopic characteristics of the known imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine. The HREIMS spectrum displayed a molecular ion at \\(m/z\\) 238.0935 in accordance with the molecular formula C11H14O4N2. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals at \\(\\delta=1.01\\) (3H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.4 Hz), \\(\\delta=1.84\\) (1H, \\(m\\)) and \\(\\delta=1.38\\) (1H, \\(m\\)) indicating an ethyl group; two double-doublets at \\(\\delta=4.42\\) (1H, \\(ddd\\), \\(J\\) = 9.0, 5.4 Hz) and \\(\\delta=4.08\\) (1H, \\(dd\\), \\(J\\) = 9.0, 2.0 Hz) for protons of oxygenated carbons at \\(\\delta=71.7\\) and other lactone carbon at \\(\\delta=177.8\\) and the signals at \\(\\delta=2.67\\) (1H, \\(ddd\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0, 7.0, 5.0 Hz), \\(\\delta=4.76\\) (1H, \\(dddd\\), \\(J\\) = 11.5, 7.0, 5.4, 2.0 Hz) indicating a pattern similar to pilocarpine. The \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum for **1** (Table 1) showed eleven carbons in agreement with the imidazole alkaloid structure. The signals at \\(\\delta=177.7\\), 162.4, 152.4, 132.2 and 112.3 suggesting a change in the structure of pilocarpine with two additional carbonyl groups and a double bond. The absence of a signal in the aromatic region and the signal at \\(\\delta=5.23\\) (1H, \\(d\\), 11.0 Hz) in addition to the two carbonyl observed in the \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum suggests a modification of the imidazole ring. This is supported by HMBC spectrum (Table 2), which showed a correlation of the N-methyl group to the carbonyl C-2 and C-9 at \\(\\delta=152.4\\) (\\({}^{3}J\\)) and 162.4 (\\({}^{3}J\\)), and from H-6 to the C-4 and C-5 at \\(\\delta=132.2\\) (\\({}^{3}J\\)) and 162.4 (\\({}^{3}J\\)). In the HSQC spectrum, the carbon at \\(\\delta=35.7\\) was correlated with the signal at \\(\\delta=4.76\\). This value can be explained by anisotropic effects of the carbonyl group and the double bond. The G-NOESY experiments (Table 3) showed correlations of H-6 with the N-3-methyl group and H-8, requiring a _cis_ configuration for the double bond.\n\nThe dichloromethane extract of the stems as well as fractions of _P. grandiflora_s showed strong inhibitory activity on the growth of _L. gongylolphorus_. Among the 18 isolated compounds, the phenolic compounds syringaldehyde **(10)** and vanillic acid **(12)** and the furquinoline alkaloid platydesmine **(18)** exhibited higher inhibition of the fungal growth at 50 \\(\\mu\\)g ml\\({}^{-1}\\).\n\nAntifungal activities have been described for phenolic compounds against _Cladosporium herbarum_[33], _Aspergillus flavus and A. parasticus_[34], _Geotrichum candidum_, _Coridus versicolor_, _Phanerochaete chrysosporium_ and _Mycelia sterilia_[35].\n\nGrayer and Harbone [36] suggested that fluoroquinoline alkaloids might also play a role in the defense of plants against potentially pathogenic fungi.

Naturforsch. **63c**, 371-382 (2008); received June 18/December 7, 2007Hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, and 34 isolated compounds from _Vitex polygama_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg (Myrtaceae) were screened for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ and _T. brucei_, as well as for their enzymatic inhibitory activities on glycosomal glycerolaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and trypanothione reductase (TR) enzymes from _T. cruzi_ and adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) enzyme from _Leishmania tarentolae_. In general, polar extracts displayed strong effects and some of the tested compounds have shown good results in comparison to positive controls of the bioassays.\n\nMyrtaceae, _Trypanosoma_, _Leishmania_\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg commonly known as Uvatinga belongs to the family Myrtaceae and occurs in grasslands (\"campos rupestres\"), deciduous forests (\"cerradoes\") and gallery forests in Goias, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo States of Brazil. This plant takes part in a genus comprising only nine species; two of them are vulnerable to extinction in Sao Paulo State (Programa Biota FAPESP, 2007) and one species, _S. delicata_, has been recently described (Sobral and Proenca, 2006). _S. densiflora_ has been biologically and chemically researched by our group (Gallo _et al._, 2006a, b, c) since neither data about it could be found in the literature nor popular use has been registered.\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and is commonly called \"Taruma\". Its leaf tea is used in folk medicine to treat kidney infections (Rodrigues, 2001; Gallo _et al._, 2008). Several of its compounds had already been characterized and bioassayed (Leitao _et al._, 1997; Leitao and Delle Monache, 1998; Santos _et al._, 2001; Mensor _et al._, 2001), but none was regarded as neither potential trypanocidal nor enzyme inhibitor.\n\nTrypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a complicated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoan agents.\n\nTrypanosomatids have no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and their bloodstream forms are highly dependent on glycolysis to the stage of pyruvate as sole energy supply. Trypanosome glycoly\n\n## Page 2\n\nsis occurs in a specific microbody called glycosome. Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy necessary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD\\({}^{+}\\) and inorganic phosphate. The _in silico_ modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker _et al._, 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spectridine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb _et al._, 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the \\(N^{1}\\),\\(N^{8}\\)-(bisglutathionyl)-spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S]2) to dihydrotrypanothione (T[SH]2). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S]2) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against trypanosomatids (Hamilton _et al._, 2003).\n\nThe genus _Leishmanita_ owns three enzymes involved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and _a_-D-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into adenosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofuranose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid sequence when compared to corresponding mammalian enzymes, which should allow the development of selective inhibitor compounds.\n\nIn our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ and _T. brucei_. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from _T. cruzi_ or APRT enzyme from _Leishmanita tarentolae_, were assessed.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae) and _Siphoneugena densiflora_ O. Berg (Mytraceae) were collected in July 2000 in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), _i. e._, the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentrations, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC50 = 55.5 _m_M).\n\n### _L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activity_\n\nAPRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier described procedures (Thiemann _et al._, 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectrophotometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 _m_L APRT solution. The reaction started by the addition of enzyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira _et al._, 2001).\n\n### _T. cruzi TR inhibitory activity_\n\nEnzyme activity and assay were performed according to prior descriptions (Hamilton _et al._, 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as positive control [IC50 = 2.72 _m_m (personal communication, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC50 value was determined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Imperial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC50 values, and the results were fitted into the equation\n\n\\[\\text{Y} = \\left\\{ {\\text{Range}/\\left[ {1 + (\\text{X}/\\text{IC}_{50})^{\\text{s}}} \\right]} \\right\\} + \\text{Background},\\]\n\nwhere Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in _m_m), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1).\n\n### _T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assay_\n\nBloodstream forms of _T. brucei_, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% serum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of _T. brucei_ was evaluated using the Alamar Blue(r) assay (Raz _et al._, 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 _m_m.\n\n### _T. cruzi cytotoxicity assay_\n\nThe assay was carried out using blood infected with trypanastigotes of _T. cruzi_ \"Y\" strain collected by cardiac puncture in experimentally infected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal murine blood to 2 * 106 trypanastigotes/mL. The assay was performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or compounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 _m_g/mL, 250 _m_g/mL and 100 _m_g/mL. The plates were incubated at 4 degC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC50 = 31 _m_g/mL or 76 _m_M) were run in parallel. The results were expressed as percentage of lysis of trypanastigote forms compared to the DMSO control. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n### _Identification of compounds_\n\nFig. 2 shows the structures of isolated and tested compounds from _S. densiflora_: quercetin **(1)**; quercetin **(2)**; gallic acid **(3)**; aryanbolic acid **(4)**; vanillic acid **(5)**; sitosterol **(6)**; syringic acid **(7)**; 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzoic acid **(8)**; ellagic acid **(9)**; 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde **(10)**; casuarin **(11)**; castalagin **(12)**; ellagic acid 4-_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranoside **(13)**; and from _V. polygamma_: lucolin **(14)**; 3-O-methylquercetin **(15)**; chrysorioenol **(16)**; 3,3'-_O_-dimethylquercetin **(17)**; 3,7,4'-_O_-trimethylkaempferol **(18)**; acacetin **(19)**; isoorientin **(20)**; schaftoside **(21)**; carlinoside **(22)**; penduletin 4'-_O_-methyl ether **(23)**; 2\\(a\\),3_a_-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid **(24)**; oleanolic acid **(25)**; 2\\(a\\),3\\(a\\),19_a_-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid **(26, euscaphic acid); _p_-hydroxybenzoic acid **(27)**; 20-hydroxyec\n\n## Page 6\n\ndysone (**28**, polypodine A); polypodine B (**29**); stachysterone (**30**); shidsterone (**31**); metacrylic acid (**32**); caffeoyl 6-_O_-b_-d-glucopyranoside (**33**); sitosterol 3-_O_-b_-d-glucopyranoside (**34**, daucosterol). The structures of the compounds were elucidated by comparison of their spectral data (1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, HMBC, HSQC, 1H-1H COSY, IE-MS or ESI-MS) with earlier published data (see references in Tables I and II).\n\n### Trypanocidal activity\n\nAmong the 21 extracts and 13 partition fractions tested against trypomastigote forms of _T. cruzi_, 15 revealed significant activities (> 60%, Table III) and were considered as promising sources of active substances.\n\nPartition of VP-HL produced fractions with poorer activities (Table III). 1H NMR analysis of\n\nFig. 2: Structures of compounds isolated from _V. polygamma_ and _S. densiflora._\n\n## Page 7\n\nFig. 2 (continued).\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\nVP-HHL (53%) showed characteristic signals of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. VP-DHL (38%), when submitted to column chromatography, yielded a fraction containing a mixture of steroids which was responsible for 93% of Tc lysis at 500 _m_g/mL (this information is not displayed in the table). VP-EHL (36%) yielded compound **18** (31%), and VP-MHL (52%) afforded compounds **18** and **23** (16%).\n\nVP-DML, after fractionation, afforded compounds **16**, **17**, and a mixture of flavonoids containing quercetin 3-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside and quercetin 4'-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside, which caused 97% Tc lysis at 500 _m_g/L.

The flavone luteolin (**14**), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduction of the methoxy group at position C-3 (**15**) or C-3' (**16**), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested enzymes (for comparison, see activities of compounds **17**, **18** and **23** in Table II). The _O_-glycosylated flavonoid quercetin (**2**) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone **1**. Lio _et al._ (1985) observed the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activities also performed by compounds **21** and **22** (Table II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I and II). An unseparated mixture of lupool, _a_-amyrin and _b_-amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from _S. densiflora_ (SD-DML), tested at 200 _m_m, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentration, a mixture of compound **24** and its isomer _2a_,3_b_-dihydroxy-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound **24** inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II).\n\n### APRT inhibition\n\nFrom 17 extracts and subfractions tested, eight presented results greater than 60%. Several could not be screened because they absorbed at the same wavelength used in the bioassay. The activity of the methanolic extract from leaves of _S. densiflora_ was increased after fractionation (from 74 to 90%, Table I). Furthermore, quercetin (**1**) as well as quercetin (**2**), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD-EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had activities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I and II). When analyzing the results displayed by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hydroxy groups. Accordingly, compound **29**, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to **28** and two in relation to **30**, was twice more active than **28** and seven times more than **30** (Table II).\n\n### TR inhibition\n\nAll tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (**11**) and castalagin (**12**) which performed an IC50 value of 179.3 _m_m on enzyme inhibition, although this result is not promising in comparison with clomipramine, the positive control.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. Marcos Sobral (UFMG) and Fatima Regina Salimena-Pires (UFJF) for botanical identifications, to ALCOA Aluminio S/A for facilitating the plant collections, to Ahilan Saravanamuthu for supplying TR enzyme, and to Dr. John Lee Richardson for valuable discussions.

The acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn from a culture of _Penicillium_ sp.1 afforded orcinol (**1**). On the other hand, _Penicillium_ sp.1 cultivated in potato-dextrose-broth furnished two different compounds, _cyclo_-(L-Pro-L-Val) (**2**) and uracil (**3**). The chromatographic fractionation of the acetonitrile fraction obtained from _Penicillium_ sp.2 led to three dihydroisocoumarins, 4-hydroxymellein (**4**), 8-methoxyamellein (**5**) and 5-hydroxyamellein (**6**). Compounds **5** and **6** were obtained from the _Penicillium_ genus for the first time. Additionally, metabolites **1-6** were evaluated for their antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. The most active compounds **1** and **4** exhibited detection limits of 5.00 and 10.0 _m_g against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospremum_, respectively. Compound **2** showed a detection limit of 10.0 _m_g, displaying potent AChE inhibitory activity.\n\nkeywords: _Penicillium_, _Alibertia macrophylla_, Endophytic Fungi, Acetylcholinesterase\n\n## Introduction\n\nTerrestrial-derived microfungi have been the sources of several novel and pharmacologically active compounds over decades (Hormazabal _et al._, 2005; Schmeda-Hirschmann _et al._, 2008; Takahashi and Lucas, 2008). In this context, endophytes belonging to the _Penicillium_ genus have been recognized as a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites (Fill _et al._, 2007). Recent examples include the anticancer berkelic acid from _Penicillium_ sp., polyketides with HIV-integrase inhibitory activity from _P. chrysogenum_ and the insecticidal paraheraquamides H and I from _P. cluniae_ (Singh, 2003; Stierle _et al._, 2006).\n\nAs part of our interest for bioactive metabolites from endophytes associated with Brazilian plants (Cafeu _et al._, 2005; Inacio _et al._, 2006; Silva _et al._, 2006; Teles _et al._, 2006), _Alibertia macrophylla_ (Rubiaceae) was selected for our study, due to the fact that this species accumulates a series of bioactive compounds (Bolzani _et al._, 1991; Silva _et al._, 2007).\n\nThus, the major aim of the current study was to identify potential bioactive compounds from _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2, two endophytes associated with _A. macrophylla_ leaves, by using antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory assays.\n\n## Material and Methods\n\n### General\n\n1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), _g_HMBC, _g_HMQC and _g_COSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the solvents as internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer in the ESI mode using MeOH/H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V). TLC was \n\n## Page 2\n\nperformed using Merck silica gel 60 (230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 \\(\\text{PF}_{25}\\) plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde(\\(\\text{H}_{5}\\text{SO}_{4}\\) reagent followed by heating at 120 degC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 preparative column (250 mm x 21.2 mm). Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 instrument using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck).\n\n### Plant material\n\nAuthenticated _Alibertia macrophyla_ K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) was collected in Estacao Ecologica Experimental de Mogi-Guava, Fazenda Campinina, Mogi-Guava, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identification was made by Ph.D. Maria Claudia Marx Young (Institute of Botany, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil (voucher no. SP 370915).\n\n### Isolation and identification of the endophytes\n\nFor isolation of the endophytic fungi, adult and healthy leaves of _A. macrophyla_ were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were first washed with water and soap, and then immersed in an 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and finally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. Sterilized leaves were cut into 2 x 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthramicine sulfate (50 mg/mL) with approx. 3 to 4 pieces on each dish (Silva _et al._, 2006).\n\nThe endophytic fungi were identified according to the characteristics of morphology of the culture and spores, mechanism of spore production, and molecular taxonomy according to a modification of the rapid preparation of DNA from filamentous fungi (Raeder and Broda, 1985). The fungi were identified by Ph.D. Derlene Attil de Angelis (CPOBA-UNICAMP - Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quimicas, Biologicas e Agricolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in our collection with culture numbers 05070032-C and 05-070032-A for _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2, respectively.\n\n### Preparation of the crude extract in corn and potato-dextrose-broth of Penicillium sp.1\n\nThe cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 degC for 40 min. After cool, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC in static mode for 21 d. After the incubation period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 x 250 mL); after that the solvent was evaporated, providing the crude MeOH extract (10.6 g). The methanol extract was dissolved in water and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was suspended in acetonitrile and partitioned with hexane. Evaporation of the organic phase resulted in the crude acetonitrile extract (804 mg).\n\nThe fungus was cultivated using potato-dextrose-broth (PDB) as culture medium (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/L H2O). For the PDB, 20 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) were used, each containing 100 mg of potato extract, 5.0 g dextrose and 250 mL distilled water, which were autoclaved at 125 degC for 15 min. Approx. 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of _Penicillium_ sp.1 were inoculated into each flask, and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 d at 25 degC on rotatory shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration, and the filtrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 x 2.5 L). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase under reduced pressure yielded a brown, solid residue (507 mg).\n\n### Preparation of the crude extract in corn of Penicillium sp.2\n\nThe cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 degC for 40 min. After cooling, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 degC in static mode for 21 d. After the incubation period, the solid cultures were \n\n## Page 3\n\nground and extracted with EtOAc (6 x 250 mL); after that the solvent was evaporated, providing the crude EtOAc extract (15.0 g). The EtOAc extract was dissolved in acetonitrile and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with hexane. The acetonitrile fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude acetonitrile extract (6.0 g).\n\n### Isolation and identification of compounds **1**-**6_\n\nThe crude acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn of _Penicillium_ sp.1 (804 mg) was fractionated by CC using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/acetonitrile gradient (10-100% acetonitrile) affording 10 fractions (A-J). Fraction D (13.1 mg) afforded compound **1**. The crude EtOAc extract obtained in PDB of _Penicillium_ sp.1 (507 mg) was fractionated by CC using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/acetonitrile gradient (10-100% acetonitrile) affording 5 fractions (K-O). Fraction C (30.5 mg), after recrystallization with MeOH, led to compound **2** (4.5 mg). Fraction L (40.2 mg) was further purified using RP-HPLC [_l_ = 254 nm, 12.0 mL/min, H2O/acetonitrile (9:1, 40 min)] and supplied compound **3** (12.4 mg, _R_t = 3 min).\n\nThe crude acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn of _Penicillium_ sp.2 (6.0 g) was fractionated by CC using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/MeOH gradient (5-100% MeOH) affording 16 fractions (Fr1-Fr16). Fraction Fr2 (18.0 mg) was further purified using RP-HPLC [_l_ = 254 nm, 10.0 mL/min, H2O/acetonitrile (82., 80 min)] leading to compounds **4** (3.4 mg, _R_t = 24.5 min), **5** (5.3 mg, _R_t = 31.1 min) and **6** (6.3 mg, _R_t = 62.3 min).\n\n_Orcinol_ (**1**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 8.97 (2H, _brs_, 1-OH and 5-OH), 6.01 (2H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-2 and H-4), 5.99 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-6), 2.43 (3H, \\(s\\), H-7). - 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 158.1 (C-1, C-5), 138.9 (C-3), 106.9 (C-2, C-4), 99.7 (C-6), 21.1 (C-7).\n\n_Cyclo_(_L_-_Pro_-_L_-_Val_) (**2**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 7.92 (1H, _brs_, H-8), 4.12 (1H, \\(t\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-6), 3.92 (1H, _brs_, H-9), 3.40 (2H, \\(m\\), H-3), 2.35 (1H, _dsept_, \\(J\\) = 2.5, 6.5 Hz, H-10), 2.13 (2H, \\(m\\), H-5), 1.78 (2H, \\(m\\), H-4), 1.02 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, H-12), 0.86 (3H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, H-11). - 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 170.2 (C-7), 165.2 (C-1), 59.5 (C-9), 58.2 (C-6), 44.6 (C-3), 27.7 (C-5, C-10), 22.0 (C-4), 16.4 (C-11), 18.3 (C-12).\n\n_Uracil_ (**3**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 7.38 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-6), 5.41 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-5). - 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 164.4 (C-4), 151.9 (C-2), 142.9 (C-6), 99.9 (C-5).\n\n_4-Hydroxymellein_ (**4**): 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-_d_o): \\(d\\) = 11.0 (1H, _brs_, 8-OH), 7.45 (1H, _dd_, \\(J\\) = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, H-6), 6.96 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-7), 6.86 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, H-5), 4.63 (1H, _dq_, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 2.0 Hz, H-3), 4.50 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, H-4), 1.90 (1H, _br_ = 4OH), 1.51 (3H, \\(d\\),\n\n## Page 4\n\ned to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 degC. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol), in order to wash them, and were thoroughly dried just before use. After migration of the sample in a suitable solvent (or direct deposition of sample), the TLC plate was dried for complete removal of the solvent. The plate was then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and thoroughly dried again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was laid flat on plastic plugs in a plastic tank containing a little bit of water; by this means, water did not come directly into contact with the plate but the atmosphere was kept humid. The cover was placed on the tank and incubation was performed at 37 degC for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the 1-naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple colouration after 1-2 min. Galanthamine was employed as positive control (Marston _et al._, 2002).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe molecular structures of all isolates (Fig. 1) were confirmed by the MS and NMR data as shown below. Assignments were based on 2D-NMR experiments including _g_COSY, _g_HMQC, and _g_HMBC.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a brown amorphous powder and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C7H5O2 ([M-H]- at _m/z_ 123). The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** showed two aromatic signals, d_H 5.99 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-6) and d_H 6.01 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, 2H, H-2 and H-4) suggesting a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135deg spectra showed five signals, assigned to one oxygenated aromatic groups at d_C 158.1 (C-1 and C-5), two methines attributed to signals at d_C 99.7 (C-6) and d_C 106.9 (C-2 and C-4) and one methyl group at d_C 21.1 (C-7). The position of the methyl substituent at position C-3 was attributed on the basis on the _g_HMBC experiment, which indicates a correlation of d_H 2.43 (H-7) with d_C 138.9 (C-3) and d_C 106.9 (C-2 and C-4). This data suggests that **1** is orcinol (Monde, 1998).\n\nCompound **2** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H18N2O2 ([M+H]+ at _m/z_ 197). The 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed signals at d_H 0.86 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-11), d_H 1.02 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12), d_H 4.12 (_t_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-6), and d_H 3.92 (_brs_, 1H, H-9). Also, three multiplets at d_H 3.40 (2H, H-3), 1.78 (2H, H-4), and 2.13 (2H, H-5) were observed. Analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum indicated two methyl groups, three methylene carbon atoms and three methine carbon atoms. The signals at d_C 170.2 and d_C 165.2 were attributed to two amide carbonyl groups at C-7 and C-1, respectively, and 1H NMR signals of an amino acid suggested that **2** belongs to the diketopiperazine class. The _g_HMBC cross-peaks between the signal for C-1 and the signals for H-3, H-6, H-9, and H-10, as well as the signal for C-7 and the signals for H-5, H-6, and H-9 confirmed that **2** was biosynthesized by condensation of the amino acids proline and valine. The interpretation of these results combined with comparison with literature data (Furtado _et al._, 2005) suggest that diketopiperazine **2** is _cyclo_-(L-Pro-L-Val).\n\nCompound **3** was isolated as yellow amorphous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C4H4N2O2 ([M-H]- at _m/z_ 111). The 1H NMR spectrum of **3** appeared to be relatively simple, exhibiting two doublets at d_H 5.41 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-5) and d_H 7.38 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-6). The 13C NMR spectrum showed only four signals, for two carbonyl groups [d_C 151.9 (C-2) and d_C 164.4 (C-4)] and two methines [d_C 99.9 (C-5) and d_C 142.9 (C-6)]. These data indicate that **3** is uracil (Schindler, 1998; Martin _et al._, 2007).\n\nFig. 1: Chemical structures of compounds **1–6** isolated from _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nCompound **4** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M+Na]+ at _m/z_ 217). The 1H NMR spectrum showed doublets for three aromatic protons at _d_H 6.86 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-5), _d_H 6.96 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-7) and _d_H 7.45 (_dd_, \\(J\\) = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, 1H, H-6). Altogether these signals suggest that **4** presented a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The _g_COSY cross-peaks of the doublet at _d_H 1.51 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-9) coupled to a methine hydrogen atom with a signal at _d_H 4.63 (_dq_, \\(J\\) = 6.5, 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-3) in turn coupled to a methine hydrogen atom at _d_H 4.50 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-4), suggesting an _a_-methylhydroxy unit in the molecular structure of **4**. The broad singlet at _d_H 11.0 (1H) indicated the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a hydroxy group (8-OH) and a carbonyl group (C-1). The 13C NMR and DEPT 135deg spectra showed the presence of ten signals, assigned to one methyl [_d_C 16.0 (C-9)], five methine groups [_d_C 78.1 (C-3), _d_C 67.2 (C-4), _d_C 118.5 (C-5), _d_C 136.7 (C-6), _d_C 118.2 (C-7)], and three aromatic quaternary carbon atoms [_d_C 162.1 (C-8), _d_C 106.8 (C-8a), _d_C 140.5 (C-4a)], and one signal at _d_C 169.1 (C-1), which was attributed to a carbonyl group, suggesting that **4** is an dihydro-isocumarin. This information coupled to data of the literature (Holler _et al._, 1999) assigne **4** to the structure of 4-hydroxymellein.\n\nCompound **5** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C11H12O3 ([M+H]+ at _m/z_ 193). In particular, a high similarity between the NMR spectral data of compounds **5** and **4** was observed. The major difference was identified in the chemical shifts attributed to H-4 of **5**, which showed a multiplet at _d_H 2.80 (2H, H-4). Furthermore, the presence of a singlet at _d_H 3.88 (3H, H-10) suggested a methoxy substituent. A _g_HMBC correlation was observed between the signal at _d_C 161.2 (C-8) and H-10, which confirmed the position of the methoxy group at C-8. This information coupled to literature data (Kamisuki, 2007) assigne **5** to the structure of 8-methoxymellein.\n\nThe dihydroisocumarin **6** was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M-H]+ at _m/z_ 193). Considering differences in the NMR spectral data between compounds **5** and **6**, the 1H NMR spectrum of **6** exhibited two ortho-coupled hydrogen atoms at _d_H 6.73 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-7) and _d_H 6.92 (_d_, \\(J\\) = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-6), suggesting a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135deg data indicated signals at _d_C 156.5 and _d_C 143.0, which where attributed to the hydroxylated aromatic carbon atoms C-8 and C-5, respectively. These data indicate a hydroquinone ring in the molecular structure of **6**, which was identified as 5-hydroxymellein (Harwood, 1984).\n\nCompounds **1**-**6** were evaluated for their antifungal activity against _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_ using a direct bioautography assay (Table I). The most active compounds, orcinol (**1**) and 4-hydroxymellein (**4**), showed a potent effect towards the yeasts, exhibiting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 _m_g against _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_, respectively. **5** exhibited moderate fungitoxicity towards _C. cladosporioides_ and _C. sphaerospermum_, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 _m_g, re\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Compound & Antifungal activitya & Acetylcholinesterase \\\\  & _Cladosporium_ & _Cladosporium_ & inhibitory activitya \\\\  & _cladosporioides_ & _sphaerospermum_ & \\\\\n**1** & 5.00 & 10.0 & 60.0 \\\\\n**2** & 50.0 & 50.0 & 10.0 \\\\\n**3** & 25.0 & 25.0 & 60.0 \\\\\n**4** & 5.00 & 10.0 & 30.0 \\\\\n**5** & 10.0 & 25.0 & \\textgreater{}100 \\\\\n**6** & 50.0 & 50.0 & \\textgreater{}100 \\\\ Nystatinb & 1.00 & 1.00 & – \\\\ Galanthaminec & – & – & 1.00 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable I: Antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of compounds **1**–**6**.\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nspectively. 5-Hydroxymellein (6) proved to be not potent, since the content at which this compound showed activity was 50 _m_g. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydroisocumarins and free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8. The identification of the compounds **1**, **4** and **5**, potentially bioactive against the phytopathogenic fungi, indicates that they act as defence of the host species against possible attacks of pathogens.\n\nAlthough a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for compounds isolated from _Penicillium_, few studies have been devoted to the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to terminate the impulse-transmitted action through cholinergic synapses (Stryer, 1995; Sigurdsson and Gudbjarnason, 2007). Although the fundamental reason of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not clear so far, AD is firmly associated with impairment in the cholinergic transmission. A number of AChE inhibitors have been considered as candidates for the symptomatic treatment of AD as the most useful relieving strategy (Barbosa-Filho _et al._, 2006; Alarcon _et al._, 2008). The diketopiperazine 2 exhibited the highest AChE inhibitory activity displaying a detection limit of 10.0 _m_g (Table I). Compounds **1** and **3** showed a detection limit of 60 _m_g, which was considered as weakly potent. The dihydrosiocoumarin **4** displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 30.0 _m_g. On the other hand, compounds **5** and **6** were not active (detection limits over 100 _m_g). Similar to the observed antifungal activity, free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8 corroborate to increase the anti-AChE potency presented by dihydrosiocoumarins.\n\nIn conclusion, six metabolites from _Penicillium_ sp.1 and _Penicillium_ sp.2, two endophytes associated with _A. macrophylla_ leaves, exhibited potential bioactivity, including antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results suggest that compounds **2** and **4** should be considered further in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for the use in the drug design for Alzheimer's disease treatment.\n\n###### Acknowledgements.\n\n This work was funded by grants of the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) as part of Biota-FAPESP,The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br), grant no. 03/02176-7, awarded to V.

The highest insecticidal activity was obtained for \\(\\beta\\)-photogedunin.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the last decades considerable efforts have been devoted to the discovery of new sources of botanical insecticides and antifeedants. Among the plant families studied, Meliaceae and Rutenceae are perhaps the most promising (Schoonhoven, 1982), at least partly due to the presence of limonoids and triterpenoids characteristic of the Rutales order. The biological activity of limonoids from Rutales has been reviewed (Champagne _et al._, 1992). Some neem-based botanical insecticides have already been developed and marketed (Schmutterer, 1990, 1995, 2005).\n\n_Carapa guianensis_ Aublet, also called andiroba, andiroba-saruva, iandirova, carapa, and nanofiba (Lorenzi and Matos, 2002), is a tall Meliaceae tree growing wild throughout South America, West India, and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in flooded areas of the Amazon rainforest (Ambrozin _et al._, 2006). From the nuts of this plant an oil, called andiroba oil, is extracted, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and as an anticancer remedy (Bickii _et al._, 2000; Gilbert _et al._, 1999; MacKinnon _et al._, 1997; Moura _et al._, 2002). Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, together with 2\\(-\\)5% of unsaponifiable material. In addition, from several parts of _Carapa guianensis_ limonoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, flavonoids, and diglycerides have been isolated (Lavie _et al._, 1973; Marcelle and Moto, 1975; Ollis _et al._, 1964, 1970; Qi _et al._, 2003, 2004).\n\n_Cabralea canjerana_ (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae) (\"canjarana\") is a native tree of economic importance in Brazil. It is a dioecious tree with wide-spread distribution in the neotropics, extending from Costa Rica to southern Brazil and northern Argentina. According to Pennington _et al._ (1981), it inhabits mainly nonflooded evergreen lowland or lower hill rain forests.\n\nIn the present paper, triterpenoids and limonoids isolated from _C. canjerana_ and _C. guianensis_ were examined for their effects on the fall armworm, _Spodoptera frugiperda_ (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Notutiade). _S. frugiperda_ is a major pest of many crops in the Americas and one of the most important pests of tropical maize, causing up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity of this crop in Brazil (Cruz _et al._, 1996).\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## Material and Methods\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Cabralea canjerana_ was collected at the Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil, and identified by T. D. Pennington from the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, UK. A voucher (1842; 1983) is deposited in the herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestal Dendrologia, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.\n\nThe arillus of the _Carapa guianensis_ seeds were supplied by Cognis Brasil Ltda., Av. Nacoes Unidas 10989, 4deg andar, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\n\n### Compounds isolation\n\nFruits (460 g) and seeds (200 g) from _C. canjerana_ were extracted with ethanol, at room temperature for three times. The ethanolic extract (88.3 g) of the fruits was submitted to liquid-liquid partition with 120 ml methanol/water (3:1, v/v) solution. This solution was partitioned with different solvents to give fractions in _n_-hexane (fr-Hex, 47.4 g), dichloromethane (fr-CH2Cl2, 5.4 g), ethyl acetate (fr-EtOAc, 4.4 g), and methanol (fr-MeOH, 11.9 g). The fraction fr-Hex (2.8 g) was submitted to a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 45 fractions of 50 ml) using _n_-hexane/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase, yielding nine fractions (fr-Hex.1 to fr-Hex.10) after TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2 (102 mg) was re-chromatographed by column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20 as stationary phase (column 3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., 26 fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol/dichloromethane, 1:1, v/v), yielding three fractions (fr-Hex.2.1 to fr-Hex.2.3) after comparison by TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2.2 (88.6 mg) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 3.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 10 fractions of 5 ml each) eluted with _n_-hexane/acetone (9:1, v/v) to afford octilolone (**1**, 16.3 mg) and carbaleadiol (**2**, 24.4 mg).\n\nThe ethanolic extract (14.3 g) of the seeds of _C. canjerana_ was chromatographed on microcrystalline cellulose-D and silica gel (column 5.0 x 22.0 cm i.d., fractions of 250 ml each) using _n_-hexane (250 ml) followed by dichloromethane (1 l), acetone (1 l), and methanol (1 l) as mobile phases yielding 13 fractions (EES-1 to EES-13). The fraction EES-2 (1.72 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 - 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 69 fractions of 10 ml each) using _n_-hexane/acetone/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase to yield eleven fractions (EES-2.1 to EES-2.11) which were joined based on TLC. The fraction EES-2.6 (293.4 mg) was rechromatographed by column chromatography using a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol), yielding fifteen fractions (EES-2.6.1 to EES-2.6.15). The fraction EES-2.6.7 afforded methyl anglopensate (**3**, 48.2 mg). The fraction EES-2.7 (230.6 mg) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 35 fractions of 10 ml each), using _n_-hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as mobile isocratic phase, yielding seventeen fractions (EES-2.7.1 to EES-2.7.17). The fraction EES-2.7.9 afforded 3-_b_-deacetylfissinolide (**4**, 63.7 mg).\n\nThe arillus ethanolic extract (10.0 g) of _C. guianensis_ was submitted to vacuum chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase (70-230 mesh, column 30 x 5 cm i.d.) and _n_-hexane followed by CH2Cl2, EtOHAc, and MeOH (1 l each) as mobile phases, yielding four fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (3.8 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 30 x 4 cm i.d., _n_-hexane and acetone gradient as eluent, starting with pure _n_-hexane and finishing with pure acetone, 32 fractions of 200 ml each) to give five fractions (Ac1 to Ac5). The fraction Ac3 (3.0 g) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 10 x 3 cm i.d.) eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2 to MeOH, 28 fractions of 50 ml each) to yield ten fractions (Ac3.1 to Ac3.10). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**, 24.4 mg) and _b_-photogedunin (**6**, 14.4 mg) were isolated from fraction Ac3.2 by recycling HPLC (Asahipack polymeric column; eluent, methanol/dichloromethane, 7:3, v/v; flow, 4 ml min-1).\n\n### Biological activity\n\nLarvae of _Spodoptera frugiperda_ (J. E. Smith) were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Laboratory of Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil, and reared on semi-artificial diets (Kasten _et al._, 1978; Parra, 1986). They were maintained in an incubation chamber with a photoperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark, (70 +- 5)% relative humidity, and (25 +- 1) degC.\n\nFor each treatment and control, 30 neonate larvae of _S. frugiperda_ were used. A solution of compound was added to ascorbic acid (1.56 g; an\n\n## Page 3\n\ningredient of the diet). After evaporation of the solvent, the mixture was incorporated into the semi-artificial diet in which bean and wheat germ are the basic ingredients (Kasten _et al._, 1978) at final contents of 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg kg-1 for 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**), and 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg-1 for coctillone (**1**), cabraleadiol (**2**), methyl angolensate (**3**), 3-_b_-deacetylfissinolide (**4**), and _b_-photogedunin (**6**). The diet for the control was prepared similarly but without the triterpenoids or limonoids. Gedunin (**7**) was used as positive control. The diets were placed in previously sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm x 2.5 cm), into which larvae of _S. frugiperda_ were introduced individually. The pupae were weighed 1 d after pupation and were transferred to plastics cups, where they stayed until the emergence of adults. Daily observations were made and the following parameters were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal phases, (2) weight of pupae, and (3) percentage of dead insects (mortality) at the end of each phase.\n\n### Statistics\n\nData were submitted to an analysis of variance ANOVA (Zar, 1974), and the averages were compared applying the Tukey test (_P_ <= 0.05). Each tube containing one insect, independent of the developed phase, was considered as one replicate, therefore, the number of replicates was different for each treatment. For evaluation of the mortality of the larvae and pupae, the experimental unit was constituted by the mean of five tubes containing one larva each, with six replications by treatment.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe triterpenoids **1** and **2** and limonoids **3** and **4** were isolated from the fruits and seeds of _C. canjerana_ and the limonoids **5** and **6** from the arilulus of _C. guianensis_ (Fig. 1). Their structures were confirmed by 1H and 15C NMR spectroscopy and comparison with data from the literature (Braga _et al._, 2006; Ambrozin _et al._, 2006).\n\nCompounds **1**-**6** were incorporated in the semi-artificial diet. **2**, **4**, and **5** affected larval development (Table 1), and only **6** affected pupal development at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg [(8.5 +- 1.64) days and (8.9 +- 1.25) days, respectively, control (10.1 +- 1.45) days]. Larvae fed with\n\nFig. 1: The triterpenoids coctillone (**1**) and cabraleadiol (**2**), and the limonoids methyl angolensate (**3**), 3-_β_-deacetylfissinolide (**4**), 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**5**), and _β_-photogedunin (**6**) isolated from _Carapa guianensis_ and _Cabralea canjerana_, and of gedunin (**7**).\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nsemi-artificial diet treated with **5** and **6** showed significant reduction in the pupal weight (17.8 and 31.5 mg at 50 mg kg-1, respectively), comparable to the effect of gedunin (**7**, 27.2 mg, Table I). Larvae fed with semi-artificial diet treated with **2**, **4**, and **5** at 50.0 mg kg-1 prolonged the larval time for approximately 1.2 days similar to gedunin, suggesting that these compounds act as larval growth inhibitors (Table I).\n\nCompounds **2** and **4** prolonged the larval phase, although no alteration in pupal weight was observed. Tanzubil and McCaffery (1990) observed that larvae treated with low doses of azadirachtin produced pupae with a weight comparable to that of the controls, suggesting that they did not experience any severe feeding inhibition.\n\nCompound **5** also effected prolongation of the larval phase followed by reduction of the pupal weight. The larvae treated with **5** showed prolongation of the larval phase by 1.4 days (at 50.0 mg kg-1) and 2.6 days (at 100.0 mg kg-1) when compared with the control (14.9 days, Table I). The reduction of the pupal weight was by 17.8 and 25.8 mg at 50.0 and 100.0 mg kg-1, respectively, when compared with the control (262.5 mg, Table I).\n\nLarvae treated with **6** at 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg-1 presented reduction of the pupal weight by 30.0, 31.1, and 31.5 mg, respectively, when compared with the control (272.7 mg, Table I). This compound reduced the duration of the pupal phase by 1.2 days and that of the larval phase was increased by 0.6 days, while gedunin affected\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound or control & Content [mg kg−1] & Larval phase duration [d] (± SD)a & Pupal weight [mg]a & Larvae mortality (\\%)a \\\\\n**1** & 1 & 17.6 (± 1.25) a & 259.7 a & 10.0 b \\\\\n10 & 18.0 (± 1.72) a & 255.7 a & 16.7 b \\\\\n50 & 18.1 (± 1.43) a & 253.9 a & 40.0 a \\\\ Control & 17.4 (± 1.39) a & 260.8 a & 6.7 b \\\\\n**2** & 1 & 18.2 (± 1.61) ab & 271.7 a & 13.3 a \\\\\n\n## Page 5\n\nonly the larval phase by 1.3 days at 50 mg kg-1 (Table 1).\n\nOcotillone (**1**) isolated from the leaves of _Dysoxylum malabricum_ (Govindachari _et al._, 1994) was tested against _Spodoptera litura_ and showed excellent PFI (percentage feeding index) values comparable to those of azadiradione, epoxyazadriadione, and limonin (Govindachari _et al._, 1995).\n\nMethyl anologensate (**3**) exhibited insecticidal activity against _S. litura_ in no-choice tests (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh _et al._, 2002; Powel _et al._, 1991), and this result agrees with that observed in the present work. Isolated from diethyl ether and acetone extracts of the stem bark of _Khaya senegalensis_ (Meliaceae) **3** showed antidecatal activity by the conventional leaf disc method on the third-instar larvae of _Spodoptera littoralis_ (Boisd., Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at 500 \\(\\mu\\)g ml-1 (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh _et al._, 2002) in a study examining structure-insect antifeedant relationships of plants belonging to the Rutales order. In a dual-choice antifeedant bioassay against _Spodoptera litura_ L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), methyl anologensate (**3**) showed a PFI of 65.3, near to that of cedrelone (51.5). Two limonoids (sandoricin and 6-hydroxy-sandoricin) isolated from seed extracts of _Sandoricum koetjape_ Merr. (Meliaceae), which possess chemical structures similar to that of methyl anologensate (**3**), showed significant antifeedant activity against the fall armyworm (_S. frugiperda_), incorporated in diet at 25 ppm, and similar activity against the European corn borer (ECB), _Ostrinia nubilalis_ Hubner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), at 200 ppm. Toxicity results for both insects indicated that continued feeding on diets containing sandoricin or 6-hydroxysandoricin at the 200 ppm level would result in nearly 100% mortality prior to pupation (Powell _et al._, 1991).\n\nb-Photogedunin (**6**) presented the highest insecticidal activity against _S. frugiperda_ causing mortality of 53.3% in the larval stage and 20.0% in the pupal phase at 50 ppm. These results agree with those of Cespedes _et al._ (2000), who tested an epimeric mixture of photogedunin and their corresponding acetates and observed that these compounds caused significant mortality of _S. frugiperda_ larvae (45% to 100% at 10.0 to 52.0 ppm) after 7 days, as well as growth reduction, and photogedunin acetates showed the highest insecticidal activity at 10.0 ppm with 17% survival.\n\nCompounds **1**, **3**, **5**, and **6** showed moderate insecticidal activity at 50.0 mg kg-1 with 40.0, 40.0, 33.3, and 53.3% mortality, respectively, for the larval phase. Although the compounds tested here were less active than the positive the control gelatin (**7**, 63.3%), the use of these compounds, in particular **6**, is suggested for the control of _S. frugiperda_. Comparison of the activities of **6** and **7** suggests that oxidation of the furan ring led to a decrease in the insecticidal activity.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Controle Biorracional de Insetos Pragas, and Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) for the financial support and scholarships (CNPq).\n\nBraga P.

(RUBIACEAE). The present communication reports the isolation and identification of four triterpenoid saponins from the chloroform extract of the leaves of _Tocoyena brasiliensis_: 3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside, 3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside, 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside, 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside ester derivative of quinovic acid as binary mixtures, respectively. From the ethanol extract a flavonoid identified as ramazin-3_-O_-rutinoside was obtained. The structures of these compounds were assigned by data analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectrometry and comparison with data recorded in the literature for these compounds.\n\n_Tocoyena brasiliensis_: saponins; antifungal.\n\n**INTRODUCAO**\n\nO genero _Tocoyena_ (Rubiaceae), com cerca de 30 especies, ocorre nas regioes pan e neotropical1. Sao especies tipicas do Cerrado, sendo encontradas prefereicallmente no Cerrado _stricto senti_-_so_, mas tambem ocerran em florestas com clima quente e imido, como a Fluerasa Amazonica2. Todos os representantes de _Tocoyena_ sao arvores de pequeno porte ou arbustos. Este genero pertenec a subfamlia Ixoroidaee, tribo Gardenieae-Gardenineae, sendo os iridoides considerados se principal marcador quimiotaxonomico3. Investigacoes fittoquimicas previamente realizadas por nosso grupo sobre Rubiaceae, em particular _T. formosa_, conduziu ao isolamento de iridades glicosilados e nao glicosilados, una saponina triterpeneia derivada do cido quinvoice o un flavaned picosilado4.5. Alem de iridoides, a subfamlia e conhecida por metabolizar flavonoides, triterpenos, derivados fenolicos e alcaloides do tipo emetincios, quinolinocios e poliindoleninicos1.\n\n_Tocoyena brasiliensis_ Mart., conhecida popularmente como genipahipo, nao apresenta registro de trabalhos sobre sua compostaciona. Ensaios preliminares, objetivando a deteccao de substancias com atividade antifringa, indicaram para o extrato clorformico das folhas desta especie attividade fraca contra o funso filamentos _Cladosporioides_. O presente trabalho descreve o isolamento e identificacao de duals misturas binarias de saponinas triterpenicas e um flavonoide glicosilado. As misturas das saponinas **14**2 **c 34** **a**presentaram atividade moderada contra o fungo _C. cladosporioides_. As estruturas das substancias foram establecidas com base na analise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D.\n\n**RESULTADOSE E DISCUSSAO**\n\nO estudo fittoquimico das folhas de _T. brasiliensis_ resultou na separacao de dus misturas binarias de saponinas triterpenicas, a primeira contendo a cido 3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside-quinovoco7 (I) e o acido-3_-O_-b-D-quinovopyranoside-cinoblico (2) e a segunda, o acido 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside-quinovoc8 (3) e o acido 28_-O_-b-D-glucopyranosideoquinov6 (4). A saponina identificada como o acido 3_-O_-b-D-glucopyranoside-do-quinovoc8 (3) e o flavonoidde ramanzina-3_-O_-rutinoside0 (5) tambem foram isolados como substancias puras neste estudo.\n\nAs estruturas dos compostos isolados foram caracterizadas a partir da analise dos dados espectroscopicos (RMN de 1H e 13C, DEPT 135, COSY 'H-H, _g_HMQC, _g_HMQC, _g_HMQC, _t_OCSY 1D) e por comparacao com os dados disposinvels na literatura.\n\nAs quatora saponimas triterpenicas isoladas apresentaram como padro comun os C-27 e C-28 oxidados como grupo carboxilico. A coorfencia do grupo carboxiloa no C-27 foi evidenciada principalmente pela diferenca \\(\\Delta\\delta\\) no C-14 de aproximadamente + 13,0 ppm, quando comparado com a \\(\\alpha\\)-amirina (C-14 \\(\\approx\\) 8 42,0)11. A diferenca de deslocamento quimico deste carbono e decorrente do efeito \\(\\alpha\\) da carboxilia (C-27) em C-14. Assim, os esquelettes triterpenicas das saponinas isoladas foram identificados como derivados do cido quinovoc12 ou do cido cincholico12, bastante discutivoides e analisados na literatura.\n\nA ocorrencia da mistura binaria das saponinas **1+2** foi evidenciada no espectro de RMN de 1H pelos sinais em 8 5,49 (m) e\n\n## Page 2\n\n5,45 (m) atribuidos aos atomos de hidrogenio definicios (H-12). O espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C mostrou sinais para dois esqueletos triterpenicos, sendo estes sinais analogos aos observados para acido quinovi\\({}^{12}\\) e acido cincholico\\({}^{12}\\). No espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C foram observados os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 128,1 (C-12), 132,8 (C-13), 55,5 (C-14), 53,8 (C-18), 38,6 (C-19), 36,2 (C-20), 176,9 (C-27), 178,8 (C-28), 18,2 (C-29) e 21,2 (C-30), que caracterizaram o esquelet triterpenico de acido quinovi\\({}^{13}\\). Para a cido cicholico formar observados no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 125,1 (C-12), 136,8 (C-13), 55,4 (C-14), 43,2 (C-18), 43,0 (C-19), 30,5 (C-20), 176,4 (C-27), 178,6 (C-28), 33,2 (C-29) e 23,5 (C-30) (Table 1). No espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)P ode-se identificar a presenca de dois monossacarideos por meio de seus atomos de hidrogenio anomericos em \\(\\delta\\) 4,13 (d, \\(J\\) = 7.5) e 4,12 (d, \\(J\\) = 7.9), que foram correlacionados no mapa de como \\(g\\)HMQC as atomos de carbonos de carbonos de carbonos de \\({}^{13}\\)C, se presentavamente. A presencia de metila em \\(\\delta\\) 105,2 \\(\\delta\\) 105,3, respectivamente. A presencia de metila em \\(\\delta\\) 1,10 (d, \\(J\\) = 6.0) no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C sugerita a presenca de una unidade de raminose, porem os valores dos deslocamentos quimicos para os atomos de carbono nao eram compativeis aos observados para esse acqicar. No espectro de experimento COSY \\({}^{1}\\)H-H form observados as correlacoes entre os hidrogenio carbinolicos, que foram atribuidos inequivocamente aos ses respects carbons pelo espectro de experimento gHMQC. As constantes de acoplamento observadas para os H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(J\\) = 7.5),H-2 (\\(J\\) = 9.0), H-3\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(J\\) = 9.0) e M-H-4\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(J\\) = 9.0) para ambas as unidades do acjcar indicaram a disposicio diazali dos atomos de hidrogenio de carboidrato (Table 2). Adicionalmente, o espectro de gHMBC apresentou correlacoes entre o H-6\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 1,10 d, \\(J\\) = 6.0) com os C-5\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 75,5) e C-4\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 71,3); o H-2\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 2,94) com o C-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 2,5). A associacao destes dados alidas nos os didieratura permitam identificar a unidade de acjcar como a B-D-quinovi\\({}^{13}\\). A posicao da unidade do acjcar no C-3\\({}^{1}\\) C-3 foi determinada pela correlacao a longa distancia, observada no mapa de contorno gHMBC entre o H-1\\({}^{1}\\) e o C-3\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 88,1). Apos analise dos espectros de RMN e comparacao com os dados da liteatura fotosi posisyl identificar a substancia \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) como cido 3-\\(O\\)-B-D-quinovi\\({}^{13}\\). e a substancia \\(\\mathbf{2}\\) como ocido-3-\\(O\\)-b-D-quinovi\\({}^{13}\\).\n\nO espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C da substancia \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) apresentou sinais que revelaram a presenca de una saponina. Foram observados no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 128,0, 132,5, 55,3, 176,3 178,6 atribuidos aos C-12, C-13, C-14, C-27 e C-28, respectivamente, do esqueleto triterpenico. Alem do sinal de carbono amoriento em \\(\\delta\\) 105,6 (C-1\\({}^{1}\\)), outros sinais referentes a una unidade glacioscide formar observados. Os deslocamentos quimicos destes e dos demais carbons, com suas respectivas multiplicidades, apresentaram valores concordantes com os da literatura para o acidi do 3-\\(O\\)-b-D-glucoprianosdeo-quinocio\\({}^{13}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{3}\\)) (Table 1).\n\nO espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C da mistura \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) + \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) apresentou sinais que indicaram se tratar de una mistura binaria de saponinas triterpenicos. Apos identificado dos sinais attribuylos para a subsimetro \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) no espectro de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C observamar-se os sinais para cum segundo cido quinovi\\({}^{12}\\), caracterizado principalmente pelos sinais duplicados em \\(\\delta\\) 55,3 e 56,2; 53,7 e 53,8 atribuidos aos C-14 (\\(\\mathbf{3}\\)), C-18 (\\(\\mathbf{3}\\)) e C-18 (\\(\\mathbf{4}\\)), respectivamente. A diferenca entre as dusa substancias foi evidenciada pelos valores dos deslocamentos quimicos dos atomos de carboso mas unidades de acplicares. O valido de doselocamento quinloco de C-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 4) on 8 94,0 \\(\\delta\\) observado quando a glucose esta lida ao ao C-28, consouchencia de efte de blindagem da carbovia (Table 1). O espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D obtido pela irradiacao no H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 4,13, d, \\(J\\) = 7.5) da glicose exibu correlacoes com os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 2,93, 3.02, 3.05 e 3,10 atribuidos respectivamente aos H-2\\({}^{1}\\), H-4\\({}^{1}\\), H-5' e H-3' da unidade glicosdica ligada ao C-3, da substancia \\(\\mathbf{3}\\). A irradiacao no H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 5,21, d, \\(J\\) = 7.9),p aerum un espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D onde foram observadas as correlacoes com os sinais em \\(\\delta\\) 2,89, 2.99 e 3,12, atribuidos aos H-4\\({}^{1}\\), H-2' e H-3', respectivamente, pertencentes a glicose ligada ao C-28 da substancia \\(\\mathbf{4}\\). Os adados obtidos com o espectro de experimento TOCSY 1D aliados asso espectros de gHMQC e gHMBC e auxiliaram na attribuica o iso inequivoca das unidades de glicose. A analise dos dados de RMN 1D e 2D e comparacao com os descritos na literatura permitam identificar a substancia \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) como cido 20-\\(\\mathbf{b}\\)-D-glucoprianosdeo quinvoico\\({}^{13}\\).\n\nO flavonoide ramanzina-3-\\(O\\)-rutinosideo (\\(\\mathbf{5}\\)) foi identificado pela comparacao de seus dados espectroscopicos de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C com os registrados na literatura\\({}^{10}\\). A posicao da unidade de b-D-glucose no C-3 foi confirmada pela correlacao os espectro de gHMBC entre o H-1\\({}^{1}\\) (\\(\\delta\\) 5,38, d, \\(J\\) = 8.0) e o C-3' (\\(\\delta\\) 133,5). A posica do metroula no C-3' doa heel b do flavonide foi confirmada pela correlacao observada entre os a thidrogenio da metroula o da metroula (\\(\\delta\\) 3,83, s) e o C-3' (\\(\\delta\\) 147,0).\n\nA atividade antifringica detectada na fase clorformica das fol- Ihas de _T. brasiliensis_ contra o fungo fitpotagcinco _C. cladosporioides_ pode ser atribuida a presenca de saponinas\n\n**Table 1.** Dados de RMN de \\({}^{13}\\)C de \\(\\mathbf{1}\\)**, \\(\\mathbf{2}\\)**, \\(\\mathbf{3}\\)**e \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) (DMSO-\\(d_{v}\\) 125 MHz)\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\hline C & \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{2}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{3}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 38,8 (t) & 38,8 (t) & 38,6 (t) & 39,0 (t) \\\\\n2 & 24,2 (t) & 25,1 (t) & 24,1 (t) & 24,4 (t) \\\\\n3 & 88,1 (d) & 88,1 (d) & 88,0 (d) & 77,6 (d) \\\\\n4\n\n## Page 3\n\ntriterpenicas. As substancias isoladas e identificadas foram submetidas da nos nos ensios antifingcios, utilizando a tecnica da bioautografia3, para se determinar os limites de deteccao (quandidade minima da amostra, em mg, necessaria para inhibir o crescimento do fungo), sendo utilizados os fungas filamentosos _C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum_ (Tabela 3). As misturas (**1 + 2) e (3 + 4) apresentar antividade moderada (5 mg/mL) contra _C. cladosporioides_ em comparacao com o padrao nistatina (0,5 mg/mL) e nao inibiram o crescimento de _C. sphaerospermum_. Nao foi observada atividade antifingcia para a substancia **3**, este resultado e um indicio de que atividade antifingcica observada para a mistura das saponinas **3 + 4** pode ser atribuda para a saponina **4**.\n\n## Parte experimental\n\n### Proccdimentos esperimentais gerais\n\nOs espectros de RMN form registrados em DMSO-_d__o_, no espectrometro Bruker AC-200 F e Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrao de referencia.

St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani (Rutaceae) afforded new pyranoflavones along with the known compounds flavone, 7-methoxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, haplostusine, 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone alkaloid, b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and b-sitosterol benzoate. Their structures were established based on their spectral data. NMR data for the alkaloid INDIAMINA and the new pyranoflavones are described for the first time herein. These compounds were assayed on the tripmonsatiqute forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Among them, haplotusine and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone showed moderate values of IC50 136.9 and 144.9 uM, respectively.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nA doenca de Chagas, causada pelo protozoario _Trypanosoma cruzi_, e uma das mais graves endemias do Brasil. No Continente Americano, ela afeta 16-18 milhoes de individuos, sendo que 100 milhoes estao sob risco de contaminaacao.1\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nDevido a ampla distribuicao geografica desta doenca, a falta de tratamento eficza e seguro, e as graves manifestacoes clinicalas que ocasiona, a procura de novas substancias para a profilaxia e/ou tratamento desta emelia se faz necessaria.\n\nNeste contexto, as plantas sao valiosas fontes de novos compostos ativos e com baxica toxicidade.2 De fato, segundo un levantamento recente, 61% dos 877 novos farmacos desenvolvidos durante o periodo de 1981-2002 sao produtos naturais, ou substancias desenvolvidas a partir deles.3\n\nDe plantas da familia Rutaceae foram isolados alcaloides e lignanas com attividades triangucidas.4,5 Alem disso, as attividades sobre o _T. cruzi_ ou sobre sua enzima GAPDH (gliceraldedo 3-fosfatosdicofragase) de varios extratos e algumas substancias isoladas desta mesma familia foram determinadas.6,8\n\nFootnote 4: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nA especie _Conchocarpus heterophyllus_ (A. St.-Hil.) pertence a familia Rutaceae (ordem Rutales) e era anteriormente denominada de _Angostura heterophylla_ (A. St.-Hil.) Alb.9 Nenhum estudo fitoquimico sobre o genero cesorito na literatura. Erratumo, do genero _Angostura_ form isolados alcaloides acridonicos.10\n\nOs extratos e as fracoes de folhas e cuale de _C. heterophyllus_ apresentaram atividade sobre as formas tripmonsatigotas do _T. cruzi_.6 Neste trabalho sao descritos o isolamento, as atividades tripanocidas substancias obtidas de tais extratos/fracoes, assim como os dados de RMN do alcaloide haplotusina (**I**) e das piranoflavonas ineditas (**2**).\n\nFootnote 6: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\n## RESULTSADO\n\nO estudo quimico dos extratos e fracoes de folhas e cuale de _C. heterophyllus_, attivos sobre as formas tripmonstigotas de _T. cruzi_, permitu o isolamento de steroides, flavonas e alcaloides 2- e 4-quinolonics. A partir do extrato hexanico do caule de _C. heterophyllus_ foram isolados os esteroides b-sitosterol e estigmasterol;11 da fracao dicidomentaica proveniente de extrato hexanico das folhas, o benzoate de b-sitosterida12 e uma mistura de piranoflavonas ineditas (**2**) da fracao acetato de e tella deste mesmo extrato, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona3 e 5-hidrofilavona;4 de falrao acetato de e tella do extrato metanolico do caule, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona, haplotusina (**1**)15 e o alcaloide 2-fenil-1-metil-4-quinolona (**3**).16\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: paulo@dqu.ufscar.br\n\nTodas as substancias foram identificadas atraves da analise dos seus datos espectivocpicos e comparação com os da literatura. A mistura de piranoflavonas (**2**) esta sendo descrita pela primeira vez\n\nFigure 1: Substancias obtidas de Conchocarpus heterophylus\n\n## Page 2\n\nna literatura e as demais substancias, no genero _Conchocarpus_. Entretanto, os dados de RMN para o alcaloide haplottusina (**1**) nao estavam desritos.15\n\nFootnote 15: The _H_-H_ and _H_-H\n\n## Page 3\n\nces. Os resultados (Tabela 4) morsam que dentre as substancias testadas, as mais ativas foram os alcaloides **1 c 3**, apresentando valores de IC\\({}_{50}\\) de 136,9 e 144,9 uM, respectivamente. Entretanto, as substancias testadas nao mostraram ser potentes agentes tripancidas, principalmente quando comparadas ao quimio-profilatico violeta de genciana, cujo IC\\({}_{50}\\) de 83 uM, e com a lignana (-)-metilbrivatolideo, que na concentracao de 67,5 uM ocasionou 99% de lies parasitiaria.4\n\nApesar desste fato, os resultados dos testes tripancidas superram que as substancias isoladas podem ser os principios ativos das fracoes e extratos de _C. heterophylilus_, que foram attivos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do _T. cruzi.6_\n\nFootnote 4: A 30\n\n## Page 4\n\nrealizada segundo a tecnica descrita por Brener.19 Como controles, foram utilizados sangue de camundongo infectado, sem a adicao de nenhuma substancia; sangue infectado contendo a mesma concentracao de DMSO utilizada no preparo das solucoes e, sangue infectado contendo violeta de genciana (controle positivo), na contenracao de 1:4.000.\n\nAs substancias foram ensaiadas nas concentracoes de 500, 250 e 100 \\(\\mu\\)g/mL, para a obtencao dos valores de IC\\({}_{50}\\).\n\n## References\n\n* (1) Dias, J.

The phytochemical investigation of the flowers of _Pterogyne nitens_ (Caasalpinioideae) resulted in the isolation and identification of nine phenolic derivatives, quercetin 3-_O_-sophrooside, taxifolin, astilbin, ourateacetechin, caffeic, ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic and gallic acid, besides two guanidine alkaloids, pterogynine, pterogynidine. This is the first time these compounds have been reported in _P. nitens_ flowers. As this is a monospecific genus, these secondary metabolites may have taxonomical significance. Their structures were assigned on the basis of spectroscopic analyses, including two-dimensional NMR techniques.\n\nPterogyne nitens; flavonoids; guanidine alkaloids.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n_Pterogyne nitens_ Tulasse (Fabaceae - Caesalpinioideae), uma especie pertencente a un género monoespecifico, e popularmente cohecida como \"amendoin-do-campo\", \"amendoin-bravo\", \"ballsamo\", \"vyi-raro\", \"cocal\", \"tipa\" etc. Na America Latina essa especie arborea ocorre na Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguai e Brasil. No territorio brasileiro ocorre com freqiencia na regiao de Mata Atlantica e Cerrado comprerendida entre o Ceara tao Paran.1\n\nFootnote 1: Email: bozani@iq.unesp.br\n\n\"Amendoin-bravo\", como e popularmente conhecida no estado de Sao Paulo, e camplamente empregada na construcao civil de sas características da sua madeira moderadamente densa e resistente.2 _P. nitens_ também echocida pela belez a odor de suas fllores, bem como pela intensidade de suas follagens e frutificacao possui grande valor ornamental sendo, portanto, recomendada para arborizacao de vias urbanas e rodovies e na reposicao de mata cilier em locais com inundacoes periodicas. Esta especie habita os remanescentes de vegetacao paulista e encontra-se sob risco de extincao, fazendo parte da lista de especies recomendadas para a conservacao genetica no estado de Sao Paulo.3\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nFootnote\n\n## Page 2\n\nligacao do grupo metoxlico ao anel arornatico foi estabelecida pela correlacao observada entre os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,90 (OCH\\({}_{\\rm J}\\)) e 147.9 (C-3), no mapa de conformos _g_HMBC. Assim, a substancia **2** pode ser caracterizada como sendo acido ferdlico.7 Os espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H da substancia **3** apresentaram dois singlets \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,98 (2H) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,80 (6H), os quais foram atribuidos aos hidrogenios metricnics H-2 e H-6 e aos dois grupos metoxlicos, respectivamente. Os demais dahod espectrasimaram a posicao dos dois grupos metoxlicos nos carbonos C-3 e C-5 e permitam identificar a es-trutum alocular de **3** como sendo acido sinapico.8 Os dados dos espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C de **4** foram quasiez simalers aqueles observados para o acido cafeico **1**. Na estrutura de **4**, alem dos sinais de uma unidade de acido cafeico analisados a partir dos espectros de RMN de \\({}^{15}\\)C, foram diagnostics um conjunto de sinais compuiras e com una uladde de acido quintico. O espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H angerencus anisas teris hidrogenios metricnos em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,56 (dd, \\(J\\) = 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-4), 3,92 (d, \\(J\\) = 3,5 Hz, H-4) e 5,06 (td, \\(J\\) = 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-5) e para hidrogenios metilenicos na regiao compreendida entre \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 1,08 e 1,99 (H-2 e H-6), os quais confirmaram a presenca de una unidade derivada do acido quintico. A ligacao do grupo cafeofila a unidade de acido quintico foi estabelecida pela correlacao observada entre os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,06 (H-5) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 165,7 (C-9'), no mapa de conformos gHMBC. Os valores observados para os acoplamentos de H-4 com H-3 e H-5 indicaram una relacao axial-equatorial entre H-4 e H-3 (_J_ = 3,5 Hz) e axial-entre H-4 e H-5 (_J_ = 10,0 Hz) confirmando as posicoes diequatoriais para os grupos cafeofila e a hidroxila (4-OH). Os experimentos de NOSSY 1D mostraram um aumento na intensidade do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,92 (H-3) pela irradiacao do sinal atribuido ao hidrogenio H4(3,56) e ausencia de NOE quando da irradiacao do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,06 (H-5), consolidando a configuracao relativa proposta. Tais informacoes foram confirmadas com dados da literatura, indicando que a estrutura de **4** corresponde ao acido 5_-O-_cafeoilquintico.9 Os dados obtidos dos espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C permitiram caracterizar a substancia **5** como sendo acido galleo.10\n\nOs espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C permitiram inferir que a substancia **6** pertenee a classe dos flavonoides. Entre outras feicoes destacam-se o conjunto de sinais do espectro de \\({}^{15}\\)C em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 73,6,85,0 e 198,3 atribuidos aos carbonos C-3, C-2 e C-4, respectivamente, indicando que **6** possui a estrutura de um diidroflavanol. Um par de dubletos em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,91 (_J_ = 2,0 Hz, 1H) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 5,88 (_J_ = 2,Hz, 1H) foram atribuidos ao enel A 5,7,9,10-tetrassubstitution. Os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,96 (d, \\(J\\) = 2,0 Hz, 1H), \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,80 (d, \\(J\\) = 8,0 Hz, 1H) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,84 (dd, \\(J\\) = 2,0 e 8,0 Hz, 1H) corroboram o padrao 1,3,4-trissubtitude para o anel B. Ainda o espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H de **6** apresento um par de dubletos em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,90 (_J_ = 12,0 Hz, 1H) e 4,49 (_J_ = 12,0 Hz, 1H), os quais foram atribuidos aos hidrogenios H-2 e H-3, respectivamente. A constante de acoplamento apresentada por estes dois dubletos (_J_ = 12 Hz) sugere um acoplamento do tipo axial-axial, conduzindo a proposico de que o anel B e o grupo hidroxila 3-OH matem una relacao _anii_. Estes dados analisados em consomnancia com os de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)C permitiram caracterizar **6** como sendo taxifolina.11 Os espectros de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H e \\({}^{15}\\)C de **7** indicaram uma estreita similaridade entre **6** **6** **7**. A unica diferenca notada entre os espectros das daus substancias refere-se aos sinais característicos de uma unidade glicosifica en **7**. O sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 17,8, atribudo no acarbono mello C-6\" e o conjunto de sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 100,1 (C-1\"), 71,7 (C-4\"), 70,4 (C-3\"), 70,1 (C-2\") e 69,0 (C-5\") permitiram caracterizar a unidade monosficia como sendo una ramnose. O espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H demosstro a presencia de um dubleto em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,04 que foi atribudo ao hidrogenio amorrico H-1\", cuja constante de acoplamento de 1,5 Hz inferior a configuracao \\(\\alpha\\) para a unidade de ramnose. A correlacao deste dubleto e o sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 75,7 atribuido ao carbono C-3, observada no mapa de conformos gHMBC, sugeriu que a unidade de ramnose se encontra ligada ao carbono C-3. Os dados espectros-cos analisados para **7** indicaram tratar-se da estrutura da asti1bina.12 A analise polarimetrica dos diidroflavonosis **6** e 7 indicou valores de rotacao optica especifica de \\(+17^{\\circ}\\) (c= 1,02 MeOH, 27 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C) e-22\\({}^{\\circ}\\)(c= 0,82, MeOH, 27 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C), respectivamente. Esses dados sugerem as configuracoes absolus \\(R_{\\rm c}\\) dos carbons C-2 e C-3 presentes nas extruturas moleculares de **6** e 7, os quais es mostarram compufeis com os valores descrito na literatura.13\n\nO espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H da substancia **8** apresentou tres si-nais característicos de hidrogenios aromaticos: \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 6,53 (s, 2H), 5,93 (d, \\(J\\) = 2,0 Hz, 1H) e 5,95 (d, \\(J\\) = 2,0 Hz, 1H) indicando tratar-se tambem de una flavonoide. Os sinais correspondentes de dos sidinos principales em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,72 (dd, \\(J\\) = 3,0 e 17,0 Hz) e 2,86, \\(J\\) = 5,0 e 17,0 Hz) foram atribuidos aos hidrogenios H-4 e H-4b, respectivamente e permitam atribuidos a entrure de uma catequina para **8**. Os sinais relativos aos carbonos entre \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 100,1 e 157,9 e 29,1 analisados em conjuncao com as correlacoes observadas no mapa de conformos gCOSY para os hidrogenios H-4a, H-4b e H-3 apidaram a confirmar a proximacao de uma catequina para **8**. Os experimentos de NOSSY 1D foram emprogrados visando confirmar a esterequoimica relativa de C-2 e C-3. A irradiacao en \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,73 (H-4a) causou aumento na intensidade do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (m, H-3). A irradiacao do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,86 (H-4b) tambem levoa aumento de intensidade em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (H-3), indicando a proximidade destes hidrogenios. No entanto, pela intensidade dos NOE observados os sinais em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,86 (H-4b) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (H-3) estao posicionados na mesma face dho qano ed ano quala ligandos. A irradiacao do sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,73 (H-4a) tambem causou um incremento \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,78 (sl, H-2), indicando una correlacao 1,3-diaxial entre H-4a e H-2. Ao irradiar-se o sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,19 (H-3), houve am ganho de intensidade em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 4,78 (H-2) e \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 2,73 (H-4a) ccerente com una relacao _sin_ entre H-2, H-3 e H-4a. Estes dados analisados em consomnancia com as constantes de acoplamento destenis semis permitram atribur a configuracao relativa proposta. O mapa de conformos gHMBC demonstro como una intens correlacao entre o siennal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm h}\\) 3,80 (s, 3H), atribudo a um hidrogenio metoxlico e o sinal em \\(\\delta_{\\rm c}\\) 136,0, o qual esta relacionado ao carbono C-4', sugerindo que o grupo metoxila se encontra ligado ao carbono C-4'. A medida da rota-cao optica especifica de **8** [\\(\\alpha_{\\rm h}\\)]\\({}_{\\rm D}\\)= -58\\({}^{\\circ}\\)(c= 1,22, acetona) indicou as \n\n## Page 3\n\nconfiguracoes \\(R\\) e \\(R\\) dos carbonos C-2 e C-3, similares aos valores concentrados para a epigalocatequina.14 Os dados apresentados sao compativels com estrutura da ourateacacatequina,15 confirmando sua identifadec com **8**.\n\nA analise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracterizar a substancia **9** tambem como um flavononide. O espectro de RMN de 13C apresento os sinais em 8C 177.3, 155, 4 e 132,9 atribuidos aos carboneos-C-4, C-2 e C-3, respectivamente, evidencian-d do a subclasse dos flavonois. Os sinais em 8,144, 7 e 148,7 atribuidos as carboneos C-3' e C-4', respectivamente, evidenciam um flavonol cubo anel B encontra-se 1',3',4'-trissubstituido. Adicioanmente, os sinais de RMN de 13C comprentidos entre 8C 60,6 e 8C 82,6 analisados com os sinais de RMN de 1H em 8,566 (d, \\(J\\) = 7,5 Hz, 1H) e 8H 4,58 (d, \\(J\\) = 7,5 Hz, 1H) correspondentes a dois hidrogenios anomericos indicam dus subunidades de glucose c, com base no valor da constante de acoplamento (_J_ = 7,5 Hz) para estes dois dublets, verificou-se tratar de dues subunidades de b-glicose. Os experimentos de _g_HMBC demostrarami dus correlacces entre os dubletos em 8,56,6 e 8,4,58 atribuidos nos hidrogenios anomericos H-1\" e H-1\", respectivamente, e o sinal em 8H 82,6 sugerindo que a ligacao interglicosficia seja do tipo 2\"-1\". O mapa de contornos gHMBC de **9** tambem apresentou uma correlacao entre o sinal em 8,132,9 atribuido ac carbono C-3 e o dubleto em 8,56, fevando a conclusao que a posisao de _O_-glicosilacao se encontra em C-3. Pelos dados obtidos pode-se caracterizar **9** como sendo quercetin 3-_O_-sorofoso.16\n\nAnalise dos dados de RMN de 13C das substancia **10 e 11** indi- cou tratar-se de alcaloides de estruturas bastante similares. Entre outras caracterisas destacam-se a presencia de sinais em torno de 8,155, 7, e 156,7 (C-2) tipo de carbon guanidino e um corojunto de cinco sinais relacionados ase subunidades isoprotcilas em toro de 8,17,8/17,7; 8, 25,225,1; 8, 39,0/38,7; 8, 119,2/119,0 e 8,135,8/136,0. A analise desdes dados indicou que **10 e 11** contem um nucleo guanidinico substitudo por unidades hemiterpenodicas. Dado evidenciado por dos singlets em 8,12,62 (H-4') e d\\({}_{\\text{th}}\\) 1,68 (H-5') atributados nos hidrogenios dos grupos mettilicos; um dubleto em 8,372 (d, \\(J\\) = 6,5, H-1') e um tripole em 8,16(t, \\(J\\) = 6,5, H-2') relacionados ase hidrogenios metilenos e metilinco, respectivamente, para **10**. Da mesma forma, dados similares caracterizaram a estrutura de **11**, indicando que as estruturas em questao se tratam de alcaloides guanidino-prenilados. A unica diferenca entre os alcaloides **10 e 11** deve-se ao padrao de substituicao do nucleo guanidrinco. No alcalo **10** o anali 8,372 (_J_ = 6,5 Hz), atribuidos hidrogenios H-1', apresenta-se como um dubleto devido acoplamento com H-2'. Adiciammente, a anusencia de hidrogenio azorncito no asstrutura calodizica indicou o padrao \\(N\\),_N_-substituido para **10**, que foi caracterizado como sendo a pterognina.17 No alcaloidle **11**, a presenca de um tripleto em 8,7,72 (t, \\(J\\) = 6,5, 1H) devido a acoplamento do hidrogenio azorncito do nucleo guanidinico com H-1' da unidade hemiterpenicnica indicou que a substituica terpenica ocor nos nitrogenios vicinala da estrutura guanidinica. Analise de todos os dados indica que **11** possul padrao \\(N\\),_N_' de substituicao isoprotcilica. Fundamentado nestas analises, a substancia **11** foi caracterizada com a pterognilina,3 um isomero constituicol do alcaloide **10**.\n\nAs substancias **1-11** foram avaliadas quanto a sua capacidade de inibica sobre mieleporoxidase (MPO), uma heme-enzima abundante em polimorfonucleares (PMNs), e considerada uma macromolcule-chave na resposta immunologica inspecifica a varios agentes invasors, principalmente bacterias. A MPO e responsavel pela converso de pervida de hidrogenio (H,O) e anions clorte em agua e acido hipocloroso (HOCl) que, por sua vez, atua como um potente agente antimicrobiano. Alem disso, o excesso da atribuidade de MPO e subequiente producao exagerada de HOCl culmina em un intenso estresse oxidativo para os PMNs. A literatura correlaciona essa injuria oxidativa promovida por MPO e HOCl com inameros processos inflamatorios, tais como artritite reumuatodide, fibrose csticia, doenca inflamatoria intestinal (IBD), injuria pulmonar neonatal, etc. Dessa forma, a busca por inibidores de MPO a partir de fontes naturais forma-se de grande valia na descoberta de novos agentes anti-inflamidators.18\n\nDentre as substancias ensaadas com MPO, apenas as substancias **5**e **9** prostarram-se ativas, exibindo CI30 de 17,5 e 3,72 nM, quando comparadas a queretcetina, utilizada como controle positivos, que apresentou uma CI30 de 1,22 nM. O valor de CI30 da quercetina apresenta-se inferior aquele observado para o seu glicosde **9**, sugerindo a importancia de uma hidroxila livre na posicao 3 para atividade de inibica o MPO. As demais substancias maxima-se inativas (CI30 > 100 nM), including a substancia **6**, um analog hidrogenado da quetercina. Essa observacao supere que uma insaturacao situada entre os carbonso C-2 e C-3 no nucleo flavonolcio para uma acao inibitoria sobre MPO.\n\nOs extratos e fracoes obtidas das flores de _P. nitens_ tiveram sua capacidade antioxidante avaliada no ensaio em cromatoplacas reveladas com b-carotene, mostrando-se attivos, uma vez que mantiveram a coloracao laranja nos pontos de alpicacao. As substancias fenolicas isoladas este estudo sao provavelmente as responsaveis pela attivadade antioxidante desas fracoes detectadas pelo teste preliminar com b-carotene e que foi anteriormente relatado por Cai e colaboradores, que demonstraram a capacidade sequestradora de radicais livres das substancias **1-9** nos ensaios com DPPH (2,2-direni-1-picrilidrazila) e ABTS [2,2'-azino-di-(3-etillesponica-6-acidto sulfonico)].19 Atividade sequestradora de radicais exibida pelos derivados fenicos ven sendo amplamente discutida a la literatura e esta correlacionada a fatev mesomicros que conferemente a esse grupo funcional una alta reutividade com doadores de eletrons.20 Os alcaloides guanidinicos **10 e 11** tivera seu poder antioxidante avaliado sobre os radicais DPPH c ABTS. Os resultados indicaram que os alcaloides sao involveso de compPH (CI30 > 200 nM) e mostram atividade bia sobre o radical ABTS, apresentando CI30 de 87,7 e 190,0 mM, tendo a quercetina como controle positivos (CI30 de 7,64 e 3,12 mM para os radicais DPPH e ABTS, respectivamente).\n\nO estudo quimico das flores de _P. nitens_ culminou no isolamento de onze substancias de tras classes quimicas distintas: flavonoides (flavonois, diidroflavonois e catequinas), derivados do acidio e alcaloides. Dentre esses, somente as substancias **10** e 11 ja havim sido relatadas como preterentes ao melaboloma de _P. nitens_. Este trabalb permitiu concluir anda que os metabolitos secundarios acumolados nas flores desta especiac sao predominantemente de naturza fenolica. A descricao dos constituitunes acumulados em _P. nitens_ e tambem de grande valia tendo em conta que sua madeira verm sendo empregada indiscriminadamente pela construcao civil e, por tratar-se de um genor monoespecifico, esta leguminosa esta seriamente ameacada de extincao.2\n\n## Parte Experimental\n\n### Procellentos esperimentais gerais\n\nOs espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectromero Varian INOVA-500e operando a 500 MHz para o nucleo de 13C, TMS foi utilizado como referencia interna. Os dados de rotacao optica foram obtidos em polarimento Polamar A Carl Zeiss Jena. As analises por CLAE no modo analitico foram realizadas em equi\n\n## Page 4\n\npamento ProStar/Varian(r) acoplado ao detector ProStar 330(r) de arranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analitica Phenomenex(r) Fenil-Hexila (250 x 4,600 mm; 5 mm). No modo preparativo, as analisies por CLAE foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar/Varian(r) acoplado ao detector ProStar-UV(r), utilizando-se coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexila (250 x 21,2 mm; 10 mm). Nas separacoes em coluna aberta foram utilizadas gel de silica derividade C-18 (40-63 mm, Merck(r)), gel de silica para comatomagrafia _flash_ (35-70 mm) e para comatomagrafia de excluso molecular (Sephadex,(r) LHI-200). As analisies por camatomagrafia em camada delgada foram realizadas com rotamoplacas de gel de silica G60 (0,25 mm). Apos o desenvolvimento das comatomelacas estas foram visualizadas sob luz ultravioleta (l = 254 e 365 nm) e reveladas com solucao de anisaldedo em acido sulfurico seguido de aquecimento.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nAs flores de _P. nitens_ foram coletadas no Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo - SP, no mes de abril de 2003, pela Dra. M. C. M. Young. O material botanico foi identificado como sendo _Pterogyne nitens_ (Fabaceae - Caesalpinoideae) pela Dra. I. Cordeiro, do mesmo Instituto. Uma exsicata (SP204319) encontra-se depositada no herbario \"Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann\" do Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo - SP.\n\n## Extracao e isolamento\n\nAs flores (1,8 kg) foam secas a temperatura ambiente por 15 dias e, posteriormente, submetidas a moagent empregano moiho de facas. O po obido (1,5 kg) foi weado a macrogazo empregano hexanos e posteriormen maceração em etanol. Apos evaporacao, o extrata hexanico (3,8 g) foi analisado por RMN de 'H e CCDC mostrando tratar-se de uma mistura complexa de terpenos. O extrata etanolico (15,0 g) foi dissolvido em uma mistura de metanol:agua (7:3) e posteriormente submetido a particao liquido-liquido empreganado aceto de etile a _n_-butanol.\n\nA fracao AcOE (3,8 g) foi submetida a comatomagrafia em coluna de permeacao em gel (Sephadex,(r) LHI-20, 180 x 5 cm), eluida em MeOH, obtendo-se 25 subfracoes de 75 mL. A subfracao AcOE-17 (143,0 mg) foi submetida a comatomagrafia _flash_ em coluna de gel de silica (28 x 3 cm), eluida em modo gradiente (CHCl;MeOH, 100 a 50%), obtendo-se os acidos cafeico (**1**; 12, 0 mg), ferulico (**2**; 14,0 mg) e sanpico (**3**, 7,0 mg). A subfracao AcOE-20 (79 mg) foi submetida a comatomagrafia em coluna de fase reversa (8 x 3 cm) empregano mistura de MeOH:H\\({}_{\\text{O}}\\) (30 a 80%), resultando no isolamento de dois flavonoides, taxifina (6, 14 mg) e outaectaequana (**8**, 15 mg).\n\nA fracao _n_-butanolica (3,0 g) foi submetida a cromatografia por exclusao molecular (LHI-20, Sephadex, 180 x 5 cm) eluida em MeOH, resultando em 22 subfracoes de 70 mL. A subfracao BuOH-7 (280 mg) foi submetida a cromatografia em coluna de gel de sslica (28 x 4 cm), eluida em mistura de CHCl;MeOH (10 a 30%), obtendo-se dos alcaloides guanidinicos, pterognizino (**10**, 98 mg) e (96 mg). A subfracao BuOH-12 (120 mg) foi submetida a cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (10 x 3 cm), eluida em MeOH:H\\({}_{\\text{O}}\\) (1:1), obtendo-se astighina (**7**, 27 mg). A subfracao BuOH-18 (97 mg) foi submetida a CLAE-UV preparativo [MeOH:H\\({}_{\\text{O}}\\) (56:44), l = 254 nm, fluxo = 11.0 mL/min), culminando no isolamento do flavonol glicosilado (9, 18 mg).\n\nA fracao hidradocolica (1,7 g) foi inicialmente submetida a cromatografia de permeacao em gel (Sephadex,(r) LHI-20, 120 x 8 cm), eluida em MeOH, obtendo-se 13 subfracoes de 35 mL. A subfracao HA-5 foi identificada como acido galico (**5**, 11 mg) e a subfracao HA-12, como sendo o acido 5-O-cafeiolquinco (**4**, 22 mg).\n\n## Atividades antioxidante e inibitoria sobre molecoroxidase (MPO)\n\nPara os ensaios em CCD reveladas com b-caroteno, as amostras foram eluidas e reveladas com uma solucao dicloromentaica de b-carotene a 0,02%. Apos revelacao, a cromatolaca foi mantida a exposicao de luz solar atet total perda de coloracao. Os pontos que mantiveram a coloracao larania indicarama a presencia de substancias antioxidants:17. Os ensaios de capacidade sequestradora de radicais livres realizados para as substancias **10 e 11** seguiram prostocolos relatados na literatura com pequenas modificacoes.22\n\nAtividade inibitoria sobre MPO das substancias **1-11** foi avaliadas segundo o metodo de oxidacao do guaicaol. O meio reacional constituido de uma mistura de MPO (8,0 nM), peroxido de hidrogenio (0,3 mM) e guaicaol (70 mM) foi utilizado para a availacao da acao de MPO m a presena das substancias em estudo e do controde positivo que vierctica. As substancias from dissolvidas em DMSO nas concentracoes 0,50; 5,0; 10,0; 25,0; 50,0 e 100 nM. Apos o tempo de reacao (4 h), o meio reacional foi lido em espectrofotometro (470 nm). Atividade inibitoria foi expressa em Cl\\({}_{\\text{sv}}\\) valor calculado a partir da plotagem de um grafico correlacionando velocidade inicial _versus_ absorbancia, obtendo-se, assim, as curvas concentracao-resposta.23\n\n## Aradeccimentos\n\nA Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Programa BIOTA-FAPESP (Instituto Virtual da Biodiversidade, www.biota.org.br), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) e a Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES).

Fungos endofificos sao microorganisms que habitam o interior de um vegetal,1 em pelo menos por un periodo de seu cicio de vida. Apesar de seren productores de metabolites secundarios biologicamente attivos,4 sao pouco explorados.\n\nDando continuidade aos estudos de prospeccao quimica e biologica em fungos endofificos isolados de especies vegetais do cerrado, a espeice vegetal _Piper aduncum_ foi selecionada, pois a medicina popular relata proprietades diuretica, cicatrizante e anti-hemorradiecia.5.7 Dados fittopuimicos de _P. aduncum_ relata a coornercia de amidas, fenilproponoides, di-hidrochalcanos e derivados prenilados com atividades moluscida, bactericida e citotoxica.89 Estes fatos, associados as observacoes de que micro-organismos endofificos podem mimetizar a quimica de seus respectivos hospedeiros e produzirem substancias ou derivados com maior bioatividade,10 direcionaram o estudo quimico/biologico dos fungos endofificos associados a _P. aduncum_.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\ncom C-7 (d2 212,6) e comparacao com dados de citocalas-13(E),19(E)-dien-1,7,17-triona, 1possibilitarum a elucidacao do nucleo isiondolona.

Estas informacoes permitam estabelecer a configuracao relativa da inedita citocalasina **1**.\n\nAs substancias **2-6** form identificadas pela analise por EM, RMN de 'H e '1C, gHMQC, gHMQC, gGOSY e NOESY e por comparacao com dados descritros na literatura.13\n\nAs citocalasinas **1-6** (Figure 1) foram availadas quanto atividade antifinicas, frente aos fungos ftopologicos _Cladosporium clados-poioides e C. sphaerospermum_, usando-se o metodo da autoibografia direta.14 A substancia **5** movetu uma fraca atividade na concentracao de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrao nistatina (1 mg mL 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentarum-se inativas.\n\nAs substancias **1-6** form ensaiadas frente a linhagem mutante de _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica nao serem as responsaveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15\n\nA avaliacao da attividade citorakica de **1-6** foi realizada em celulas de maniforacos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cervix humano) e CHO (ovario de hamster chines).16 Para a linhagem aao cancergerica CHO, as substancias **2**, **3**, **5** e **6** apresentam IC50, de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As ciocalasinas **1** e **4** nao apresentaram IC50 nas concentracoes testadas, sendo que **1** foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada com padrao com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1.\n\nNa linhagem cancerigena HeLa as substancias **1-6** apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente. A cisplatina foi usada com padrao com IC50 = 5,0 mmol L-1.\n\nA forte attividade apresentada pelas citocalasinas **2-5** contra a linhagem canerigena HeLa e a fraca contra a linhagen nao cancergica CHO evidenciam uma seletividade destas substancias para as infagens tumorais HeLa.\n\nPara o nosso conhecimento, este e o primeiro relato de citocalasinas sendo produzidas por fungos endofificos associados a _Piper aduncum_.\n\n## Parte Experimental\n\n### Instrumentacao\n\nOs espectros de absorcao na regiao do IV foram obtidos em um espectometro Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectometro de massas de baixa resolucao da marca Fisons, modelo VG Platform II, no modo de ionizacao _electrospray_ (ESI). Os espectros\n\nFigure 1: _Estruturas das substancias isoladas de Xylaria sp._\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nde massas de alta resolucao foram obtidos em espectrometro QTOF (Micromass), utilizando-se como metodo de ionizacao _electrospray_ no mode positivo.\n\nOs espectors de RMN form registrados em CDCli e DMSO-_d__o_ no espectrometro Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrao de referencia.\n\nO aparello de cromatografia liquida de alta efciencia (CLAE) foi um Varian Pro Star, com detectores UV-Vis. As columas analiticas e preparativas utilizadas foram Phenomenex tipo Luna - C18 (250 x 4.60 mm, 5 mm) e (250 x 21,20 mm, 10 mm), respectivamente.\n\nOs meios de cultura liquido e solido foram submetiods a esteriliaz zacao em autoclave a 121 degC e 1 atm de pressao por 20 min.\n\n## Material vegetal\n\nFolhas saudaveis de _Piper aduncum_ foram coletadas na Casa Vegetacao do Instituto de Quimica - UNESP- Araraquara em maio de 2001.\n\n## Isolamento dos fungos endofticos\n\nAs folhas coletadas foram lavadas com agua e sabao, a seguir esteriliazas por imersao em NaClO (1%) por 5 min, seguido de etanol 70% por 1 min e lavadas com agua esteriliazada 2 vezes por 10 min, 1/32/ As folhas esteriliazadas foram assepicamente seccionadas em segmentos de 1 cm2 aproximadamente e colocados em placa de Petri, contendo o meio de cultura bata dextrose agar (PDA), marca Difco, preparado na concentracao de 39 g/L, acrescido do antibiotico sulfato de gentamicina e incubado a 25 degC. O crescimento dos fungos f orio monitorado diariamente e, apos cada cultura atingir de 1-2 cm em diametro, foram submetiods a successivas repicacas e detbencao das linagens puras. Forma obtidas ese linagenes puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Quimica Organica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como _Xylaria_ sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Colecao Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292.\n\n## Cultivo em meio liquido e obtencao dos extratos brutos\n\nO fungo endofittico _Xylaria_ sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 das. A seguir foi inculado em 20 fixesos de Erlenmeyer s (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentracao de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantios em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 degC por 28 das. Apos este periodo o caldo foi separado do micelio por filtarxio, extradao com ACoEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extrado com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fracao CHCl, (0,7 g).\n\n## Isolamento das citocalasins\n\nA fracao CHCl, (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de silica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco fracoes: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1). Estas foram analisadas por CLAE-DAD (Si C-18, gradiente H2O:CH,CN 5 a 100% de CH,CN, 40 min, fluxo de 1 mL/min), sendo detectada una alta concentracao de citocalasana no faxica pA-01-3.\n\nA fracao PA-01-3 foi submetada a CLAE-prep em fase reversa [A = 220 nm, 10 mL/min CH3CN:H2O (68:32)], resultando nas cito-calasinas **1** (5,5 mg, t8 = 71 min), **2** (17,5 mg, t8 = 32 min), **3** (30,0 mg, tk = 54 min), **4** (15,0 mg, tk = 26 min), **5\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n**Determinacao da viabilidade celular**\n\nPara a determinacao da ciotoxicidade das citocalasinas **1-6**, foram utilizadas as linhagens de celulas de mmiferos HeLa (tumor de cervix humano) e CHO (ovario de hamster chinos) na densidade de 2 x 10\\({}^{4}\\) celulas pocos\".

O extrato bruto foi solubilizado em MeOH/H2O (70:30, v/v) e submettico a partiacao com solventes de diferentes polaridades, fornecendo as fases hexanica (9,00 g), dicliorometanica (13,04 g), acetato de etila (4,82 g), \\(n\\)-butanolica (11,90 g) e hidroalcoolica (9,08 g). Todas essas fases foram bioensaiadas para averiguacao da attividade antifungica.\n\nParte da fase dicliorometanica (6,5 g), a qual foi a unica a apresentar atividade, foi submentioda a cromatografia em columa (CC) usando silica gel (70 - 230 mesh) e eluida com hexan/AcOEt e AcOEt/MeOH em misturas de polaridade crescente, fornecendo 22 fracoes, apos analise por cromatografia em camada delgada. A fracao 8 (690 mg, eluida em AcOEt/MeOH 80:20, v/v) foi submentida a CC utilizando silica de fase reverse C18, eluida com MeOH/H2O em gradiente decrescente de polaridade, obtendo-se 6 fracoes.

Maria Claudia Marx Young.\n\nSuspensoes contendo esporos dos fungos das especies \\(Cladosporium\\)\\(cladosporoides\\) e \\(Cladosporium\\)\\(sphaerosperimum\\) foram utilizadas como reveladores em cromatografia em camada delgada para a realizacao da biouotagrafia [12]. A monstra de extratos foi aplicada em cromatoplacas e eluida com solventes adequados. Apos a evaporacao dos solventes e localizacao das manchas por meio de absorcao no ultravioleta, uma solucao de glicose e sais contendo esporos do fungo foi nebulizada sobre as placas que foram incubadas a temperatura de 25\\({}^{\\rm o}\\) C em cama imida e escura durante 2 a 3 dia. Apos o tempo de incubacao, observou-se o crescimento do fungo sobre a placa. Nos locais onde existen substancias fungitoxicas surge um halo de inibicao.

Several members of the _Ouratea_ genus are employed for the extraction of edible oil, and are used as medicinal plants (Moreira et al., 1994; Agra et al., 2007). As part of our research program on the bioactive constituents of Atlantic Forest plant species, we have investigated _Ouratea multiflora_ collected in Juretic Reserve, Sao Paulo State. As result, four flavonoid dimers: heveaflavone (Geiger, 1986) amentoflavone-77,4\"-dimethyl-ether (Geiger, 1986), podocarpusflavone-A (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987) and amentoflavone (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987), Felicio et al., 2001), were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the leaves. Additionally, the biological activity of the isolates was also evaluated.\n\n## Material and Methods\n\n### General procedure\n\n1H and 1C NMR, inverse heteronuclear HMQC and HMBC as well as COSY experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument operating at 500 MHz for hydrogen, and 125 MHz for carbon, respectively. Pyridine-\\(d_{i}\\) or DMSO-\\(d_{d}\\) were used as solvents and TMS as internal standard. TLC was performed on precoated aluminum sheets (silica F254P 0.25 mm, Merck, Parmtadt, Germany) with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and by spraying with anisaldeley reagent followed by heating (120 deg C). Silica gel (230-400 mesh ASTM, particle size 0.040-0.063 \\(\\mu\\)M, Merck) or Sephaex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used in the CC fractionations.\n\n### Plant material\n\n_Ouratea multiflora_ was collected at the Botanical reserve of Jureia, Sao Paulo, Brazil and a\n\n## Page 2\n\nvoucher was placed at the Botanical Institute, Sao Paulo State, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nDried powdered leaves of _Ouratea multifora_ (118.0 g) were extracted by maceration using ethanol at room temperature. The extract was filtered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude extract (3.44 g) was dissolved in _n_-BuOH. Subsequent addition of water afforded two phases which were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The _n_-BuOH fraction (2.10 g) was solubilized with methanol/water (8:2 v/v) and partitioned with _n_-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate, successively. The ethyl acetate phase after concentration of the solvent (980.0 mg), was chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column with a gradient elution of MeOH/H,O. The separation was monitored by TLC, and eluted fractions exhibiting similar appearances were combined, yielding 20 fractions. Fractions 7 and 8 showed a solid precipitation. The solid was washed with cold methanol to afford heveaflavone (Geiger, 1986) (**1**) (21.2 mg). Fraction 13 was chromatographed on silica gel yielding amentoflavone 7\", 4\"-dimethyl ether (**2**) (10.8 mg). Fraction 15 gave a powder after precipitation. This powder was washed with cold methanol to afford podocarpusflavone-A **3** (Markam et al., 1987) (8.9 mg). Fraction 17 was chromatographed on silica gel using CHCl1; MeOH (4:6) yielding amentoflavone **4** (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987) (15.0 mg).\n\n### Antimicrobial assay\n\nSterile filter paper disks were impregnated with 20 mg of samples using DMSO as carrier solvent. The impregnated disks were then placed on agar plates previously inoculated with _Staphylococcus aureus_ (ATCC 2592) and _Bacillus subtilis_ (DSM 2105). Solvent controls were incubated at 37 degC for each organism, and after incubate time of 24 h at 37 degC, antimicrobial activity was recorded as clear zones (in mm) of inhibition surrounding the disk. The sample was considered active when the inhibition surrounding the disk was greater than 7 mm.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assay\n\nAntiproliferative activity was examined against two cell lines and was determined through an MTT assay as described earlier (Edrada et al., 1996).\n\n### TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\n\nThe protocol adopted for this _in vitro_ assay is described by Ellman and co-workers (Ellman et al., 1961).\n\n### Determination of the radical-scavenging activity\n\nThe determination of the antioxidant activity was tested according to a protocol described elsewhere (Cardoso et al., 2004; So; Lewis, 2002).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline H & **1** (\\(\\delta_{\\text{1H}}\\), \\(J\\) in Hz) & **2** (\\(\\delta_{\\text{1H}}\\), \\(J\\) in Hz) & **3** (\\(\\delta_{\\text{1H}}\\), \\(J\\) in Hz) & **4** (\\(\\delta_{\\text{1H}}\\), \\(J\\) in Hz) \\\\ \\hline\n3 & 6.63 (s) & 6.82 (s) & 6.81 (s) & 6.82 (s) \\\\\n6 & 6.23 (d,\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe chromatographic fractionation of the ethanol extract from the leaves of _O. multifora_ afforded heveaflavone (**1**), anentoflavone-7'',_A''_-dimethyl-ether (**2**), podocarpusflavone-A (**3**), and anentoflavone (**4**).\n\nThe \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR spectrum of compound **1** showed 31 signals, which were attributed to twelve sp\\({}^{2}\\) CH, including signals at \\(\\delta_{{}_{\\rm CH}}\\) 114.1 and 127.6, each representing two carbon atoms, three sp\\({}^{1}\\) carbons (\\(\\delta_{{}_{\\rm CH}}\\) 55.1, 55.5 and 55.9), sixteen sp\\({}^{2}\\) quaternary carbons and two carbonyl groups (\\(\\delta_{{}_{\\rm C}}\\) 181.6 and 182.2) (Table 2).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline C & **1** (\\(\\delta\\)) & **2** (\\(\\delta\\)) & **3** (\\(\\delta\\)) & **4** (\\(\\delta\\)) \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 163.9 & 163.6 & 163.8 & 163.9 \\\\\n3 & 103.1 &\n\n## Page 4\n\nThe 'H NMR spectrum showed signals for two chelated hydroxyls at d113.19 and 12.93 (OH-5 and OH-5\"), three aromatic methods) groups, a 1,3,4'-trubstituted aromatic ring (B ring) and a 1,4'-disubstituted (B' ring). The 'H NMR spectra [1D and 2D ('H-'H-COSY)] showed a _para_-substituted aromatic ring at d87.75 (d, \\(J\\) 9.0 Hz, H-2\"\", H-6\"\"), d86.82 (d, \\(J\\) 9.0 Hz, H-3\"\", H-5\"\"), two _meta_ aromatic hydrogens at d16.23 (d, \\(J\\) 2.5 Hz, H-6), 6.49 (d, \\(J\\) 2.5 Hz, H-8), commonly observed in a flavone nucleus. The structure of 1 was established on the basis of HMBC spectra, which showed heteronuclear long-range couplings of quaternary carbons C-7\" (d5 161.2), C-7 (d5 164.8) and C-4\" (d6 162.4) with the hydrogens of methoxyl groups at d87.72 (OR-7\"), 3.77 (OR-7\"), and 3.81 (OMe-4\"), respectively, and by comparison of their spectral data with those reported for hevealfavone (Geiger, 1986).\n\nCompound **2** also showed spectral features of a flavonoid dimer derivative (Table 2). The 'H MNR spectrum (Table 1) of **2** showed the presence of to chelated hydroxyl and at d87.83 and d87.75 two methoxyl groups. The 'H-'H-COSY spectrum of compound 2 showed a set of doublets at d87.766 (d, \\(J\\) 9.5 Hz, H-2\"\", H-6\"\") and d89.61 (d, \\(J\\) 9.5 Hz, H-3\"\", H-5\"\") of an AA*BB' system, besides the signals at d87.798 (d, \\(J\\) 2.5 Hz, H-2\"), 7.14 (d, \\(J\\) 8.5, H-5\") and 8.01 (dd, \\(J\\) 8.5; 2.5, H-6') attributed to a 1,3,4'-trubstituted aromatic ring. Furthermore, the 'H-'H-COSY spectrum showed signals with a _meta_ coupling pattern at d87.617 (d, \\(J\\) 2.5 Hz, H-6) and d.45 (d, \\(J\\) 2.5 Hz, H-8) corresponding to an A ring of a flavone. The HMBC spectrum of **2** revealed correlations of the hydrogen-bonded OH-5 (d112.94) with C-5 (d6, 161.4), C-6 (d8, 98.8) and C-10 (d87.73), while OH-5\" (d87.813 (d87.73), 132.0) correlated with C-5\" (d5 161.4), C-6\" (d5, 9.65) and C-10 (d6, 104.2).

Leite,1 Artur Placrees Neto,1 Alessandra R. P. Ambrozin,1 Joao B. Fernandes,1 Paulo C. Vieira,1 Maria F. das G. F. da Silva,1 Sergio de Albuquerque2\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe activity of crude extracts of three _Rapanca_ species (Myrsinaceae) and _Cipadessa fruticosa_ (Meliaceae) was evaluated _in vitro_ against the trypanostigote forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_. Thirty-three extracts from different organs of these species were assayed and eleven of them showed significant activity (lysis % >50). The fractionation of an active extract from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (99.5%) led to the isolation of two flavonoids: quercetin and taxifolain, which have weak trypanoacid activity. Additionally, one active extract from fruits of _C. fruticosa_ (97.7%) afforded mexicanotide limonoids: cipadesi, mexicanolide, febfirtigugin and cipadesi \\(A\\), that were slightly active on _T. cruzi_. Moreover, other two flavonoids (flavone and 7-methoxyflavone), previously assayed against _T. cruzi_, were isolated from the hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (100%). The results presented here suggest that the plants evaluated could be a source of new active compounds against _T. cruzi_.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nChagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis) affects 16-18 million people, mostly from Central and South America, where 25% of the total population is at risk of infection (WHO, 2004). It is caused by a flagellate protozoan, _Trypanosoma cruzi_, and transmitted to humans by blood-sucking trationine insects and by blood transfusion (WHO, 1997). With the control of the insect vector (_Triatoma infestans_), infected blood transfusion is becoming the major cause for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). The only trypanoicidal substance currently used to prevent the infection by this route is gentian violet, but its use is limited due to undesirable effects on the patients (Dias, 1993). The treatment of Chagas' disease is still a challenge, since the only current available drug (benzimidazole) has strong side effects (de Castro, 1993). Thus, the search for more efficient and less toxic drugs is needed to control this disease.\n\nIn the past years, the study of compounds isolated from plants has received considerable attention in the search for alternative chemotherapy of parasitic diseases (Serrano et al., 2000) and many natural compounds have been identified as trypanocides (Duschak & Couto, 2007;\n\n## Page 2\n\nGuimaraes & Faria, 2007). Several extracts from plants of Meliaceae and Rutaceae families have been showed _in vitro_ activity against _T. cruzi_ (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004; de Mesquita et al., 2005). Therefore, natural products constitute a promising source of new active compounds for treatment of Chagas' disease.\n\nIn this paper, we report the results of the evaluation of _in vitro_ trypanocidal activity of 33 crude extracts from different organs of _Rapanea lancifolia, R. guianensis, R. umbelata_ Myrsinaaceae, and _Cipadessa fruitcosa_ Meliaceae. Moreover, it is showed the trypanocidal activity of flavonoids isolated from hexane extracts from branches of _R. lancifolia_ and _C. fruitcosa_, as well the activity of four limonoids isolated from dichloromethane extract from fruits of _C. fruitcosa_.\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n### Plant material\n\nPlants were collected in different states of Brazil and identified by Dr. Maria Ines Salgueiro Lima from Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP and Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani from Department of Botany, USP, SP (Table 1).\n\n### Extraction and isolation of compounds\n\nThe powdered air-dried plant material was extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed against _T. cruzi_.\n\nThe hexane extract (9.3 g) from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (fresh weight: 1870 g) was fractionated through column chromatography on silica gel affording hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol fractions. The methanol fraction (1.5 g) was chromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, giving four fractions. Fraction 4 was fractionated in the same conditions to yield compounds **1** (3.2 mg) and **2** (3.7 mg).\n\nThe hexane extract (12.2 g) from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (fresh weight: 1524 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give nine fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1), affording nine fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 7 (16.7 mg) and **8** (8.2 mg).\n\nThe dichloromethane extract from fruits (15.0 g) of _C. fruticosa_ (fresh weight: 180 g), was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, resulting in the fractions: hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:1); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1); EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Fractions CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1) and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) were studied, as following described: the fraction CH2Cl/AcOEt (1:1) (5.0 g) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography on silica gel using a gradient elution (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH), resulting in the four corresponding soluble fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (2.3 g) obtained from the last fractionation was several times chromatographed on silica gel and finally submitted to preparative HPLC to afford for limonoids **3** (19.4 mg), **5** (8.1 mg), and **6** (8.5 mg). Limonoid **4** (48.9 mg) was isolated from fraction EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) (4.6 g) of extract through several chromatographies on silica gel.\n\nCompounds **1**-**6 were identified through 'H and '1C NMR spectra, 'H - 'H COSY, HSQC and HMBC experiments and MS. The spectral data of **1** and **2** were in agreement with those published in the literature (Kuo et al., 1998; Moon et al., 2001) as well as the data of limonoids **3** (Luo et al., 2000), **4** (Paula, 1996), **5** (Govindachari & Kumari, 1998) and **6** (Leite et al. 2005a). Additionally, compounds **7** and **8** were characterized by comparison of '1C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975). The _in vitro_ activity on _T. cruzi_ of compounds **3** - **6** is described herein. On the other hand, the activities of compounds **1, 2, 7** and **8** were previously reported (Ambrozin et al., 2004; Tasdemir et al., 2006).\n\n### Bioassay\n\nThe bioassays were carried out according to the procedures described by Ambrozin et al. (2008). The activity of crude extracts was evaluated in triplicate at 4 mg/mL and pure substances at 250, 100, and 50 mg/mL. It is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (mmol/L) for compounds **3-6** were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline Plant & Herbarium/collected in & Voucher number \\\\ \\hline _Rapanea lancifolia_ & HUFSCar - Department & 6700 \\\\ (Mart.)

Eleven of them (33%) showed significant activity (lysis %0 > 50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypanastigote forms of _T. cruzi._ The majority of the extracts of _C. fruticosa_ presented relevant activity. The best result was obtained from the hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFBH) that reduced 100% of the parasite number. The majority of the extracts of the three _Rapanea_ species assayed did not present significant results, since several extracts led to the total lysis of the parasites and the red blood cells, as well. However, some extracts of these species showed high trypanocidal activity without affecting the red blood cells, such as the hexane extract from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (RLBH).\n\nSimilar studies involving the trypanocidal activity of Meliaceae and Rutaceae species have been reported by our group (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2008) showing that these plants can be considered a promising source of active compounds against trypanastigote forms of _T. cruzi._ Thus, the significant results obtained from the extracts of _C. fruticosa_ are consistent with those previously reported for this family.\n\nThe investigation of the methanol fraction of the active hexane extract from branches of _R. lancifolia_ (RLBH) led to the isolation of the flavonol quercetin **(1)**\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Plant & Plant part & Solvent extraction & Crude extract & Lysis \\% \\\\  & & hexane & RLFLH & 76.8 \\\\  & flowers & dichloromethane & RLFLD & 72.2 \\\\  & & methanol & RLFLM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RLLH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\ _Rapanea lancifolia_ (Myrsinaceae) & leaves & dichloromethane & RLLD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RLLM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RLBH & 99.5 \\\\  & branches & dichloromethane & RLBD & 7.0 \\\\  & & methanol & RLBM & 47.69 \\\\  & & hexane & RGFLH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & flowers & dichloromethane & RGFLD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RGFLM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RGLH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & leaves & dichloromethane & RGD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\ _Rapanea guianensis_ (Myrsinaceae) & & methanol & RGLM & 68.5 \\\\  & branches & hexane & RGBH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & branches & dichloromethane & RGBD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RGBM & 6.94 \\\\  & & Hexane & RUFRH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & fruits & dichloromethane & RUFRD & 69.4 \\\\  & & methanol & RUFRM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & RURH & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\ _Rapanea umbrellaa_ (Myrsinaceae) & roots & dichloromethane & RURD & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & methanol & RURM & TL\\({}^{\\ast}\\) \\\\  & & hexane & CFFRH & 95.5 \\\\  & fruits & dichloromethane & CFFRD & 97.7 \\\\  & & methanol & CFFRM & 60.6 \\\\  & & Hexane & CFLH & 33.7 \\\\  & leaves & dichloromethane & CFLD & 92.8 \\\\ _Cipadesaa fruiticosa_ (Meliaceae) & & methanol & CFLM & 40.2 \\\\  & branches & bicarbonate & CFBH & 100 \\\\  & & methanol & CFBD & 76.1 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: _In vitro_ activity of the crude extracts (4 mg/mL) of _Rapanea_ species and _Cipadesaa fruiticosa_ on trypanastigote forms of _Typanosoma cruzi._\n\n## Page 4\n\nand the dihydroflavonol taxifolin (**2**). Several biological activities have been reported for these flavonoids. Quercetin (**1**), for example, presented antiprotozoan effect against _Plasmodium falciparum_ (IC\\({}_{50}=14\\) uM), _Trypanosoma brucei_ (IC\\({}_{50}=13.2\\) uM), _Leishmania donovani_ (IC\\({}_{50}=63.8\\) uM) (Camacho et al., 2002), _T. brucei_ and _T. rhodesiense_ (Williamson & Finnigan, 1978). In addition, this compound was described as a constituent of an aqueous extract from _Lychnophora pinaster,_ Asteraceae which showed trypanocidal activity (Silveira et al., 2005). Recently, high leishmanicidal activity was described for such compound (Tasdemir et al., 2006). Compounds **1** and **2** were previously assayed on trypantigote forms of _T. cruzi,_ but showed low activity (Tasdemir et al., 2006). The relevant activity of the original extract (RLBH) is probably associated with the presence of other compounds or mixture of them.\n\nThe mexicanolide limonoids **3-6**, isolated from fruits of _C. fruticosa_, showed significant trypanocidal activity (Table 3). They were obtained from the very active dichloromethane extract of fruits (Table 2, CFFRD, 97.7 %). This extract also afforded other limonoids (Leite et al., 2005a,b), which were not assayed herein. Recently, we reported the inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from _T. cruzi._ The results showed that crude extracts from _C. fruticosa_ showed high ability to inhibit the enzyme activity (Leite et al., 2009). Thus, this specie could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against Chagas' disease. In addition, the extracts from _C. fruticosa_ showed high inhibition of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), a key enzyme from _Leishmania_ that has been proposed as a target for the rational search of new leishmanicidal drugs (Ambrozin et al., 2005b).\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nThe trypanaccial activity of flavone (**7**) and 7-methoxyflavone (**8**), isolated from the active hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFBH), was previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active fraction of _Conchocarpus heterophyllus_ (Rutaceae), presented low activity against trypanastigote forms of _T. cruzi_ (\\(\\text{IC}_{50}=2116\\) and 787 mg/mL or 9531 and 1084 mmol/L, respectively) when compared with other flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004). Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites of C. _frutticosa._ As limonoids in the present work showed trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH extract may be associated with these compounds.\n\nThe trypanaccial activity of flavone (**7**) and 7-methoxyflavone (**8**), isolated from the active hexane extract from branches of _C. fruticosa_ (CFBH), was previously published by Ambrozin et al.

The present investigation reveals that _P. nitens_ extracts and fractions were more effective against _C. brucei_ and _C. parapsilosis_ than against _C. neoformans_. The growth of _C. albicans_ was moderately affected by all tested extracts and fractions. The strongest effects were observed for _n_-butanol fractions from branches (MIC = 15.6 mg/mL) and roots (MIC = 31.2 mg/mL) against _C. brucei_. Additionally, the chromatographic fractionation of the _n_-butanol fraction from branches afforded four guanidine alkaloids; _N-1.N.-2.N.3_-trisopentenylguanidine (**1**), described for the first time in the Fabaceae family, and nitensidines **A-C (2-4)**, which showed moderate activity towards _C. brucei_ (MIC = 62.5 mg/mL) and _C. parapsilosis_ (MIC = 31.2 mg/mL).\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe clinical relevance of opportunistic fungal infections have increased at an alarming rate in the second half of the twentyth century, including individuals infected with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer (Clark & Hajeh, 2002; Hage et al., 2002). The most frequent causing agents of such infections are _Candida, Aspergillus_ species, _Cryptococcus neoformans_, _Mucor_ and some unusual genera such as _Fusarium, Trichosporon,\n\n## Page 2\n\nand _Seedosporium_(Guarro et al., 2006; Nucci & Anaissie, 2007). Furthermore, the most common treatment for these infectious diseases involves azoles and polyene macrolides, which are limited in their spectrum, and presenting severe side effects (Helmerhorst et al., 1999). For this reason, there is a need for new antifungal compounds which can serve as lead compounds for further development in antifungal chemotherapy. In this way, plants have been proven to be a rich source of antimicrobial agents (Vieira et al., 2005, Alves et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2006; Sena Filho et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007; Batista-Junior et al., 2008; Cardoso-Lopes et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2008; Tempone et al., 2008; Bertucci et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2009a; Silva-Junior et al., 2009).\n\n_Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, is popularly named in South America as \"tipa\", \"vyi-raro\", \"cocal\", \"amendoinzeiro\", \"balsamo\" and \"amendoin-bravo\" according to the region where this plant grows. It is a sole beautiful legume tree from _Pterogyne_ genus, which is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, reaching 5-12 m height (Burkart, 1952; Lorenzi, 1998). Cold aqueous preparations using stem barks has been used as folk medicine for treating of ascaridiasis (Crivos, 2007). Previous chemical and biological studies have demonstrated the presence of guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity against to human cancer cell lines (Bolzani et al., 1995; Ferreira et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2007, 2009b,c) and phenolics with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging activities (Fernandes et al., 2008; Regasini et al., 2008a,b,c; Souza et al., 2009; Souza et al., 2010).\n\nThus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of extracts and fractions from branches, green fruits, roots and stem barks and isolated terpene guanidine alkaloids from _P. nitens_ against four opportunistic human yeasts (_Candida albicans, C. Brusei, C. parapsilosis_ and _Cryptococcus neoformans_), by using broth microdilution test.\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n### Plant material\n\nRoots, branches, green fruits and stem barks of _Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo (Sao Paulo, Brazil) by Ph.D. Maria C. M. Young in January 2005 and identified by Ph.D. Ines Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP 204319b) was deposited at the State Herbarium \"Maria Enedia Kaufmann\" of Institute of Botany (Sao Paulo, Brazil).\n\n### Extraction\n\nThe powdered shade-dried plant material was extracted three times (72 h) by macroation with hexane and, subsequently with ethanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation yielding a thick syrup. The crude ethanol extracts were further reconstituted in methanol-water (7:3) and then partitioned with ethyl acetate and _n_-butanol, successively. Samples from hexane and ethanol extracts, ethyl acetate, _n_-butanol and lyophilized hydroalcoholic fractions, were submitted to antimicrobial tests.\n\n### Isolation of antifungal compounds 1-4\n\nThe _n_-butanol fraction (2.5 g) from the ethanol extract of branches was subjected to gel permeation column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol to afford nine fractions (B1-B9), which were combined after comparison of their TLC profile [chloroform:methanol (9:1)] revealed with Dragendorff's reagent. The alkaloidal fraction (B2, 587 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase C-18 silica gel CC eluted with acetonitrile:water gradient that afforded eight fractions (ALK1-ALK8). Purification of fraction ALK5 (121 mg) by repeated CC over silica gel (230-400 mesh) eluted with chloroform:methanol in a gradient ranging from 0 to 35% methanol, furnished _N-1,N-2,N-3_-triisopentenyl)guanidine (**1**, 7 mg) and nitensidine B (**3**, 12 mg). Fraction ALK-8 (88 mg) was subject to preparative TLC developed with ch loroform:methanol:triethylamine (87:12.5:0.5), developed three times to yield nitensidine A (**2**, 7 mg) and nitensidine C (**4**, 3 mg).\n\nThe molecular structures of these guanidine alkaloids were identified through \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR, \\({}^{13}\\)C NMR and MS data. The spectral data were in agreement with those published in the literature (Bolzani et al., 1995; Conegero et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n## Microorganisms and growth conditions\n\nThe test organisms _C. albicans_ ATCC 90028, _C. krusei_ ATCC 6258, _C. parapsilosis_ ATCC 22019 and _C. neoformans_ ATCC 90012 were originally obtained from the Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Sao Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 to 48 h at room temperature.\n\n### Antimicrobial susceptibility testing\n\nThe antifungal activity tests were performed using broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications (Rodriguez-Tudela et al., 2003). The medium used was RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. Samples were diluted in DMSO and each well of a 96-well U-bottomed culture plate were added 100 \\(\\mu\\)L culture together with 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of 2-fold serial diluted test compound. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be 1 x 10\\({}^{\\circ}\\) to 5 x 10\\({}^{\\circ}\\) CFU/mL. This suspension was inoculated on the microdilution plate previously prepared with the extracts, fractions and compounds **1-4** diluted at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 mg/mL. The plates were incubated with agitation at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 24 h for _Candida_ spp. and 48 h for _C. neoformans_. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were used as positive controls exhibiting a MIC value ranging from 2.00 to 0.06 and 64.00 to 2.00 mg/mL (Table 1).\n\nThe MIC values were calculated as the lowest concentration of the test samples which shows complete growth inhibition of the fungi strains. Results were analyzed visually and spectrophotometrically. All assays were performed in triplicate. The extracts and fractions showing a MIC lower than 100, ranging from 100-500, 500-1000 and over 1000 mg/mL were considered potent, moderated, weak and not active, respectively (Holetz et al., 2002).\n\n### Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC)\n\nAll tested samples in antifungal study showing MIC\\(<\\)1000 mg/mL, were transferred to plates of Sabouraud-dextrose agar. The plates were incubated at 35 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 48 h (yeast). The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that did not permit any visible fungal colony growth on the appropriate agar plate after the period of incubation. All assays were performed in triplicate.\n\n## Results\n\nIn this work, eight extracts and twelve fractions as well as four guanidine alkaloids (**1-4**) were tested at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 mg/mL against four human opportunistic yeasts (_C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis_ and _C. neoformans_). These results were summarized in Table 1.\n\nAll extracts and fractions from _Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, were weakly active against the yeast _C. albicans_ with MIC values ranging from 1000 to 250 mg/mL, which were considered moderate to weak according to Holetz et al. (2002). The hexane extract from roots was not active to _C. albicans_ and _C. neoformans_ (MIC\\(>\\)1000 mg/mL). The extracts and fractions from roots and green fruits demonstrated moderate activity against _C. krusei_, except the _n_-butanol fraction from roots, which presented strong activity (MIC 31.2 mg/mL) against this yeast. Additionally, branches and stem barks exhibited potent activity against _C. krusei_ with MIC values ranging from 15.6 to 62.5 mg/mL and the best result was observed for the _n_-butanol fraction from branches (MIC = 15.6 mg/mL). Furthermore the hexane extracts and hydroalcoholic fractions from branches and stem barks showed moderate to weak activity against this yeast. All the samples had weak to moderate activity against _C. parapsilosis_ and _C. neoformans_, except for the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate, and _n_-butanol fractions from stem barks, which exhibited potent inhibition of _C. parapsilosis_ (MIC = 62.5 mg/mL).\n\nCompounds **1-4** isolated from _n_-butanol fraction of branches from _P. nitens_ inhibits the growth of opportunistic fungi with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.2 mg/mL against _C. krusei_ and _C. parapsilosis_, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of all extracts, fractions and guanidine alkaloids (**1-4**) were also evaluated against the four yeasts and showed MFC values higher than 1000 mg/mL, indicating a fungistatic behavior.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSeveral Fabaceae species have been evaluated for their antifungal properties (Scorzoni et al., 2007) among them _Pterogyne nitens_ Tul., Fabaceae, a typical leguminous plant from Brazilian flora has been studied for antimicrobial activity. Previous biological studies have demonstrated that extracts from the barks of _P. nitens_ did not show antibacterial activity (Salvat et al., 2001).\n\nThe bioactivity presented for compounds **1-4** indicated that antifungal activity observed in the extracts and fractions may be at least partially due to guanidine alkaloids. It was also observed that the strongest antifungal effects of the tested samples were on strains of _C. krusei_ and _C. parapsilosis_ when compared with _C. albicans_ and _C. neoformans_.\n\n### nitens\n\nand isolated compounds displayed\n\n## Page 4\n\nactivity against _C. lrusei_, which is very significant because this yeast has natural resistance against commercial drug fluconazole (Rex et al., 1995), suggesting its potential application for treating _C. lrusei_ infections, considering a possible mode of action different from those azole drugs.\n\nThe current study suggests that _P. nitens_ have antimicrobial activity against opportunistic yeasts. Therefore, it could be an important source of antifungal compounds which can be useful for developing new lead compounds, including compound **1**, which was described for the first time in the Fabaceae family. Further chemical and pharmacological investigations are thus needed in order to isolate and identify additional constituents and establish the potential mechanisms of action.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was funded by grants from the \"Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo\", FAPESP (Brazil), as part of the Biota-FAPESP-The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biota.org.br) through grants 03/021767-7 and 04/07932-7.

St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) permitu to isolamento de duas substancias ineditas: 4-metoxi-6-[2-(metilamino)fenil]-2_H_-piran-2-ona e acetate de _rel-(7R,8R)_-8-[(_E_)-3-hidroxi-3-metil-1-butenil]-4,8-dimetoxi-5,6,7,8-tetraidrofuro[2,3-b]quinolin-7-ila; e dos alcaloides arborinina, \\(N\\)-metil-1-hloroxi-3-metoxiacridona, esquinimana, occusagina, isodutaprina, isocesquinimana iscocoastigma. Arves da analise dos dados espectroscopicos foram establecidas as estruturas quimicas das substancias isoladas sendo que para os alcaloides ineditos tais dados sao descritos pela primeira vez. Alem disso, os ensaios bilogicos sobre as formas triopmastigotas do _Trypanosoma cruzi_ das substancias isoladas mostraram que elas possuem atividade tripanocida moderada.\n\nThe investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract from leaves of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) afforded two new compounds 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2_H_-pyran-2-one and _rel-(7R,8R)_-8-[(_E_)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofluoro[2,3-b]quinoline-7-yl acetate, along with the known compounds arborinine, \\(N\\)-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone, skimimanine, kokusagine, isodutaprine, isoskinaminine, and isokousagine. Their structures were established based on their spectral data, and for the new compounds these data are described herein. Additionally, these compounds were assayed on the triopmastigote forms of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ showing moderate trypanocidal activity.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe genus _Almeidea_ belongs to Rutaceae family and is widely distributed in Brazil. Data about the secondary metabolites of this genus are available. From _Almeidea guyanensis_ was isolated \\(C\\)-arabinosyl flavones, 2- and 4-quinolones, and flavone \\(C\\)-glycosides.[1] We have previously reported the isolation of triterpenoids, acridone, 2-quinolone, and fluoroquinoline alkaloids, and a new tetrahydrouquinoline alkaloid from _A. coerulea_ and _A. rubra_[2] besides steroids, one sesquiterpene, one cromone, and one flavone.[3]\n\nChagas' disease (American Trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_, affecting more than 18 million people in Latin America.[4] Its treatment is still a challenge and new less toxic and more effective drugs are necessary.\n\nAs a part of our search for new trypanocidal compounds and our studies on the chemistry of Rutaceae, a new specimen of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. was investigated. Thus, here we report the isolation, identification and characterization of two new substances (**1** and **2a**) and seven known compounds (**3-9**) from methanol extract of leaves of this plant, in addition to their trypanocidal activities.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of\n\n## Page 2\n\nmethanol extract from leaves of _A. rubra_ afforded two new compounds (**1** and **2a**) and known compounds (Figure 1) arborinine (**3**), _N_-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone (**4**),5 skimmianine (**5**),6 kokusagine (**6**),7 isodotudaprine (**7**),8 isoskimminanine (**8**), and isokkusagine (**9**), which were identified through comparison of their NMR spectral data with the literature.\n\nCompound **1** was isolated as a yellow powder and its structure was determined by analysis of NMR and LRMS.\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of **1** showed aromatic protons at \\(d\\) 7.33 (2H, m), and 6.70 (2H, m), assigned to H-4', H-6', and H-3', H5', respectively. Two olefinic protons (H-3 and H-5) appeared at \\(d\\) 5.49, and 6.23 (d, \\(J\\) 2.2 Hz) assigned to an 2-pyrone by comparison with a styryl-2-pyrone described by Pizzolatti _et al._,9 besides broad _N_-H and _N_-CH3 signals at \\(d\\) 5.36, and 2.87. Furthermore, a singlet at \\(d\\) 3.85 (3H) revealed the presence of the methoxyl group in the molecule.\n\nThe 13C NMR spectrum of **1** showed 13 carbons, distinguished as 5 quaternaries (_d_ 171.7, 164.0, 162.8, 147.6, 116.0), 4 aromatics (_d_ 132.3, 129.2, 116.4, 111.2), 2 ofelines (_d_ 100.1, 87.3), 1 methoxyl (_d_ 55.9), and 1 _N_-methyl carbon (_d_ 30.4). The analysis of 13C NMR and HSQC spectrum allowed us to attribute undoubtedly all chemical shifts to methyl, vinyl, and aromatic carbons/hydrogens of **1** (Table 1).\n\nThe assignments of quaternary carbons were possible from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-2' was deduced from 3\\(J\\) correlation between _N_-CH3 hydrogens (_d_ 2.87) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 147.6. C-4 (_d_ 171.7) was assigned through 3\\(J\\) correlation between the lowerfield carbon and methoxyl hydrogens (_d_ 3.85). Furthermore, C-6 (_d_ 162.8) and C-1' (_d_ 116.0) were determined through 2_J_-_J_ correlation to H-5 (_d_ 6.23). Finally, through the 2\\(J\\) correlation between H-3 (_d_ 5.49) and a carbonyl carbon at \\(d\\) 164.0 was attributed C-2.\n\nAll these results allowed us to propose the structure 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2_H_-pyran-2-one for compound **1**, which is described for the first time in the literature and represents a new class of compounds formed by the reaction of anthranilic acid and two acetyl/malonyl-CoA units.\n\nSingle crystal X-ray diffraction established undoubtedly the structure of **1** as a derivative of anthranilic acid (Figure 2).\n\nThe crystal structure of compound **1** shows the presence of two independent molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure 2). The main conformational difference between both independent molecules is centered in the dihedral angle between the least square planes that pass through the aromatic rings in each molecule. The value of this angle in molecule 1 is 33.58(8)deg and in molecule 2 is 34.79(8)deg. The crystal structure also shows the presence of one intramolecular interaction in each molecule. These interactions are slightly different due to the conformation\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & HSQC & & HMBC \\\\ Carbon & _δ_c & _δ_H (_J_Ca) & _χ_Ca & _χ_Ca \\\\\n2 & 164.0 & & & \\\\\n3 & 87.3 & 5.49 d (_J_ 2.2 Hz) & 171.7, 164.0 & 100.1 \\\\\n4 & 171.7 & & & \\\\\n5 & 100.1 & 6.23 d (_J_ 2.2 Hz) & 171.7, 162.8 & 116.0, 87.3 \\\\\n6 & 162.8 & & & \\\\\n1’ & 116.0 & & & \\\\\n2’ & 147.6 & & & \\\\\n3’ and 5’ & 116.4, 111.2 & 6.70 m & 147.6, 132.3, 129.2 & 116.0 \\\\\n4’ and 6’ & 132.3, 129.2 & 7.33 m & & 162.8, 147.6 \\\\\n4-OCHi & 55.9 & 3.85 s & & 171.7 \\\\\n2’-/NCH3 & 30.4 & 2.87 s & & 147.6 \\\\\n2’-/NH & - & 5.36 br s & & \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: NMR spectral data (CDCl_γ_, 9.8 T) of substance **1** isolated from _Almeida rubra_\n\nFigure 1: Compounds isolated from _Almeida rubra_.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\nchanges. The analyses of the crystal packing show the presence of four intermolecular interactions of the type C-H...O that give rise to the formation of chains along the (101) direction. These chains are connected with the chain just above and below it through three intermolecular interactions of the N-H...O type.\n\nThe quinoline and acridine alkaloids, which are widely distributed in Rutaceae, arise from combination of anthranilic acid and acetate/malonate.10 In these cases, the ciclization takes place by nucleophilic attack of nitrogen atom to the carboxyl carbon. However, compound **1** should be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom to the carboxyl carbon, giving rise an _a_-pyrone.\n\nWe have previously reported the isolation of the new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid **2b** (Figure 1) from _A. coerulea.2_ Reinvestigation of _A. rubra_ afforded an alkaloid **2a** whose spectral data seem to be very similar to those of **2b**. This alkaloid was isolated as a white powder and identified by NMR and LRMS. The molecular formula C20H25NO6 of **2a** was defined by elemental analysis.\n\nIn the 1H NMR spectrum of **2a** were observed a pair of doublets (_J_ 2.6 Hz) at \\(d\\) 7.58 and 6.97, and a singlet at \\(d\\) 4.30, which indicate that **2a** was a tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid. The signals at \\(d\\) 2.78, 2.20, and 2.01, assigned to H-5, and H-6, respectively, confirmed that **2a** had a reduced fluoroquinoline ring.\n\n1H NMR spectrum of **2a** also showed two singlets at \\(d\\) 3.14, and 2.03, and a group of signals at \\(d\\) 6.06 (d, \\(J\\) 16.1 Hz), 5.69 (d, \\(J\\) 16.1 Hz), 1.34 (s), and 1.31 (s), which indicated the presence of the 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent. Through the spectral data comparison, it was established that **2a** distinguished from **2b** by the presence of 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent instead of \\(g\\),_g_-dimethylallyl moiety.\n\nAnalysis of HSQC correlations and literature data2 allowed us to attribute undoubtedly chemical shifts to methyl, methylene, vinyl, furanyl hydrogen/carbon of **2a** (Table 2).\n\nThe assignments of quaternary carbons of **2a** were made from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-4 was deduced from 3\\(J\\) correlation between methoxyl hydrogens at C-4 (_d_ 4.30) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 158.2. The correlation of the other methoxyl hydrogens (_d_ 3.14) and one carbon at \\(d\\) 79.7 determined\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Carbon & \\(\\delta_{\\text{C}}\\) & HSQC & HMBC \\\\\n4 & 162.7 & & & \\\\\n3 & 105.2 & & & \\\\\n4 & 158.2 & & & \\\\\n4a & 117.6 & & & \\\\\n5 & 19.5 & 2.78 m & 117.6, 23.5 & 158.2, 150.0, 72.6 \\\\\n6 & 23.5 & 2.20, 2.01 m & 72.6, 19.5 & 117.6, 79.7 \\\\\n7 & 72.6 & 5.43 dd (_J_ 8.5, 2\n\n## Page 4\n\nC-8. C-4a was assigned through correlation between the carbon at d 117.6 and H-5, and H-6 (d 2.78, and 2.01). H-5 also correlated to C-8a (d 150.0). Furthermore, methyl hydrogens at d 1.34, and 1.31, correlated with an oxygenated carbon at d 70.8, establishing C-3\". Finally, the correlation between furanyl hydrogens (d 7.58, and 6.97) and quaternary carbons at d 162.7, and 105.2 determined C-2, and C-3, respectively.\n\nThe close similarity between the chemical shifts observed for carbons of reduced fluoroquinoline ring when compared with the model compound 7-_O_-acetylha-plophyllidine (**2b**)2 led us to suggest a _trans_ relationship between the 7-acetoxy and 8-methoxy groups. Alkaloid **2a**, _rel_-(7\\(R\\),8_R_)-8-[(_E_)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro [2,3-_b_]quinoline-7-yl acetate, is described for the first time in the literature, and the occurrence of tetrahydrouroquinoline alkaloid such as **2a** and **2b** seems to be restricted to the genera _Almeidea_ and _Haplophyllum_ of Rutaceae family.2,11\n\nIn order to improve the therapy of Chagas disease, we have been studying species of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, Burseraceae, and Cheoraceae) aiming to isolate hit compounds that could be used in the development of new antichagasic drugs.\n\nCompounds described in this paper were isolated from an active fraction of _A. rubra_ (62.9% lysis - percent reduction of the parasite number) on the tripomastigote forms of _T. cruzi_.12 Their _in vitro_ trypanocidal actions are shown on Table 3. Three of them (**7**-**9**) could not be assayed due to their instability.\n\nThe results showed that all of compounds had moderate trypanocidal actions and kokusagine (**6**) was the most active one. Probably, they are responsible by the activity of the _A. rubra_ fraction.12 However, they could not be considered good prototype for the development of new antichagasic drugs, mainly when their activities are compared with crystal violet and some lignans also isolated from other Rutaceae.13\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nThe 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using either Bruker DRX-200 and ARX-400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard.\n\nLow resolution EIMS were recorded on GC-17A, GCMS-QP5000 Shimadzu.\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe leaves of _Almeidea rubra_ A. St.-Hil. were collected in May 2000 in Espirito Santo State, southeast of Brazil. The plant material was identified by Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani _et al_. 4746) was deposited at the Herbarium of that Department.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nDried leaves (313.5 g) were extracted first with hexane and then with MeOH at room temp. Part of the methanol extract (15.9 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield the corresponding fractions (ALFMH, ALFMD, ALFMA, ALFMM). The fraction ALFMA (3.3208 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 410 x 43 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give eleven fractions.\n\nThe second fraction (ALFMA2; 0.6302 g) was chromatographed on silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 358 x 31 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:AcOEt 8:2-MeOH) to afford ten fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) from the fraction five (ALFMA2,5; 103.6 mg) was obtained four fractions. Then, the second fraction (ALFMA2,5,2; 68.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient) to give four fractions. The third fraction (ALFMA2,5,2,3; 36.0 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (1:1) to afford six fractions. Through column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient) of the fraction five (ALFMA2,5,2,3,5; 14.3 mg) was isolated the alkaloid **2a** (2.6 mg).\n\nFraction four (ALFMA4; 178.1 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Compound & Concentration (μg/mL) & x Lysis \\% & IC50 \\\\\n500 & 250 & 100 & (mmol/L) \\\\\n**1** & 74.10 & 45.08 & 27.23 & 1.271 \\\\\n**2a** & 58.93 & 44.20 & 28.12 & 0.977 \\\\\n**3** & 57.99 & 42.39 & 24.00 & 1.231 \\\\\n**4** & 45.60 & 43.20 & 31.20 & 2.600 \\\\\n**5** & 65.17 & 30.35 & 25.44 & 1.455 \\\\\n**6** & 58.38 & 57.13 & 46.58 & 0.5596 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Trypanocidal activity of compounds isolated from _Almeidea rubra_\n\n## Page 5\n\nand eluted with MeOH to afford five fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) of the third fraction (ALFMA4,3; 59.9 mg) was obtained the alkaloid **5** (ALFMA4,3,7; 2.5 mg) and eight fractions. Then, the fourth fraction (ALFMA4,3,4; 2.3 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (332 x 25 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) to give three fractions. Further purification of the fraction two (ALFMA4,3,4,2; 2.0 mg) on preparative planar silica plate with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) afforded alkaloid **6** (1.6 mg). Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH) of the fraction five (ALFMA4,3,5; 21.5 mg) was isolated the compound **1** (14.7 mg).\n\nThe alkaloids arborinine (**3**) (43.2 mg), isodotudaprine (**7**) (25.6 mg), and isoskimminanine (**8**) (28.8 mg) were crystallized in MeOH from fraction six (ALFMA6; 104.5 mg), seven (ALFMA7; 317.3 mg) and nine (ALFMA9; 120.5 mg), respectively.\n\nThe other alkaloid isokokusagine (**9**) (32.1 mg) was purified on sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH) from fraction eight (ALFMA8; 90.3 mg), and the alkaloid **4** (3.2 mg) was obtained from fraction three (148.8 mg).\n\n#### 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one (1)\n\nYellow powder; elemental analysis (Found: C, 68.0432; H, 5.565904; N, 6.11885.

Data were collected up to 50deg in 2_th_, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;14 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.15 No absorption corrections were applied.\n\nThe structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.16 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.17 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. The programs SHELXL-97,17 and ORTEP-318 were used within WinGX19 to prepare materials for publication. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles, and thermal parameters have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.\n\nThe supplementary crystallographic data have been sent in electronic format to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, as CIF file No. CCDC 242119.

The infected blood was diluted with healthy mice blood to achieve a concentration of 2.106 forms/mL. Solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The activities of substances were evaluated at 500, 250, and 100 _m_g/mL.\n\nThe bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) which contained 400 _m_L mixture/well. The plates were incubated at 4 degC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h, following the method described by Brener.20\n\nInfected blood with the same volume of DMSO was used as control, and gentian violet to a concentration of 250 _m_g/mL was used as positive control.\n\nThe activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 values were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to FAPESP and CNPq for the \n\n## Page 6\n\nfinancial support and to Dr Jose Rubens Pirani for collecting and identifying the _Almeidea rubra_ specimen.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Jay, M.; Gleye, J.; Bouillant, M.L.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Phytochemistry_**1979**, _18_, 184 ; Moulis, C.; Wirasutisna, K.R.; Gleye, J.; Loiseau, P.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Pytochemistry_**1983**, _22_, 2095; Wirasutisna, K.R.; Gleye, J.; Moulis, C.; Stanislas, E.; Moretti, C.; _Pytochemistry_**1986**, _25_, 558.\n* [2] Santos, C.S.; Januario, A.H.; Vieira, P.C.; Fernandes, J.B.; Da Silva, M.F.G.F.; Pirani, J.R.; _J.

Their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments as quercetin-3-_O_-rutinoside (**2**), kaempferol-3-_O_-rutinoside (**3**), kaempferol-3-_O_-_a_-L-rhamnopyranoside-(1-9-6)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactopyranoside (**4**), quercetin-3-_O_-\\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranoside-[(1-4)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-galactopyranoside (**5**), 6-hydroxy-rutin (**6**), kaempferol-3-_O_-D-galactopyranoside (**7**), kaempferol-3-_O_-\\(\\beta\\)-glucopyranoside (**8**) and kaempferol-3-_O_-\\(\\alpha\\)-L-rhamnopyranoside)-[(1-4)-\\(\\beta\\)-D-glucopyranoside (**9**). In addition, catechoin (**10**) and catechin-(4-\\(\\alpha\\)-8)-catechin-procyanidin B-3) (**11**) were isolated. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative properties using an autographic assay based on \\(\\beta\\)-carotene bleaching on TLC plates, and spectrophotometric detection by reduction of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Flavonoids **2**, **5**, **6**, **10** and **11** displayed strong free radical scavenging activity, when compared with the standards BHT and rutin.\n\n**Keywords**: Rubiaceae, chimarrhoside, DPPH, \\(\\beta\\)-carotene\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn recent years, flavonoids have been widely recognized as a major class of secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties due to their ability to scavenge free radicals.[1, 2, 3] Antioxidant is a broad classification for molecules that may act prior to, or during, a free radical chain reaction at initiation, propagation, termination, decomposition, or subsequent reaction of oxidation products as sensitive targets.[4] There are several diseases, whose causes and severity are linked to oxidation, mainly those associated with oxygen free radicals, which have been implicated as mediators of degenerative and chronic deteriorative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases,[5] such as rheumatoid arthritis,[6] diabetes, vascular disease and hypertension, cancer and hyperplastic diseases,[7] cataract formation and aging processes.[8] Radical-mediated pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion, asthma and many others involving an imbalance in pro-oxidant-antioxidant processes.[9] In our search for antioxidant compounds from Amazonian plant species, we examined constituents of \\(Chimarrhis\\)\\(turbinata\\) DC Rodr.. (Rubiaceae) leaves, collected in the city of Belem, Para State, Brazil. The chemical composition of _C. turbinata_ has been studied previously, and bioactive indole alkaloids were identified.[10, 12] In this paper, we describe the isolation \n\n## Page 2\n\nof a new bifluxonoid, named chimarrhoside (**1**), and eight known flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant effects, which were deduced by electrochemical detection coupled to an HPLC system, bleaching of _b_-carotene on TLC plates, and parameters related to the evaluation of antioxidant activity measured by free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nChimarrhoside (**1**) was obtained as an amorphous pale yellow powder from the EtOH extract and exhibited in its mass spectrum a molecular ion peak at _m/z_ 1171 [M+H]+ obtained from ESIMS. The IR and UV spectra of **1** revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (270, 295, 344 nm, 1690 cm-1). Part of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of compound **1** were observed in duplicate, suggesting a dimer (Table 1). Comparison of the 13C NMR values of **1** with literature data13 evidenced the kaempfero1 algvcone and additional similar spectral features to those of **3**, also isolated in this work, except for the duplication of some signals for carbons arising from a dimer structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum of **1**, signals for two kaempfero1 units as two _meta_-coupled A-ring hydrogens (H-6/H-8) and two pairs of coupled B-ring hydrogens (H-3'/H-5' and H-2'/H-6') for each aglycone were observed, in addition to four anomeric hydrogens at \\(d\\) 5.12 (1H, \\(d\\), \\(J\\) 7.7 Hz), 5.02 (1H, d, \\(J\\) 7.7 Hz), 4.40 (1H, br s), 4.60 (1H, br s), 20 hydroxymethine and 2 hydroxymethylene hydrogens. The 13C NMR spectrum of **1** revealed the presence of two kaempfero1 moieties and 24 hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene signals which, analyzed together with 1H NMR data (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of two diglycoside moieties identified as rutinosyl and a-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside. This assumption was supported by signals at \\(d\\) 103.1 / 67.1 and \\(d\\) 104.0 / 65.9, assigned to C-1\" C-6\" of the glucopyranosyl and of the galactopyranosyl moiety respectively. Those signals also showed HMQC correlations with H-1\" (anomeric) and H-6\" (Table 1); as well as signals at \\(d\\) 100.9/16.4 and \\(d\\) 100.4/16.6, assigned to C-1'''/C-6''' of the two rhamnopyranosyl moieties, respectively, which also showed HMQC correlations with H-1''' (_d_ 4.4 0 and 4.60) and H-6''' (_d_ 1.17 and 1.11). On the basis of the above data, the chemical shifts assigned for each sugar: the glucosyl and galactosyl moieties were confirmed taking into account the values at \\(d\\) 103.1, 76.6, 75.7, 74.3, 70.1 and 67.1 as well as \\(d\\) 104.0, 73.9, 73.6, 71.5, 68.2 and 65.9 attributed to glucose and galactose, respectively.15 According to literature data, using the same solvent, the chemical shifts of hydroxymethines carbons in glucose are quite deshielded when compared to those of galactose. The glucosyl/galactosyl groups are linked to the rhamnosyl residue at C-6\", because the signal assigned to this carbon, in both sugar moieties, was markedly displaced downfield at \\(d\\) 67.1/65.9 (D_d_ + 6), respectively when compared with the 13C NMR spectrum of free hydroxymethylenes in glucose/galactose. This also was confirmed by the observation of a HMBC long-range correlation of the anomeric hydrogen signal of the rhamnosyl group at \\(d\\) 4.40 / 4.60 with C-6\" of the glucosyl moieties at 67.1 and 65.9, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the site of glycosylation at C-3 of each kaempfero1 moiety was evidenced from downfield shifts of C-2 (D_d_ +9) and C-4 (D_d_ +2) and upfield shift of C-3 (D_d_ -3) when compared to the aglycone,15 as well as from HMBC correlations of H-1\" to C-3a/3b within each kaempfero1 diglycoside moiety (Figure 1). Further HMBC correlations of H-6 and H-8 with C-7 (_d_ 164.6) confirmed the assignments for ring A and suggested the interflavonoidic linkage at C-7 due to the observed downfield shift of its signal when compared to the monomer.15 Moreover, ESIMS analysis showed peaks of _m/z_ 298 (70) and 133 (40) resulting from Retro Diels-Alder (RDA) fragmentations. From moiety A wherein bonds 1 and 3 undergo scission, lead to formation of ions I and II as well as scission of bonds 0 and 2 led to the formation of fragment _m/z_ 433 (30). The fragment _m/z_ 298 (70), was generated by both RDA suffered by moiety A and moiety B (Figure 2). Additional fragments observed in the mass spectra are in accordance with those reported for kaempfero1.16 These data, combined with HPLC analysis, which showed a lower retention time for compound **1** (5.7 min) when compared to monomeric flavonoid diglycosides **2** (9.8 min) and **3** (13.8 min.) (Figure 3), confirmed the proposed structure for compound **1** as kaempfero1 _3_-_O_-_b_-rutinosyl-(7\\(a\\) -\n\n## Page 3\n\npyranosyl-(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside (**4**), quercetin-3_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 6)-b-D-galactopyranoside (**5**), 6-hydroxy-rutin (**6**), kaempferol-3_O_-D_-galactopyranoside (**7**), kaempferol-3_O_-D-glucopyranoside (**8**) and kaempferol-3_O_-a_-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 6)-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 4)-b-D glucopyranoside (**9**), catechin (**10**) and catechin-(4\\(a\\) - 8)-catechin (procyanidin B-3) (**11**).

These results indicate that the free-radical scavenging activity of these\n\nFigure 2.: Selected fragment ions from compound **1** by ESIMS.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\nmicromolecules is due to its hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the ease of stabilization of the phenoxyl radical after reduction of DPPH and is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by the IC50 values for compounds **2, 5, 6, 10**, and **11**.24\n\nIt is also evident from Table 2, that _ortho_-dihydroxy moiety plays more important role for this type of activity than the \\(a\\),_b_-unsaturated carbonyl, as the lack of the latter, e.g. in compound **10**, contributed in a lesser extent to the loss of activity, as observed for compounds **3**, **4** and **7-9**, due to the missing catechol group.

NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 degC and referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance (CD3OD at d 3.33 and 49.0 for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR-Nicolet, model EMACT-40 Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer, in the range 500-4000 cm-1. ESIMS spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10-20 eV with argon. Silica gel 60H (230-400 _m_), (60-230 _m_) (Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) and XAD-16 (Sigma) were used in column chromatography. TLC plates were illuminated under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. For preparative HPLC, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, ODS Phenomenex,, Luna column (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 _m_m), and pre-Column (50 x 10.00 mm) were used in this study. For semi-preparative HPLC, a Supelco ODS column 8 (250 mm x 10 mm x 5 _m_m) was used. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All EIMS spectra were obtained by direct insertion of the samples, using an electric cone potential of +70 eV.\n\n### Plant material\n\nLeaves from _C. turbinata_ DC Rodr. were collected at the Viro Reserve, in the State of Para, in October 1996 and February 2000. Dr. Ines Cordeiro identified the specimen, and a voucher No. Cord-2367 was deposited in the Herbarium of the Sao Paulo Botanic Garden, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\n_C. turbinata_ were collected twice, and the plant material obtained (1.0 kg), were dried, powdered and extracted with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) and EtOH, successively, affording extracts A and B, respectively, after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. Extract B was dissolved in MeOH:H2O (80:20) and partitioned with hexane. The hydroalcoholic fraction was partially evaporated to MeOH:H2O (60:40), and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOHAc, and _n_-BuOH. All fractions were preliminarily screened with b-carotene solution on TLC for antioxidant compounds. The EtOHAc fraction (1.0 g after solvent evaporation) was dissolved in MeOH (5.0 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-1 to A-12.

Fraction A-6-I (25.0 mg) was purified by LC over polivinylpirrolidone (PVPP)25 eluted with MeOH affording the new compound **1** (2.6 mg).\n\nLeaves of _C. turbinata_ (powdered and air-dried material 1.2 kg) obtained from the second collection were extracted exhaustively with EtOH at room temperature. The EtOH solutions were evaporated under vacuum to give a residue (57.1 g). This residue was dissolved in EtOH:H2O (90:10), and then extracted with _n_-hexane to give a _n_-hexane fraction (28.9 g). The EtOH:H2O fraction was extracted with CH2Cl2, EtOAc and _n_-BuOH successively, to give a CH2Cl2 fraction (4.0 g), EtOAc fraction (4.1 g), _n_-BuOH fraction (12.4 g) and H2O-soluble residues (7.6 g), respectively, which were screened by b-carotene test on TLC.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} Compounds & IC50 (_μ_mol L−1)a \\\\\n**2** & 21.3 ± 0.1 \\\\\n**3** & 62.3 ± 0.3 \\\\\n**4** & 59.4 ± 0.3 \\\\\n**5** & 30.1 ± 0.2 \\\\\n**6** & 25.4 ± 0.2 \\\\\n**7** & 63.2 ± 0.4 \\\\\n**8** & 63.1 ± 0.6 \\\\\n**9** & 61.9 ± 0.5 \\\\\n**10** & 33.4 ± 0.1 \\\\\n**11** & 11.5 ± 0.1 \\\\ BHT & 80.1\n\n## Page 6\n\nThe EtOAc (4.1 g) underwent to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 25 fractions (A-1 to A-25).

The persisting yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.17\n\n#### Determination of the radical scavenging activity\n\n1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was used in methanol (100 _m_mol L-1). 2. 0 mL of the reagent was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds, previously dissolved in methanol, with yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 and 5 _m_mol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and maintained for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin and BHT were used as standard compounds. DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in methanol (1.0 mL) served as control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer at 517 nm and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH treated control group.\n\nChimarrhoside (**1**).

O dittimo foi anteriormente isolado dos caules, porren sua configuracao relativa nao foi resolvida por experimentos de RMx. Este trabaho apresenta a analise de difracao de raios-X da epoxi-fraxinelona, descreve o isolamento da fraxinelonona e fraxinelona pela primeira vez em _Raulinoa_, e a atividade toxica da primeira sobre formigas cortadeiras (_Atta sexdens rubropilosa_). Pouca atividade foi observada para o limonode degradado testado; entretanto, o limonoide acido limonexico isolado dos caules, apresentou alta toxicidade contra as formigas cortadeiras, reduzindo consideravelmente a longevidade das mesmas, em comparacao com o controle.\n\nPhytochemical survey of roots extracts of the South Brazilian endemic plant _Raulinoa echinata_ Cowan, Rutaceae led to the isolation of known degraded limonoids: fraxinellone, fraxinellone and epoxy-fraxinellone. The latter was previously isolated also from the stems, but the relative configuration could not be solved by NMR experiments. This paper deals with the X-ray diffraction analysis of epoxy-fraxinellone and its toxicity to leaf-cutting ants, describes the isolation of fraxinellonone and fraxinellone for the first time in _Raulinoa_. Epoxy-fraxinellone showed no toxicity to the leaf-cutting ants (_Atta sexdens rubropilosa_). The limonoid limonexic acid, isolated from stems, presented high toxicity to the leaf-cutting ants, diminishing considerably their longevity.\n\n**Keywords:**_Raulina echinata_, degraded limonoids, limonexic acid, _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_, X-ray structure\n\n## Introduction\n\n_Raulinoa_ is a monospecific genus and the species _Raulinoa echinata_ Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic in the Itajai Valley, SC, Brazil.1 This endangered perennial woody shrub is characterized by the presence of spines (popularly know as Cutia-de-espinho) and has only been found in a short interval (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks of Itajai river in an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing a high degree of adaptation to the environment.\n\nFootnote 1: e-mail: maique@univali.br\n\nWe have previously reported the isolation and biological activities of some compounds of _R. echinata.2_ In continuation of our search for compounds and natural products to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants, we have investigated the hexane extracts of roots of _R. echinata_ leading to the isolation of typical rutaceous degraded limonoids: fraxinellone (**1**), fraxinellonone (**2**) and new epoxy-fraxinellone (**3**). The extracts of the stems furnished the known limonin precursor, limonexic acid (**4**).\n\nFootnote 2: e-mail: maique@univali.br\n\nLeaf-cutting ants are one of the most serious agricultural pests in South American countries and the biological control of these insects has been the aim of many studies. Their control can be achieved by means of intoxicating the leaf-cutting ants3 or inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus.\n\nIn this paper we describe the isolation, structural determination and evaluation of the activity of degraded \n\n## Page 2\n\nlimonoids and limonoids as toxicants to the leaf-cutting ants _Atta sexdens rubropilosa_.\n\n## Experimental\n\n### General experimental procedures\n\nNMR spectra: a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C was used.2 All spectra were run in CDCl3 using TMS as internal standard.\n\n### Single crystal X-ray analysis\n\nLow temperature X-ray diffraction data collection was performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoK_a_ radiation (0.71073 A). Data were collected up to 52.7deg in 2th, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the _COLLECT_ program;4 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.5 No absorption corrections were applied.\n\nThe structure was solved by direct methods with _SHELXS-97_.6 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with _SHELXL-97_.7 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. Data collections and experimental details for the complexes are summarized in Table 1. The programs SHELXL-97,7 and ORTEP-38 were used within WinGX9 to prepare materials for publication. Data collections and experimental details for compound **3** are summarized in Table 1.\n\n### Plant material\n\nRoots of _R. echinata_ were collected in Ressacada, Ibirama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade de Sao Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited at the Herbario Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajai, Santa Catarina, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of compounds\n\nThe dried and powdered roots (397 g) were extracted with hexane (4 g) and MeOH (20 g). Successively, the hexane extract was fractionated over silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) into three fractions: hexane, EtOAc and MeOH. The hexane sub-fraction (576 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2C12-EtOAc (9:1 and gradient) to furnish the compounds (in eluting order): fraxinellone (**1**) (37.1 mg), epoxy-fraxinellone (**3**) (76 mg), and the fraction named E (30 mg), that waschromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (99:1 and gradient) to afford fraxinellonone (**2**) (6 mg).\n\nThe methanol extract of the stems (80 g) was partitioned with dichloromethane (yielding 9 g) then chromatographed over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using as eluent hexane-acetone (9:1 and gradient), furnishing 17 sub-fractions (A-P). Sub-fractions D-G (4.1 g) were grouped and chromatographed over silica gel and hexane-acetone (9:1 and gradient) as eluent, originating sub-fractions A-T. The sub-fraction T (1.2 g) was purified by preparative TLC using hexane-benzene (1:1), yielding 650 mg of limonexic acid (**4**).\n\n### Identification of the isolated compounds\n\nThe isolated degraded limonoids fraxinellone10,11,12 (**1**), fraxinellonone10,11,12 (**2**), epoxy-fraxinellone13 (**3**) and limonexic acid13 (**4**) presented spectral data in agreement with the literature.\n\n_epoxy-fraxinellone_ (**3**). 5-Furan-3-yl-1a,4a-dimethyl-hexahydro-1,6-dioxa-cyclodextrin[d]inden-7-one, [a]D -22.5deg (_c_ 0.02, CH2Cl2). Colorless needles, mp 80-82 degC. Crystallographic data: publication no. CCDC 265853\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n#### Atta sexdens bioassay\n\nThe toxicity of the compounds to _Atta sexdens_\\(rubropilosa\\) was determined by ingestion bioassay, according to established protocol described in Bueno _et al._ (1997).14\n\nEach treatment consisted of 50 ants distributed in 5 Petri dishes. The leaf-cutting ants were isolated from their nest and fed with an artificial diet. The ants from the treatment received a diet added with epoxy-fraxinellone or limonexic acid, at a concentration of 200 _m_g. The ants from the control treatment were fed with a diet without this compound.\n\nDuring 25 days, the number of dead ants for each Petri dish was counted and a new portion of artificial diet given. It was estimated the survival curve of leaf-cutting ants of each treatment and calculated the median longevity. The test used for the statistic analyze of data was the Log rank-test (_a_=0.05).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe isolated degraded limonoids **1-3** were respectively identified as fraxinellone (**1**), fraxinellonone (**2**), epoxy-fraxinellone (**3**) and limonexic acid (**4**) by comparison with the spectral data described in the literature.10-13\n\nEpoxy-fraxinellone has a quaternary epoxy group attached to C8-C14, instead of the double bond as in fraxinellone. The spectroscopic data published13 could not furnish clear evidence of the spatial configuration of this moiety. In an attempt to confirm the epoxy group position, nOe difference experiments were performed, but the defining signals were superimposed (in _d_-chloroform and benzene-_d__b_), frustrating clear conclusions. In order to solve these indistinguishable findings, an X-ray analysis (Figure 1) was performed to confirm the epoxy group position.\n\nSingle crystal of epoxy-fraxinellone was produced by recrystallization followed by a crystal-growing process. The recrystallization involved dissolution of the material in proper amount of ethyl acetate-acetone followed by drops of water. Suitable crystals were selected and analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction which established undoubtedly the structure of the compound **3**. Figure 1 shows an _Ortep_8 type view of **3** showing the thermal ellipsoids and atoms labels. This study shows that the molecular conformation of **3** is fixed by the presence of three main intramolecular interactions (Table 2).

As the parent limonoids, some of them have been tested for biological activities including antifeeding and growth regulating activities against insects, and some relationship between the structures and biological activity has been studied.[11]\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} D-H....A & D-H & D.....A & H.....A & D-H.......A \\\\ \\hline Intramolecular interactions & & & & \\\\ C8-H8A...O2 & 1.03(2) & 2.909(2) & 2.66(2) & 93(1) \\\\ C14-H14B...O2 & 0.99(2) & 2.980(2) & 2.74(2) & 94(1) \\\\ C11-H11B...O3 & 0.98(2) & 3.246(2) & 2.50(2) & 131(1) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Intramolecular and intermolecular interactions geometry (Å,\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) of compound **3**\n\nFigure 1: _ORTP_**-3** view of the asymmetric unit of 3, showing the atoms labelling and the 50% probability ellipsoids.\n\nFigure 3: Survival curve of leaf-cutting ants for treatment and control, calculated the median longevity.

Pinto\n\n# Abstract\n\nSix triterpenes and eight limonoids were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit the growth of three human tumour cell lines, breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5). The mechanisms involved in the observed cell growth arrest of the four most potent compounds were carried out by studying their effect in cell cycle profile and programmed cell death. The results showed that one triterpene (odoratol) and two limonoids (geduin and cedrelone) caused cell cycle arrest while only the limonoids geduin and cedrelone were found to be very potent inducers of apoptosis.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nCancer represents one of the most severe health problems worldwide and the development of new anticancer drugs and more effective treatment strategies are fields of utmost importance in drug discovery and clinical therapy. Based on significant advances in cancer biology, much of the research in these areas is currently focused on cancer-specific mechanisms and the corresponding molecular targets [1].\n\nNatural products have been the major sources of chemical diversity driving pharmaceutical discovery over the past century. Many natural products and synthetically modified natural product derivatives have been successfully developed for clinical use to treat human diseases in almost all therapeutic areas [2]. In fact, plant-derived compounds have played an important role in treatment of cancers, and some of the most promising and effective drugs have come up from plant sources like taxol8, camptothecin, combrestatin, vinblastine and vincristine. These drugs have also been the major source of new drug candidates for cancer chemotherapy [3]. Apart from these, many other plant-derived compounds are now in clinical trials as anticancer agents.\n\nOne of the most interesting groups of plant natural products is the triterpeneoid group. Over the past decade, coming to the foreground of interest due to their diverse biological effects are a large group of cyclic triterpenoid-like substances which comprise more than 4000 different identified compounds so far. Triterpenoids are studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, hepatoprotective, analgesic, antimicrobial, antimicotic, virostatic, immunomodulatory and tonic effects. They are used in prevention and treatment of hepatitis, parasitic and protozoal infection and above all, for their cytotoxic effects [4].\n\nFrom a biological point of view, most important triterpeneoid structures are oleanane, ursane, lupane and dammarane triterpenoids. However, in what concerns the anticancer effects, not many triterpeneoid compounds have been so far studied. Among these, the lupane triterpene betulinic acid and the ursane triterpenes boswellic acid and ursolic acid have been exhaustively studied for their anti-cancer effects.\n\nBetulinic acid, which belongs to the lupane group, has been investigated intensively for its anticancer activity. Betulinic acid was found to exhibit the cytotoxic effects against human melanoma cell lines MEL-1, 2 and 4 having the IC50 ranging from 0.5-1.6 mg/ml and dose dependent fragmentation of DNA with induction of apoptosis occurred 24 hours after administration [5]. Cytotoxic effects of betulinic acid were also found in other cell lines including ovarian A2780, OVCAR-5, GROV-1, large cell lung cancer NCI-H460, epidermoid carcinoma A431, melanoma Me665/2/21, Me665/260, small cell lung cancer POGB and POGB/DX doxorubicin resistant with the IC50 values ranging from 1.5-4.5 mg/ml. However, it showed lower toxicity to non-tumor cell lines such as HDFC (normal dermal fibroblasts, IC50 = 10.2 +- 1.5 mg/ml) and PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes, IC50 = 50 mg/ml), in comparison with doxorubicin (HDFC, IC50 = 0.38 mg/ml; PBL, IC50 = 0.02 mg/ml). Interestingly, betulinic acid was markedly more effective than cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and radiation on the primary cancer cells isolated from glioblastoma multiforme [6]. It was demonstrated also that one of the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid and its derivatives was apoptosis induction which was mediated by increasing permeability of the mitochondrial membrane which disturbs the transmembrane potential, causing the release of cytochrome-_c_ and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), with the resulting activation of caspases 3 and 8. Subsequent cleavage of the substrates and nuclear fragmentation thus occurred [7]. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL proteins suppresses activation of caspases and other markers of apoptosis of neuroectodermal origin [8]. Furthermore, betulinic acid was found to exert its cytotoxic effect against human glioma cell lines\n\n## Page 2\n\n(LN-229, U87, MG, T98G, LN-18 and LN-308) and an increased level of the proapoptotic protein Bax was observed 24 hours after treatment with butulinic acid. The induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for activation of caspase 3, also occurred [9]. On the other hand, clones of these cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl-2, showed reduced ROS without activation of betulinic acid induced apoptosis. These findings were in accordance with the fact that the antiapoptotic properties of Bcl-2 are connected with antioxidative defence mechanisms. This underlines the importance of producing ROS in the induction of apoptosis by betulinic acid. Betulinic acid is also an inhibitor of the enzyme aminopeptidase N which takes part in the angioproliferative and metastatic activity of tumors. From a clinical perspective, it is interesting to point out that betulinic acid exhibits its greater effect in an environment with a pH lower than 6.8, which is the case for the majority of tumors [10]. Tellingly, in contrast to non-cancer cells, cancer cells subjected to hypothermia showed increased sensitivity to betulinic acid [11].\n\nFor the ursane group, boswellic acid and its derivatives were found to be cytotoxic to glioma cell lines [12]. In animal model, depending on dose, they caused an increased passage of cells to apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival after implantation of cell lines of malignant glioma C6 [13]. Derivatives of boswellic acid were found to induce differentiation in leukemic cell lines in low concentrations and in high concentrations they led to apoptosis [14]. The antiproliferative effects of these derivatives are connected to their ability to inhibit both topoisomerase I and IIa, whose activity is critical for the proliferation of cancer cells. Acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid (AKBA), originally isolated from _Boswellia serrata_, was found to inhibit constitutive STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription-3) in human multiple myeloma cells [15]. Activation of STAT3 has been linked with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and angiogenesis of tumor cells, including human multiple myeloma. Thus, agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential as cancer therapeutics. Lipophilicity of boswellic acid derivatives allows them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and thus renders them the potential for use in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS. Concerning this, they were found to show higher inhibitory effects against glioma cells than those of the clinically used anticancer agents camptothecins [16] and etoposide [12]. Furthermore, derivatives of boswellic acid are shown to be suitable for palliative treatment of progressive or relapsing brain tumors, due to, among other things, their anti-edematous properties [17]. Another interesting member of the ursane group is involic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid in higher plants. This compound was found to show inhibitory activity against mammalian DNA polymerases \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and human DNA topoisomerases I and II. It also inhibits bovine DNA polymerase \\(a\\), rat polymerase \\(b\\), HIV reverse transcriptase. It was also found to lower transcription of COX-2 by inhibition of the signal pathways PKC and AP-1. As the expression of PKC and AP-1 is elevated in a number of tumors, thus targeting these molecules is one of the aims of antiproliferative therapy [18].\n\nOne of the most important members of the oleanane group is oleanolic acid which is present in high concentration in the ginseng root and it showed a range of antitumor effects. Oleanolic acid was shown to induce differentiation in the teratocarcinoma cell line F9 [19]. Furthermore, it was found to exhibit also antimutagenic and antiangiogenic activities [20, 21]. In addition, it also stimulates the release of NO and TNF-a, including induction of iNOS activity and TNF-a expression in macrophages. This effect is mediated by its ability to activate DNA binding to the transcription complex NF-kB and thereby its activation. Maslinic acid, another oleanane triterpenoid which is present in high concentrations in the protective wax-like coating of olives, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of HT29 colon cancer cells [22]. Treatment with maslinic acid resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death in colon-cancer cells. Mechanism study has revealed that maslinic acid inhibited considerably the expression of Bcl-2 whilst increasing that of Bax. It also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-_c_ and activated caspases 9 and 3. Finally, for the damamarane group, fomilletic acids A and B, the secondary metabolites of basidomycete _Fomillea frazinea_, were shown to inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and human DNA topoisomerase I and II. It exhibited also cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines NUGC-3, and PC-12 where differentiation was observed with subcytotoxic concentrations [23].\n\nIn the course of our research program on isolation, synthesis and evaluation of anticancer activity of plant natural products, we have evaluated the capacity of two dammarane type triterpenes (**1** and **2**), four triucallane type triterpenes (**3-6**, Fig. **1**) and eight \n\n## Page 3\n\nlimonoids (**7**-**14**, Fig. **2**) to inhibit the _in vitro_ growth of three human tumor cell lines namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small cell lung cancer (NC1-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5). Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the four most active compounds was also investigated for their effects on the cell cycle profile and the programmed cell death of the NCI-H460 cells.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### General Experimental\n\n1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, at ambient temperature on a Bruker ARX 400 instrument operating at 400 and 80 MHz, respectively. The Shimadzu LC-6AD model HPLC equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-6AV UV detector (240 and 215 nm) and a Biodex Asahiba GS-310 2Ga column (400 x 25 mm, 5mm particle size) was used. For column chromatography, Silica gel 60 (Acros organics) and Sephadex LH 20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB) were used. Solvents were from Synt and reagents were from SIGMA, unless otherwise stated.\n\n### Extraction and Isolation of the Compounds\n\n_Isolation of Cabraleadiol (1) and Octillone (2)_\n\nFruits of _Cabralea canjerana_ (Vell.) Mart. was collected in Federal University of Viosa, MG, Brazil. The plant material was identified by T.D. Pennington of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (UK). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de Engenaharia Flowerstal, Dendrologia of the Federal University of Viosa.\n\nAfter removing seeds, dried fruits (460g) were ground and extracted with ethanol (3 x 500 mL), at room temperature and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 88 g of a concentrated ethanolic extract which was dissolved in 400 ml of a 3:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O. The aqueous methanolic solution was partitioned successively with hexane (2x300 ml), CH2Cl2 (2x300 ml) and E6OAc (2x300 ml) to furnish hexane (47.4 g), dichloromethane (5.4 g) and ethyl acetate (4.4 g) fractions. The hexane fraction was applied over a silica gel column (250 g) and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, eight 700 ml fractions were collected as follows: fr 1 (hexane), fr 2 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 1:1); fr 3 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 3:7); Fr 4 (hexane), fr 5 (CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 1:1); fr 6 (EtOAc), fr 7 (EtOAc-MeOH, 1:1); fr 8 (McOH), Fr. 2 (120 mg) was placed on a gel permeation column of Sephadex LH-20 (50 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of MeOH-CH2Cl2 to afford three 250 ml subfractions. Subfr 2 (88.6 mg) was chromatograph on a silica gel column (15 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of hexane-Me2CO to give five 100 ml fractions. Frs 3 and 4, after evaporation of the solvent by reduced pressure, afforded, respectively, 24.4 mg of cabraleadiol (**1**) and 16.3 mg of ocotillone (**2**) whose structures were established by 1H and 13C NMR as well as comparison of their spectral and physical data with those reported in the literature [24, 25].\n\n### Isolation of 7-Deacetoxy-7-Oxogedunin (7) and 6-Acetoxygedunin (10)\n\nFruits of _Carpa guianensis_ Aubl. were purchased from the city of Belem (Para State, Brazil). Dried and ground fruit arid (160g) was extracted with MeOH (3 x 500 ml) at room temp. The methadonic solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 40 g of the crude methanol extract which was dissolved in 150 ml of a 4:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O and then partitioned with hexane (3x 150 ml) and EtoAc (3x 150 ml) to give, respectively 23 g and 15 g of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. The ethyl acetate extract was\n\nFig. **(2)**: Structure of limonoids (**7**-**14**) evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\napplied to a flash column chromatography of silica gel (200 g) and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-Me2CO -MeOH gradient, and 50 ml fractions were collected as follows: frs 1-2 (hexane), frs 3-6 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 7.3), frs 7-18 (hexane-CH2Cl2, 1:1), frs 18-21 (CH2Cl2, frs 22-23 (CH2Cl2, 7.3), fr 24 (CH2Cl2-Me2CO, 1:4), frs 25 (150 ml, MeOH). Purification of fr 8 by isocitrate HPLC, using a mixture of MeOH/CH2Cl2 (7:3) as solvent and a UV detection at 254 nm, yielded 32.1 mg of 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (**7**) and 55.8 mg of 6-acetoxygedunin (**10**) whose structures were established by comparison of their 1H and 1NNMR data with those reported in the literature [26].\n\n### Preparation of Acetonide of Odoradol (5)\n\nOdoradol (4, 25 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of acetone and one drop of conc.H2SO4 was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, under N2 atmosphere, for 3 h after which the solution was evaporated and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was washed with H2O to remove H2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent gave 15 mg of acetonide of odoratol (**5**).\n\nIsolations of the triucnaline triterpenes odoratone (**3**), odoratol (**4**), 22-hydroxytrinculan-7, 24-diene-2,3-diene (**6**) and the limonoids gedunin (**8**) and 7-deacetoxyedunin (**9**) from _Cedrela odorata_ grafted on _Toona clata_ var. _anstrulis_ have been described previously by de Paula _et al._[27, 28]. Isolation and characterization of the limonoids 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazadirone (**11**), credclone (**12**), toonacilin (**13**) from _Toona clilata_ were described by Neto _et al._[29, 30] while isolation of guyanin (**14**) from _Hortia oreadica_, was reported by Severino _et al._[31].\n\n### Biological Activity\n\n#### Reagents\n\nRPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were from Gibco Invitrogen Co. (Scotland, UK). Acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), penicillin, streptomycin, sulforhodamine B (SRB) and trypan blue were from Sigma Chemical Co (Saint Louis, USA). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Tris were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).\n\n#### Solutions of Compounds\n\nStock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and kept at -20 degC. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were freshly prepared just prior to each assay.\n\n#### Cell Lines\n\nThree human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma, ECACC), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, a kind gift from NCI, Bethesda, USA) and A375-C5 (melanoma, ECACC) were grown as a monolayer and routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin), at 37 degC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n\n### Tumour Cell Growth Assay\n\nThe effect of the compounds on the growth of the described human tumour cell lines was evaluated according to the procedure adopted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) in the \"_In vitro_ Anticancer Drug Discovery Screen\", which uses the protein-binding dye SRB to assess cell growth [32, 33]. The plating density of each cell line was 1.5 x 105 cells/ml for MCF-7, and 7.5 x 105 cells/ml for NCI-H460 and A375-C5. Cells were allowed to attach overnight in 96-well plates and were then exposed for 48 h to five serial concentrations of the compounds, starting from a maximum concentration of 150 mM (final concentration). At the end of this incubation period the adherent cells were fixed _in situ_ with 10% TCA (final concentration), washed with distilled water and stained with 0.4% SRB (solubilised in 1% acetic acid). The bound stain was solubilised in 10 mM Tris and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (EAR400 STL-Labinstruments). For each test compound and for each cell line a dose-response curve was made and the value of GI50, corresponding to the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the net cell growth, was calculated as described elsewhere [33]. Doxorubicin, used as a positive control, was tested in the same manner.\n\n### Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile and Levels of Apoptosis in the NCI-H460 Cell Line\n\nThe compounds with GI50 bellow (or similar to) 10 mM were selected for further analysis of their effect on cell cycle profile and apoptosis. These assays were carried out in the NCI-H460 cells, since they were one of the most sensitive cells to these compounds. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7.5x104 cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degC for 24 h, in order to adhere. Cells were then incubated for 48 h with complete medium (control), the compounds solvent (DMSO) or with the compounds at their respective GI50 concentrations (determined by the SRB assay). Cells were then harvested and further processed for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection.\n\nFor cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 5 mg/ml propidium iodide. Cellular DNA content (for cell cycle analysis and presence of sub-G1 peak) was then analyzed as previously described [34], using an Epics XL-MCL Coulter flow cytometer, plotting at least 20,000 events per sample.\n\nApoptosis was analyzed using the Human Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis Kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of phosphatidylserine externalization was processed using a flow cytometer plotting at least 20,000 events per sample (as above).\n\nBoth cell cycle distribution and apoptosis data were analyzed using the FlowJo 7.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). At least three independent experiments were carried out and results are presented as the average and standard error (SEM) of those experiments.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSix triterpenes (Fig. **1**) and eight limonoids (Fig. **2**) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the _in vitro_ growth of three human tumour cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5), using the protein-binding dye suflorhodamine B (SRB) method and their growth inhibitory effect, expressed as GI50 (mM), is shown in Table **1**.\n\nFollowing a continuous exposure for 48 h, all six triterpenes (**1-6**) and only four limonoids (**8**, **11**, **12**, **13**) were found to be active against all three tumour cell lines whereas the other four limonoids (**7**, **9**, **10** and **14**) were inactive (Table **1**). The triucnaline triterpene odoradol (**4**) and the limonoids gedunin (**8**), 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b -epoxyazadirone (**11**) and cedrelone (**12**) showed strong cell growth inhibitory activity, presenting their GI50 values below 12 mM for all three cell lines. Interestingly, the limonoid cedrelone (**12**) was found to be not only the most active growth inhibitor but also more selective on NCI-H460 (GI50 = 2.77 +- 0.07 μM) and A375-C5 (GI50 = 2.60 +- 0.21 μM) cell lines when compared to odoradol (**4**), gedunin (**8**) and 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazadirone (**11**). While the damamame calabreadiol (**1**) showed moderate activity in all three cell lines (GI50~30 μM), the triucnaline triterpenes odoratone (**3**) and 22-hydroxytrinculanalla-7,24-diene-2,3-diene (**6**) showed moderate growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but strong activity against A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, the damamare triterpene cocillone (**2**) showed only weak inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but moderate activity against A375-C5 cells whereas the limonoid toonacillin (**13**) showed weak inhibitory activity against all three cell lines. Though carbaleaediol (**1**) and cocoillone (**2**) are both 20, 24 - epoxydamame, they differ only in the stereochemistry of C-24 and the functional group on C-3. With the C-24\\(S\\) configuration and the hydroxyl \n\n## Page 5\n\ngroup on C-3, cabraleadiol (**1**) exhibited _ca._ three times higher in growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells than that of octillone (**2**) which has a ketone function on C-3 and the opposite configuration of C-24. However, the growth inhibitory effects on the A375-C5 cells are similar for both compounds. In fact, cabraleadiol (**1**), isolated from various plant sources, has been previously tested for its cytotoxicity against various tumour cell lines. Phongmayrkin _et al._ [35] reported a weak cytotoxic effect of this compound, isolated from _Chisocheton penduliflorus_ (Meliaceae), on a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Qiu _et al._ [24] have found no cytotoxic effect of cabraleadiol (**1**), isolated from _Aglaia lawii_, on the LNCaP, Col 2 and KB cancer cell lines. On the other hand, octillone (**2**), isolated from _Bentala plaphylla var. japonicum_, was evaluated against a variety of human cancer cell lines, and was found to show no cytotoxicity against the KB (human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx), K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and COLO205 (colon carcinoma) cell lines. Interestingly, though (**2**) did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against KB-C2 (ocochine-resistant KB) cells (IC50 values >100 nM), it was found to show moderate cytotoxic activity (with IC50 ranging from 20.6 to 64.2 mM) in the presence of 2.5 mM colchicine. The enhanced cytotoxicity of octillone (**2**) against KB-C2 cells in the presence of 2.5 mM colchicine as compared with that in the absence of colchicine, suggesting that this triterpene might show some MDR-reversing effects [25]. For the trivellanae triterpenes, odorad (**4**) was the most active analogue exhibiting GI50 values in the rank of 10 mM. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 of odoratol (**4**) by a ketone group in odoratome (**3**) caused a two fold decrease of the growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cell lines; however this structural alteration did not affect the growth inhibitory activity against the A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, transforming the _vic_ diol functionality on the furan ring of odoratol (**4**) into its acetonide (**5**) led to a loss of activity.\n\nConcerning the limonoids, the most active analogue was cedredone (**12**), exhibiting GI50 values below 5 mM in all three cell lines. Although the capacity of cedrelone (**12**) to inhibit the _in vitro_ growth of human tumour cells have not been previously reported, this compound is known to demonstrate several other activities including insecticide [36], antifeedant [37] and antifungal activity [38]. Although its growth inhibitory effect was _ca._ two folds less than that of cedrelone, the structurally related limonoid 6a-acetoxy-14b,15p-epoxyazadironne (**11**) also exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three cancer cell lines. Interestingly, Maneerat _et al._ [39] have found that 6a-acetoxyepoxyazadione, isolated from _Chisocheton siamsis_ and which differs from **11** only in the presence of the carbonyl group on C-16 of the former, was inactive against oral human epidermal carcinoma (KB), small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Among the limonoids whose structure possessing the lactone moiety on the ring D, sedunin (**8**) was the only member which exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three human tumour cell lines (GI50 <= 10 mM); however 7-deacetylgedunin (**9**) was inactive. Interestingly, Brandt _et al._ [40] have evaluated, among several analogues, gedunin (**8**) and 7-deacetylgedunin (**9**), obtained from necem oils, for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cell lines. While godun (**8**) was found to exhibit strong antiproliferative activity against both cell lines (IC50 = 8.84 +- 0.03 for MCF-7 and 3.22 +- 0.6 for SKBr3), 7-deacetylgedunin (**9**) showed only moderate activity (IC50 = 28.96 +- 4.48 for MCF-7 and 21.09 +- 5.95 for SKBr3). Godunin (**8**) was also shown to manifest anticancer activity _via_ inhibition of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) folding machinery [41] and to induce the degradation of Hsp90-dependent client proteins similar to other Hsp90 inhibitors [42].\n\nIn order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the most active compounds, they were assayed for their effect on the cell cycle profile of the NCI-H460 cells. Thus, NCI-H460 cells were treated with odoratol (**4**), gedunin (**8**), 6a-acetoxy-14b,15p-epoxyazadironne (**11**) and cedrelone (**12**) at their respective GI50 concentrations (values of GI50 for NCI-H460 from Table **1**) for 48 h and processed for cell cycle analysis. Results (Fig. **3**) show that the majority of the compounds tested (with the exception of **11**) affected the normal cell cycle distribution of the NCI-H460 cells. Odoratol (**4**) was found to induce a cell cycle ar \n\n## Page 6\n\nrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% cells in this phase upon DMSO treatment to 70% of cells following treatment with this compound), causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 13%) and G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 11%) phases of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with sodium (**8**), the cell cycle progression was blocked (arrested) in the S phase (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 60%), leading to a decrease in the % of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). Incubation with credclone (**12**) caused an accumulation of cells (arrest) in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 40%) and the G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 43%) phases of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the % of cells in G1 (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). In addition, there were indications that odoratol (**4**), gedunin (**8**) and credclone (**12**) induced apoptosis because of the increase in the sub-G1 population of cells when compared to control. Therefore, a specific apoptosis assay was carried out.\n\nIndeed, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was performed to determine the % of cells in early and late apoptosis (and necrosis) by flow cytometry, following treatment of NCI-H460 cells with the selected compounds. Results showed that for all tested compounds, but very modestly for odoratol (**4**) and 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**), the % of cells in early (annexin V positive, PI negative) or late apoptosis (annexin V-positive, PI positive) were increased upon treatment of cells with the GI90 concentration of the compounds (Table **2**). Gedunin (**8**) caused an increase in cell death from approximately 12.6% in controls for 11.2% in DMSO control) to 47.2% in cells treated for 48 h with the GI50 concentration of this compound. Indeed, credclone (**12**) was particularly effective in inducing programmed cell death, causing 80.3% of cell death upon 48 h treatment of the cells with its GI50 concentration. It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the observed apoptotic inducing effects, particularly the effects on caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be investigated, by analyzing the levels of Bax and other apoptosis related proteins, such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. This would be possible by analyzing extracts of cells treated with the compounds (with or without caspase inhibitors) for the levels of apoptosis associated proteins, by Western Blot with appropriate antibodies, as has been carried out by others for example in order to study the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by lupeol [43].\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nSix triterpenes (two dammaranes and four triucallanes) and eight limonoids, isolated from the members of the families Meliaceae and Rutaceae, were evaluated by the SRB method for their cytotoxic effect against three human tumour cell lines. The triucallane triterpene odoratol (**4**) and the limonoids gedunin (**8**), 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**), credclone (**12**) were the most active inhibitors of cell growth (GI50 less than 12 uM). Of these, credclone (**12**) has shown to be the most active growth inhibitor, presenting GI50 values below 4.20 uM in all three tested cell lines.\n\nFrom the analysis of the cell cycle profile in NCI-H460 cells, it was possible to conclude that odoratol (**4**)** arrests cell cycle at the G1 phase, gedunin (**8**) causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase and credclone (**12**) at the S and G2M phases while 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**) did not affect the cell cycle profile of these cells. In addition, analysis of programmed cell death indicates that odoratol (**4**) and 6a-acetoxy-14b,15b-epoxyazidrone (**11**) cause a very small increase in cell death but gedunin (**8**) and particularly credclone (**12**), are very potent inducers of programmed cell death. In conclusion, credclone (**12**) is very potent by causing cell cycle\n\nFig. (3).

As a number of recently studied triterpenoids compare very favourably with drugs in current use [44], it is foreseeable that attention of many research institutions and pharmaceutical companies will be drawn to this class of compounds.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), I&D 4040/2007, FEDER, POCI, Capes/FCT (GRICES) and FAPESP.

(Rutaceae), popularly known as _guaranta, goiabeira_, is a native tree from Brazil. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the ethanol stems extract afforded the isolation of six alkaloids: leiokinine A, leptomerine, kokusaginine, skimmianine, maculine and flindersiamine. All isolated compounds were tested for acetyl cholinesterase inhibition, _in vitro_ and displayed anticholinesterasic activity. The alkaloid leptomerine showed the highest activity (IC\\({}_{50}\\) = 2.5 mM), similar to that of the reference compound galanthamine (IC\\({}_{50}\\) = 1.7 mM). The results showed for the first time the presence of alkaloids leptomerine and skimmianine in _E. leiocarpa_ (Engl.) with potent anticholinesterasic activity.\n\n_Keywords:Esenbeckia leiocarpa_; Rutaceae; alkaloids; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe genus _Esenbeckia_ comprises 30 species distributed in Tropical America [1]. Chemical studies of _Esenbeckia_ spp. showed that they synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites, particularly quinolinic, quinolonic and indolic alkaloids and furocoumarins, and these compounds were considered chemical markers of this genus [2-4].\n\n_Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ Engl. (Rutaceae), native from Brazil, is an ornamental tree widely distributed in Brazilian Dense Ombrophilis Atlantic Forest from South of Bahia to Sao Paulo states and is commonly known as _guaranta_ (SP), _goioheira_ (BA), _anta-forte_ and _guarataia_ (ES) [5].\n\nPrevious studies on _E. leiocarpa_ have been reported in the literature, and various compounds have been isolated from it, such as the alkaloids kokusaginine, flindersiamine, maculine, dictamnine, 4-methoxy-2-(3'-pentyl)quinoline, 1,4-dihydro-1-methyl-2-(3'-pentyl)quinolin-4-one, leiokinine A and leiokinine B, twelve indole derivatives, three lignans, one coumarin, two amides and the methyl 4-isoprenyloxy-_trans_-cinnamate [3,6,7].\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive cognitive dysfunction that results from a deficiency in cholinergic activity in brain [8]. Several plant-derived drugs (rivastigmine and galanthamine) that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can be used to treat early stages of AD, since these compounds increase the endogenous levels of acetylcholine to boost cholinergic neurotransmission. In a recent review, 260 chemically defined natural molecules were evaluated for acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The compounds tested were classified in alkaloids (139), monoterpenes (27), coumarins (18), triterpenes (17), flavonoids (14), benzenoids (13), diterpenes (8), oxygen heterocycles (5), sesquiterpenes (5), stilbenes (3), lignans (2), sulfur compounds (2), proteids (2), polycyclic (1), quinoid (1), benzoxazinone (1), carotenoid (1) and alycyclic (1) [9-11].\n\nStrong efforts to discover new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from a vast number of plant species were realized in our laboratory. In a screening of 58 extracts from native Brazilian plants, the ethanolic crude extract of the stems of _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ showed a strong acetylcholinesterase inhibition and was chosen for bioassay-guided fractionation in order to isolate the biologically active compounds and evaluate the acetylcholinesterase inhibition of these compounds.\n\n## 2 Results and Discussion\n\n### Effect of crude extract and hexane and alkaloid fractions on acetylcholinesterase inhibition\n\nThe crude ethanol extract of _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ stems inhibited 91.1 +- 0.2% of acetylcholinesterase activity when tested at 200 mg/mL. Acid-base partition was used to separate the crude extract (35.8 g) of _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ into two fractions, hexane and chloroform (Alkaloid) and the yield of each fraction was 0.64% and 3.30%, respectively. The ethanol extract, hexane and alkaloid fractions of _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity with an IC50 50.7 mg/mL, 6.0 mg/mL and 1.6 mg/mL, respectively (Figure 1). The chloroform fraction, with positive result for alkaloids (Dragendorff's and iodoplatinate reagents), exhibited highest level of AChE inhibition and was selected for further purification.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n### Chromatographic profile of alkaloid fraction\n\nThe analytical chromatographic (HPLC) analyses of alkaloid fraction (105.0 mg) from _E. leiocarpa_ afforded 14 fractions from which six major compounds were identified. They were fractionated by chromatographic procedure and the anticholinesterase activity of each fraction was tested by TLC bioassay as described by Marston _et al_. [12]. The fractions 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 presented strong anticholinesterase activity on TLC bioassay (results not showed) and retention times (_t_R) of 9.12 min, 11.69 min, 14.26 min, 15.60 min and 20.73 min, respectively (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 1: Acetylcholinesterase inhibition by ethanol extract, alkaloid and hexane fractions (0.2 to 100.0 μg/mL).\n\nFigure 2: Analytical chromatographic profile of alkaloid fraction from _E. leiocarpa_ by HPLC and their respectives molecular ion peaks [M+H]+ data in the ESI-MS.\n\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n\n\n### Isolation and identification of alkaloids from stems of E. leiocarpa\n\nThe alkaloid fraction of _E. leiocarpa_ (m = 105.0 mg) was dissolved into MeOH (10 mg/mL) and submitted to RP-HPLC using acetonitrile-water-methanol (10:45:45) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 242 nm and flow rate of 8 mL/min, affording 14 fractions (Fractions 1-14). From preparative HPLC, fractions Fr. 7 (_t_R = 15.4 min) and Fr. 9 (_t_R = 19.3 min) were identified as two 4-quinolinone alkaloids, leiokine A (**1**, 5.8 mg) [3] and leptomerine (**2**, 16.0 mg) [13], respectively. Fractions Fr. 10 (_t_R = 24.5 min) and Fr. 11 (_t_R = 26.2 min) yielded two fluoroquinoline alkaloids, kokusaginine (**3**, 5.7 mg) [14] and skimmianine (**4**, 12.3 mg) [15], respectively. In addition, fraction Fr. 12 (_t_R = 34.3 min) afforded a mixture of two others fluoroquinoline alkaloids (3.2 mg), maculine (**5**) [16] and flindersiamine (**6**) [6] (Figure 3). Their identification was based on analysis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as by comparison with literature data, 13C-NMR data of compounds **1**, **2**, **3** and **4** and 1H-NMR data of compounds **5** and **6** (see Experimental section).\n\n### Anticholinesterase activity of alkaloids\n\nThe alkaloids maculine, flindersiamine, kokusaginine, leptomerine, leiokine A and skimmianine identified in this work were previously isolated from other _Esenbeckia_ species [1,17-19]. The alkaloids leptomerine and skimmianine have already been isolated from _Haplophyllum heptomerum_ (Rutaceae) in 1986 [13]. However, this is the first occurrence of leptomerine and skimmianine in _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ (Engl.).\n\nTo date, no study on evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity was performed with species of the genus _Esenbeckia_. In the present paper, the alkaloids isolated from stems of _E. leiocarpa_, leiokine A and skimmianine presented acetylcholinesterase inhibition with IC50 values of 0.21 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. While leptomerine and kokusaginine showed IC50 values of 2.5 mM and 46 mM, respectively (Figure 4). The alkaloids leptomerine and kokusaginine had a potent effect\n\nFigure 3: Chemical structures of alkaloids with anticholinesterase activities, ALK 1 to 6. The alkaloids isolated are: **1** – leiokine A, **2** – leptomerine, **3** – kokusaginine, **4** – skimmianine, **5** – maculine, **6** – flindersiamine.\n\n\n\n## Page 5\n\nanticholinesterase similar to reference compounds galanthamine and physostigmine that have 1.7 mM and 0.4 mM values of IC50, respectively.\n\nPrevious biological studies with chloroform extract from leaves of _E. leiocarpa_ demonstrated weak antifeedant activity against the pink bollworm, _Pectinophora gossypiella,_ this activity was attributed to alkaloids leiokinine A and leiokinine B [3]. On the other hand, the alkaloids isolated from leaves of _E. belizencis_ Lundell were tested in the brine shrimp toxicity assay and revealed that kokusaginine have mildly toxicity (LC50 = 367 ppm) and findersiamine did not showed toxicity (LC50 > 1,000 ppm) [20]. The alkaloids maculine, kokusaginine, skimmianine and findersiamine demonstrated weak mutagenic activity [21,22]. In another species of Rutaceae, _Raulinoa echinata_ Cowan, these same alkaloids showed antifungal activity against _Leucoagaricus gongylophorus_, a symbiotic fungus of leaf-cutting ants [23].\n\n## Experimental\n\n### Plant material\n\nThe stems of _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ Engl. were collected in January 2007 from a specimen cultivated at the \"Cidade Universitaria - Armando Salles de Oliveira- CUASO\", USP, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Jose Rubens Pirani. A voucher specimen (SPF 1169) was deposited at the Herbarium of the Departamento de Botanica, Instituto de Biociencias, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\n\n### Extraction and isolation\n\nThe dry stems of _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_ (1000 g) were powdered and extracted with ethanol (5 x 1.5 L) using a maceration method. The ethanol extract (35.8 g) was re-dissolved in aqueous solution (HCl 0.1 M, 2 x 120 mL) and the insoluble portion was filtered off. The acid solution was partitioned with hexane (7 x 60 mL) yielding a hexane fraction (0.230 g). The acid aqueous fraction was basified with NH4OH (pH 10) and partitioned with CHCl3 (7 x 60 mL) yielding an active alkaloid\n\nFigure 4: Acetylcholinesterase inhibition of physostigmine, galanthamine, leptomerine, kokusaginine, leiokinine A and skimmianine (10−10 to 10−3 M).\n\n\n\n## Page 6\n\nfraction (1.182 g). All the fractions were tested in biological test for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity.\n\n### General methods for compounds identification\n\nThe alkaloid fraction was analyzed in HPLC Varian Pro Star 310 system equipped with a 20 mL injection loop. The column used was a Phenomenex C-18 (250 x 4.6 mm) maintained at 20 degC. Twenty mL of the sample (1 mg/mL) was injected, the mobile phase (1 mL/min) was ACN: MeOH: H2O (10:45:45). Preparative HPLC was carried out using Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 20.0 mm) preparative column. HPLC analysis of alkaloid fraction afforded 14 fractions. Fractions 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were identified by NMR analyses. The 1D - (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, _g_HMQC and _g_HMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using the CDCl3 as an internal standard.\n\n_Leioknine 4_ (**1**). 1H-NMR [CDC13, d (ppm), \\(J\\) (Hz)]: d 2.97 (H-C1'), 1.68 (H-C2'), 1.10 (H-C3'), 8.53 (dd, \\(J\\) = 8.0 and 1.5 Hz, H-C5), 7.36 (tl, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-C6), 7.52 (dl, \\(J\\) = 8.0 Hz, H-C7), 7.65 (dt, \\(J\\) = 8.0 and 1.5 Hz, H-C8), 3.82 (s, H-N-CH3), 3.94 (s, H-C3-OCH3) [3]. 13C-NMR [CDC13]: d 29.48 (C-1'), 22.23 (C-2'), 14.15 (C-3'), 148.45 (C-2), 140.01 (C-3), 172.01 (C-4), 141.07 (C-5), 126.52 (C-6), 123.11 (C-7), 131.70 (C-8), 115.29 (C-9), 126.77 (C-10), 34.93 (N-CH3), 60.22 (3-OCH3) [3].\n\n_Leptomerine_ (**2**). 1H-NMR [CDC13, d (ppm), \\(J\\) (Hz)]: d 1.60 (m, H-C1'), 1.60 (m, H-C2'), 0.85 (t, H-C3'), 6.36 (s, H-C3), 8.41 (dd, H-C5), 7.34 (t, H-C6), 7.52 (d, H-C7), 7.63 (d, H-C8), 3.77 (s, H-N-CH3). 13C-NMR [CDC13]: d 27.6 (C-1'), 27.6 (C-2'), 11.6 (C-3'), 109.0 (C-3), 177.23 (C-4), 142.14 (C-5), 126.57 (C-6), 123.70 (C-7), 132.18 (C-8), 115.9 (C-9), 126.7 (C-10), 34.4 (N-CH3) [13].\n\n_Kokusaginine_ (**3**). 1H-NMR [CDC13, d (ppm), \\(J\\) (Hz)]: d 7.53 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-C2'), 7.02 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-C3'), 7.47 (s, H-C5), 7.40 (s, H-C8), 4.41 (s, H-C4-OCH3), 4.03 (s, H-C6-OCH3), 4.02 (s, H-C7-OCH3) [21]. 13C-NMR [CDC13]: d 142.7 (C-2'), 104.8 (C-3'), 112.9 (C-3), 102.4 (C-4a), 100.2 (C-5), 105.8 (C-8), 142.7 (C-8a), 59.1 (4-OCH3), 56.2 (6-OCH3), 56.0 (7-OCH3) [21].\n\n_Skimmianine_ (**4**). 1H-NMR [CDC13, d (ppm), \\(J\\) (Hz)]: d 7.54 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-C2'), 7.00 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.5 Hz, H-C3'), 7.95 (d, \\(J\\) = 9.5 Hz, H-C5), 7.17 (d, \\(J\\) = 9.5 Hz, H-C6), 4.39 (s, H-C4-OCH3), 4.06 (s, H-C7-OCH3), 3.97 (s, H-C8-OCH3) [14, 21]. 13C-NMR [CDC13]: d 143.2 (C-2'), 104.7 (C-3'), 118.2 (C-5), 112.4 (C-6), 59.8 (4-OCH3), 56.8 (7-OCH3), 61.7 (8-OCH3) [15, 21].\n\n_Maculine_ (**5**). 1H-NMR [CDC13, d (ppm), \\(J\\) (Hz)]: d 7.56 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.4 Hz, H-C2'), 7.03 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.4 Hz, H-C3'), 7.46 (s, H-C5), 7.21 (s, H-C8), 6.07 (s, H-C2\"), 4.41 (s, H-C4-OCH3) [16, 21].\n\n_Flindersiamine_ (**6**). 1H-NMR [CDC13, d (ppm), \\(J\\) (Hz)]: d 7.52 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.4 Hz, H-C2'), 6.99 (d, \\(J\\) = 2.4 Hz, H-C3'), 7.19 (s, H-C5), 6.00 (s, H-C2\"), 4.39 (s, H-C4-OCH3), 4.19 (s, H-C8-OCH3) [21].\n\n\n\n## Page 7\n\n\n\n### Anticholinesterasic assay\n\nAcetylcholinesterase activity was measured using a 96-well microplate reader [24] based on Ellman's method [25]. In the 96-well plates, 25 mL of 15 mM acetylcholinesterase iodide (ATCI) in water, 125 mL of 3 mM DTNB in buffer C, 50 mL of buffer B, 25 mL of plant extract, alkaloid or hexane fractions (0.2 to 100.0 mg mL-1) were added and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s for three times. Then 25 mL of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme were added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min for two times. The percentage of inhibition was calculated by comparison with the rates for the sample to a blank (10% MeOH in Buffer A). The following buffers were used. Buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; buffer B: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction (BSA); buffer C: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2*6H2O.\n\n### Statistical analysis of data\n\nData were presented as means +- SEM of experiments realized at least in triplicate. The IC50 values were calculated by means of regression analysis.\n\n## 4 Conclusions\n\nThe alkaloids kokusaginine, findersiamine, maculine and leiokinine A were previously isolated from _E. leiocarpa_. On the other hand, this is the first occurrence of leptomerine and skimmianine in _Esenbeckia leiocarpa_. There are many compounds identified from higher plants with acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity as huperzine A, galanthamine isolated from _Huperzia serrata_ (Thunb.) Trev. [26] and _Galanthus nivalis_ Lumikello, respectively, and used for dementia treatment.\n\nSome biological activities have been reported for the alkaloids isolated in this work, but none have been found to be related to acetylcholinesterase inhibition. This work demonstrated that these alkaloids presented potent anticholinesterasic activity and must be tested in pharmacological models _in vivo_ to determine if they have activity on memory of mice and pre clinical studies before human application.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was funded by grants of Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) within the BIOTA/FAPESP - The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program (www.biotasp.org.br); grant no. 03/02176-7).

Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of _H. oreadica_, _H. brasiliana_ and _H. superba_ searching for other secondary metabolites present in substantial amounts for taxonomic analysis. In a continuation of the investigation of the _H. oreadica_, three new limonoids have now been isolated 9a-hydroxylortiolide A, 11b-hydroxyhortiolide C and 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxycinnabin. All the isolated compounds from the _Hortica_ species reinforce its position in the Rutaceae. With regard to limonoids the genus produces highly specialized compounds, whose structural variations do not occur in any other member of the Rutaceae, thus, it is evident from limonoid data that _Hortica_ takes an isolated position within the family. In addition, _H. superba_ afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen, which may not be a genuine natural product. Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle-spinning \\({}^{13}\\)C nuclear magnetic resonance, X-Ray fluorescence and Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy experiments show that the Sephadex LH-20 was modified after treatment with NaOCl, suggesting that when xanthotoxin (8-methoxy-psoralen) was extracted from cleaning of the gel column, chlorination of the aromatic system occurred.\n\n## Keywords:\n\n_Horia oreadica_; _H. brasiliana_; _H. superba_; Rutaceae; limonoids; alkaloids; coumarins; dihydrocinnamic acids; Sephadex LH-20; chlorination \n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nPrevious investigations of _H. oreadica_ reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids [1-3]. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of _H. oreadica_, _H. brasiliana_ and _H. superba_. Three new limonoids have now been isolated (**1**-**3**), **1** and **3** from taproots and **2** from stem of _H. oreadica_. In addition, _H. superba_ afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (**4**) from branches (Figure 1).\n\nHalogenate natural products are widespread, though not particularly common. Hypohalite (HOX) is the halogenating species produced by haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. This may be considered as a source of electron-deficient halogen (X+) that can react with an electron-rich centre in the substrate, as the coumarins. In contrast, the most common types of halogenated coumarins are those with a prenyl epoxide ring, which was cleaved under acid conditions (H+/Cl-). There is some suspicion that these compounds are artefacts of the isolation procedures. These compounds are a comparatively rare group isolated from Rutaceae plants such as in _Toddalia asiatica_ [5,7-dimethoxy-6-(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)coumarin], _Murraya paniculata_ [7-methoxy-8-(1-hydroxy-2-chloro-3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin, 7-methoxy-8-(1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin], and in _Triphasia trifolia_ [7-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)-8-(3-methyl-2-oxobutyl)coumarin, 5-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)psoralen] [4-6]. Aromatic systems react with chlorine in an electrophilic substitution reaction, in which chlorine acts as the electrophile (Cl+), whose presence is rare in the isolation procedures. 3-Chloro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-chromen-2-one appears to be unique as natural metabolite in the coumarin class, which was isolated from leaves of _Ficus krishnae_, Moraceae [7]. Most of the phytochemical studies on Rutaceae genera have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed coumarin containing chlorine in the 1-benzopyran-2-one skeleton if they had been present. In developing countries, as in Brazil, where universities and research funding agencies cannot afford Sephadex (LH-20) in sufficient quantities for scientific studies, using cleaning gel with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a common practice. However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of Sephadex LH-20 and hypochlorite in the formation of compound **4**, until the cleaning gel is analyzed by solid NMR, X-Ray fluorescence (XRF), Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), Infrared (IR), and Fourier transform Raman (FTR) to confirm whether this can serve as an efficient chloronium ion supplier.\n\nFigure 1: Compounds isolated from _H. oreadica_ (**1**–**3**), _H superba_ (**4**), and model compounds.\n\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n\n\n## 2 Results and Discussion\n\n### Structure Elucidation of New Compounds\n\nThe spectra of compounds **1**-**4** can be seen in Figures S1-S30 in the online Supplementary. Compound **1** showed spectral characteristics close to those of hortiolide A (**5**) (C27H32O7; Figure 1), which has previously been isolated from _H. colombiana_ (_H. colombiana_ = _H. brasiliana_) [8]. HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H32O8 for compound **1**, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with **5**. The main change observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound **1** was the presence of a signal of a hydrogen of a hydroxyl group at d 2.94 (s). This hydrogen at d 2.94 showed HMBC correlation with the 13C-NMR signals of C-8 (d 90.2). The methyl proton signal at d 1.52, assigned to Me-19, showed cross peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-1 (d 178.8), C-5 (d 42.3), C-10 (d 50.6), and at d 80.5 (quaternary), allowing the assignment of the last signal to C-9, since it was the only carbon left in the skeleton for a 3\\(J\\). These correlations indicated the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-9. The relative stereochemistry of compound **1** was determined from gNOESY experiments. The nOes of the H3-19 (d 1.52), H3-18 (d 1.21) and H3-30 (d 1.71), coming from 9-OH (d 2.94), required the 9-OH to be _syn_ (a) to Me-18, Me-19 and Me-30. The structure of the new natural product **1** was thus established as 9a-hydroxyhortiolide A. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of hortiolide A (**5**) [9].\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \\hline\n**H** & **1** & **2** & **3** & **H** & **4** & **4 \\(\\ast\\)** \\\\ \\hline\n1 & & & 4.04 (brd, 4.2) & 3 & 6.45 (d, 9.8) & 6.46 (d, 10.0) \\\\\n2a & 5.45 (s) & 5.49 (s) & 2.94 (dd, 16.8, 4.2) & 4 & 8.15 (d, 9.8) & 8.17 (d, 10.0) \\\\\n2b & & & 2.58 (dd, 16.8, 1.4) & 2’ & 7.70 (d, 2.2) & 7.72 (d, 2.2) \\\\\n5 & 2.61 (m) & 2.71 (dd, 5.7, 3.3) & 2.25 (dd, 13.7, 2.6) & 3’ & 6.92 (d, 2,2) & 6.93 (d, 2.2) \\\\\n6a & 2.57 (m) & 3.43 (dd, 18.8, 5.7) & 1.78 (m) & 8-OMe & 4.29 (s) & 4.28 (s) \\\\\n6b & & 2.41 (dd, 18.8, 3.3) & 1.88 (m) & & & \\\\\n7 & & & 4.56 (t, 2.6) & & & \\\\\n9 & & & 2.72 (dd, 12.6, 6.6) & & & \\\\\n11a & 1.41 (m) & 4.4\n\n## Page 4\n\nCompound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) to hortiolide C (**6**) isolated previously from dichloromethane extract of taproots of _H. oreadica_[2].

The signal for H-12 was coupled to the 1H signal at d 4.43 (d, \\(J\\) = 4.8 Hz) assigned to H-11, indicating a hydroxyl group at C-11. HREIMS showed the molecular formula C27H32O9 and confirmed the structure **2** for this compound. In the g-NOESY experiments, the nOes of the H3-19 (d 1.54) and H3-30 (d 1.80), coming from H-11 (d 4.43), required the 11-OH to be _anti_ (b) to Me-18 and Me-30. Thus, the structure of compound **2** was proposed as 11b-hydroxyhortiolide C.\n\nThe NMR spectra and extensive analysis of 2D-NMR spectra (Table 2) suggested the ichangin-type (7) [12] framework for compound **3**. Some of the changes observed in the NMR spectra were signals for the presence of a secondary acetoxyl group (13C signals d 169.6, 21.4, 1H signal -OCOMe d 2.15). A significant downfield shift for C-1 (d 80.0), when compared with ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7), determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. The 13C signal at d 80.0 showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 4.04 (brd, \\(J\\) = 4.2 Hz), which showed cross-peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-3 (d 169.4), C-19 (d 65.6), and C-9 (d 43.3). The 1H signal at d 4.04 and a methyl signal at d 2.15 showed long-range correlation with the 13C-NMR signals at d 169.6, confirming an acetoxyl group at C-1. A second change observed in the 13C-NMR spectra was the replacement of the resonance for a carbonyl by signal for an oxymethine carbon at d 73.2, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 4.56 (t, \\(J\\) = 2.6 Hz). A hydroxyl group must thus be connected to C-7 due to the observed correlations of the 1H signal at d 4.56 with the 13C-NMR for C-5 at d 53.6, C-8 at d 43.0 and C-30 at d 18.4. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7). The NOE of the H-1 (d 4.04) coming from H-5 (d 2.25) and H-9 (d 2.72) were weak but definite, suggesting a spatial proximity of H-1a to H-5a and H-9a, and confirming the acetoxyl group in the b-configuration as in ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7, S* configuration at C-1) [12]. In addition, the NOE of the H-7 (d 4.56) coming from H3-30 (d 0.95) required the hydroxyl group at C-7 to be _anti_ (a) to H3-30 (b). The structure of the new natural product **3** was thus established as 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxycinchangin. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of ichangin (7) [12].\n\nThe coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (**4**) was not separated from xanthotoxin (**8**) and isopimpinellin (**9**). The 1H-NMR in addition to signals described in the literature for **8** and **9**, revealed signals nearly the same as that of **9** (Table 1). In addition four methoxyl group signals were observed at d 4.27, 4.16 (6H), and 4.29, which were placed at C-8 in **8**, C-5 and C-8 in **9** and at C-8 in **4**, respectively, by NOE experiments. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of coumarins if C-5 is unsubstituted the doublets arising from H-3 and H-4 are found at _ca_ d 6.2 and 7.6, respectively. The downfield shift of the H-4 to about d 8 0.0 occurs in C-5 alkoxyl-substituted coumarins, as in **9** in comparison with **8**[13]. Hence, the doublets at d 7.76, 8.11 and 8.15 were assigned to H-4 for **8**, **9**, and **4**, respectively, and indicating that C-5 was substituted in **4**. This mixture was analyzed by GC-MS (Figures S26-S29 in supplementary), which established that the coumarins were xanthotoxin (**8**), isopimpinellin (**9**), and indicated the compound **4** to contain chlorine, determining the position of this halogen at C-5, whose spectroscopic properties accord with the above data. This mixture was also analyzed by ESI-MS (Figure 30 in supplementary), which showed protonated molecule ([M + H+]) at _m/z_ 251.5 and ([M + H+]) 253.5 for compound **4**. Simulation of isotope ratio mass spectrum for C12H7O4Cl provided the differences in \n\n## Page 6\n\nnaturally-occurring isotopic abundances, which showed peaks similar to those found for compound **4**, the [M+2 + H+] (_m/z_ 253) peak about one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak ([M + H+] _m/z_ 251), confirming the presence of chlorine. Although, the structure of **4** has been described as being a synthetic product and the 1H-NMR data for both are in close agreement with the structure proposed 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen [10].\n\n### Sephadex LH-20 Analysis\n\nThe mixture of coumarins **4**, **8** and **9** was purified by gel permeation column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20, which was repacked with cleaning gel with sodium hypochlorite (0.8% watery solution). Sephadex LH-20 is cross-linked dextran which has been hydroxypropylated to yield a chromatographic media with both hydrophilic and lipophilic character [14,15]. Solid-state cross-polarization/magic-angle-spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS 13C-NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural product formed by the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite. Pure Sephadex LH-20 and the gel, which was washed only with sterile distilled water and allowed to swell overnight, were used as control. The HETCOR experiment (Figure 2) permitted the assignments of the protonated carbons signals at d 97-94, 72-70, 68-63, and 15-20 to all C-1, C-2-4, C-5-6 and the methyl of propyl group, respectively, comparable with those reported for dextran samples [16,17]. It is clear that water induces no change in chemical shifts as shown in Figure 3. However, it is noted that the treatment with water leads to the increase of the linewidth. Another important observation which should be noted regards the intensity of the signals related to the carbons from glycoside units. For non-treated Sephadex, the hydroxyl groups from glycoside units in different polymeric chains interact through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the structure becomes very rigid, favoring the dipolar coupling. In this case the cross polarization is more efficient and the signals become more intense, even when compared to side aliphatic branches [18]. The 13C-NMR spectrum for cleaning gel (Figure 3) showed that the signals for all C-1 (d 97-94) were of markedly different intensity (lowest intensity), suggesting the oxidation of a-D-glucopyranoses by hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which would result in depolymerisation [19]. In Sephadex LH-20 C-2-4 are hydroxypropylated, thus d-aldonolactone could have glycosidic linkages by hydroxypropyl groups. This spectrum also showed that sodium hypochlorite affected the shape of the 13C-NMR signals for all C-2-4 (d 81-70), suggesting that the oxidation reaction of free -OH at carbons C-2 and C-3 may have occurred. The C-5, C-6 and methyl signals of control and cleaning gel appeared at similar chemical shifts. The CP/MAS 13C-NMR experiments showed that the course of the reaction with hypochlorite is somewhat more complex than the oxidation indicated for C-1, C-2 and C-3. Hypochlorite specifically oxidizes the a anomer, and the initial product formed is a d-aldonolactone (Scheme 1). Although, the free -OH in the glycoside units and in the hydroxypropyl groups must have been involved in the reaction with hypochlorous acid formed in the equilibrium of sodium hypochlorite and H2O, resulting in dextran ether hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which can serve as an efficient chloronium ion supplier [20,21].\n\n\n\n## Page 7\n\nFigure 3: Carbon-13 solid state NMR spectra for pure Sephadex LH-20 and after treatment with water and aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite NaOCI. All the spectra were obtained under CPMAS conditions with total sideband suppression.\n\nFigure 2: Solid state two-dimensional heteronuclear \\({}^{13}\\)C-\\({}^{1}\\)H correlation (HETCOR) NMR for pure Sephadex LH-20, and Sephadex-H\\({}_{2}\\)O-NaOCI.\n\n\n\n## Page 8\n\n\n\n**Scheme 1.** Proposed synthetic pathway for hypohalogenation by dextran ether hypochlorite, and reactions of HOCl with Sephadex LH-20.\n\nFurthermore, the shape of the \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR signals for all C-2-4 (6 81-70) is clearer when the ratio A60-90ppm/A20ppm is used for this purpose. For pure Sephadex this ratio is 4.0, for Sephadex-H2O it is approximately 3.3 and for Sephadex-H2O-NaOCl it is 2.0. This variation seems to be quite intriguing, but it is possible that this is related to the exchange of hydrogen by chlorine atoms, which occurred in the polar hydroxyl groups from the glycoside units. Furthermore, the presence of chlorine atoms and water molecules induce the increasing distance between chains. Once these events takes place the cross-polarization \\({}^{1}\\)H\\(\\rightarrow^{13}\\)C becomes less efficient, and the signal becomes less intense as mentioned earlier [18]. In order to observe the possible formation of dextran ether hypochlorite in the structure of Sephadex, \\({}^{35}\\)Cl solid state NMR experiments were run, however no signal was observed (as can be seen in Figure 31 in supplementary). There are few papers in the literature that investigate \\({}^{35}\\)Cl-NMR in organic compounds, and they always involve small molecules [22-24].\n\nField-emission gun scanning electron microscopy analyses of pure Sephadex LH-20, gel washed with water, and gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite showed homogeneous beads in the first two (Figures 4 and S32-S34 in supplementary). In contrast, beads originating from gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite were not homogeneous and some strange material aggregates were observed between and on the polymer beads (Figure 4). These differences suggest modification in the structure of the polymer, or the presence of reaction products with hypochlorite or of salt sodium hypochlorite and HOCl. Comparing the standard gel with those treated with NaOCl shows that there is a decrease in the diameter of some particles, suggesting a dilution or formation of other products (Figure 4D,E).\n\nX-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry was used and the results showed the presence of chlorine in pure Sephadex LH-20, in gel washed with sterile distilled water and cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (Figure 5). The chlorine content was 1.8 fold greater in the gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (0.159%) than that in pure Sephadex LH-20 (0.089%), and 2.9 than that in gel washed with water (0.055%).\n\n\n\n## Page 9\n\nFigure 4: FEG-SEM micrographs of pure Sephadex LH-20 (**A**,**E**) and after treatment with water (**B**) and aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite NaOCl (**C**,**D**).\n\nFigure 5: XRF spectrum of pure Sephadex LH-20 and after treatment with water and aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite NaOCl.\n\n\n\n## Page 10\n\nThese gels were also examined by FT Raman and IR, however, the spectra obtained showed no differences between them which allow verifying the presence of O-Cl bond and lactone (Figure S35 in supplementary). These data suggest that if there were oxidation reactions and the formation of hypochlorite, their yields were low. In their FTR spectra there is a band at 847 cm-1 corresponding to the vibration of the a-anomer, characteristic of Sephadex [25].\n\nGiven that the yield of the reaction with hypochlorite was low, a second hypothesis is that the hypochlorite salt and HOCl retained on Sephadex beads react directly with the active aromatic system for aromatic substitution reactions with HOCl.\n\nConcluding two synthetic pathways to chlorination is possible, in the presence of dextran ether hypochlorite or HOCl retained on Sephadex beads, and when the mixture of xanthotoxin (**8**) and isopimpinellin (**9**) were extracted from cleaning Sephadex LH-20 column, the chlorination of aromatic system occurred in **8** giving 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen. These results showed that the use of cleaning Sephadex LH-20, deserves more attention than it has received so far.\n\n### Identification of Known Compounds\n\nThe major types of rutaceous secondary metabolites were also isolated and they show that _H. oreadica_, _H.brasiliana and H. superba_ are related to other species of _Hortia_. However, the alkaloids _N_-methylatanine, robustine [26,27], 7,8-dehydrorutaecarpine [28], edulitine [29], integriquinolone [30], the coumarins psoralen, bergapten, xanthotoxin, 5-methoxyseselin, braylin, isopimpinellin, prangol, heraclenol, seselin, 5-methoxyseselin [31], the flavonoids isosakuranetin [32], acacetin [29], neoponcirin [33], and the limonoid limonin [34] are reported for the first time from the _Hortia_.\n\nGroppo and collaborators [35,36] studying plants of the genus _Hortia_ showed that _H. brasiliana_, _H. arborea_, _H. colombiana_ and _H. chocoensis_ represent the same arborescent species, and that _H. brasiliana_ V. and ex. DC. _H. badini_ M.A. Lisboa was used to designate individuals of _Hortia_, but this error was corrected by Groppo and collaborators [35], who recognized it as _H. brasiliana_. The name _H. brasiliana_ was wrongly applied to a shrubby species of central Brazil by Saint-Hilaire, today recognized as _H. oreadica_ Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani [35]. _H. superba_ Ducke, _H. regia_ Sandwith and _H. longifolia_ Spruce (ex. Engl) are accepted species in the genus _Hortia_ according to Groppo and Pirani [36]. The known compounds isolated in this work and occurrences in other _Hotia_ species can be seen in supplementary Table S1.\n\n## Experimental Section\n\n### Instrumentation\n\nOptical rotations were measured by using a Perkin Elmer 241 spectropolarimeter, or DIP 370 Jasco. High resolution EI-MS: VG Autospec-Fisons by using electron ionization technique at 70 eV (linked scan at 8 keV collisions with Helium); HRESI-MS analyses were performed on an UltroTOF-Q (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) fitted with an electrospray ion source operating in the positive ion mode; the accuracy masses were obtained by using of TFA-Na+ (sodiated trifluoroacetic acid) as internal standard; samples were directly infused into the ionization source at a flow rate of 10 mL/min the source block and desolvation temperature was 150 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. IR: Bomen-Ft/IR. FEG-SEM\n\n## Page 11\n\nmicrographs: Supra 35-VP, Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany. NMR: Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard. All the solid state NMR experiments were performed in a Bruker Avance III 400 machine, operating at a 9.4 T magnetic field, which corresponds to 399.94 MHz for 1H, 100.57 MHz for 13C and 39.206 MHz for 35Cl resonance frequencies. This machine is equipped with a MAS 4mm broadband solid state probehead. The sample (powdered) was packed in a 4mm zirconia rotor, and a KEL-F cap. The carbon-13 1D spectra were obtained by using a ramped cross polarization under magic angle spinning with total side band suppression (pulse sequence named CPTOSS). These experiments were conducted at 298 K and using a spinning speed of 5000 Hz. The CPTOSS parameters were: contact time of 2 ms, recycle delay of 5 s, acquisition time of 34 ms, spectral width of 295 ppm and 512 scans were averaged. High power decoupling was done by using a TPPM15 decoupler program under a 1H field of 70 KHz. 2D 1H-13C FSLG-HETCOR experiment were run at 10,000 Hz of spinning speed. The pulse sequence parameters were: recycle delay of 2 s, contact time of 200 ms for observing spin diffusion signals, number of scans of 32, LG field of 80 KHz, acquisition time of 16 ms and SPNAL64 for decoupler program at 70KHz of 1H irradiation, and 256 transients were obtained in F1. FSLG-HETCOR was performed at only 298 K, in a total time of 4.5 h. The pulse sequence used for acquiring 35Cl solid state NMR was one pulse with acquisition time of 44 ms, a spectral window of 1200 ppm and the spinning speed was 10,000 Hz. For all the experiments the sample was spun by using gaseous nitrogen. FT Raman: I-Raman 485-H, Laser 785 nm BWTEK (USA). XRF: MiniPal 4, PW 4024, P Analytical B.V. (Almelo, The Netherlands).\n\n### Cleaning Sephadex LH-20 and Repacked Column\n\nWhen a column has been in use for some time, it may be necessary to remove contaminants. Thus the gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by gentle agitation and was allowed to react overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was washed three times with sterile distilled water to remove residual NaOCl. After cleaning, the column was carefully re-equilibrated with 2-3 column volumes of methanol before it is used again. Part of cleaning Sephadex was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis.\n\nThe control gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed only with sterile distilled water by gentle agitation and was allowed to swell overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis.\n\n### Plant Material\n\n_Hortic brasiliana_ V. and Ex. D.C. was collected (May 2000) in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. _H. oreadica_ Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani was collected (September 2005) in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. _H. superba_ Ducke was collected (December 2001) in road from Manaus to Itacoatiara km 31, Amazonas state, Brazil. All the plants were identified by Jose Rubens Pirani of the Department of Botany, University of Sao Paulo, and vouchers are deposited in the herbarium of the same department (Pirani 4672 and Groppo Jr. 458, Groppo Jr. 950, respectively).\n\n\n\n## Page 12\n\n\n\n### Extraction and Isolation\n\nGround taproots (3.3 kg), stems (2.4 kg) and leaves (3.2 kg) of _Hortica oreadica_, stem (938 g), stem bark (270 g) and leaves (655 g) of _H. brasiliana_, stem (938 g), and stem bark (270 g) of _H. superba_ were successively extracted using hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH, at room temperature. Small branches of _H. superba_ were also analyzed, and ground branches (483 g) were extracted 3 times at room temperature using ethanol. All extracts were monitored by 1H-NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS. Only those displaying features of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives and limonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined.\n\nThese extracts were repeatedly purified by silica gel column chromatography (CC, 230-400 mesh), gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH-20), preparative TLC, by the centrifugal preparative TLC performed on a chromatotron of Harrison research 50B, Spectra/Chrom CF1-fraction collector, silica gel 375 mesh, diameter 26 cm, and then by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification (polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G). Details on the isolation can be found in Supplementary Materials.\n\nThe concentrated hexane extract (3.0 g) from the taproots yielded the coumarin 5-methoxyseselin (12 mg). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract (67.6 g) from the taproots was subjected to CC over silica gel (70-230 mesh; 20.0 x 8.0 cm) in vacuum, elution with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The CH2Cl2 fraction (7.1 g) afforded the alkaloids roubstine (7 mg), dictamnine (36 mg), rutaocarpine (91 mg), _N_-methylatanine (15 mg), hortiacine (2.5 mg), and _g_-fagarine (10 mg), the coumarins psoralen (3.7 mg), bergapten (3 mg), xanthotoxin (2.3 mg), braylin (4.5 mg), and scoparon (25 mg). The EtOAc fraction (4.5 g) from the concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from the taproots yielded the alkaloids 7,8-dehydrorutaocarpine (35.0 mg), rutaocarpine (98 mg), dictamnine (17 mg), and the coumarin 5-methoxyseselin (17 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract (1.65 g) from the taproots afforded the limonoids 6-hydroxyhortiolide C (8.1 mg), **3** (4.1 mg), limonin (9.3 mg) and **1** (5.5 mg).\n\nThe concentrated MeOH extract (3.0 g) from stem of _H. oreadica_ was partitioned into hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH soluble fractions. The hexane and dichloromethane soluble fractions were combined into a single one (0.6 g) on the basis of analytical TLC, which was also repeatedly purified yielding the limonoids hortiolide D (7.1 mg), **2** (6.1 mg), hortiolide E (5.9 mg) and 12b-hydroxymethylide E (7.9 mg), the alkaloid _N_-methyl-4-methoxy-quinolin-2-one (22.6 mg). The EtOAc soluble fraction afforded the coumarin bergapten (5.2 mg).\n\nThe dichloromethane extract from _H. oreadica_ leaves (2.5 g) afforded the alkaloids rutaocarpine (110 mg) and dictamnine (88 mg).\n\nThe hexane and dichloromethane extracts from the stem of _H. brasiliana_ were combined into a single one on the basis of analytical TLC (4.5 g), which was purified yielding the alkaloids rutaocarpine (28.4 mg), hortiacine (114 mg), and skimmianine (3.5 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract (1.65 g) from stem afforded the alkaloids _N_-methyl-4-methoxy-quinolin-2-one (55 mg), skimmianine (9.1 mg), _g_-fagarine (2.8 mg), hortiacine (159 mg), the coumarins bergapten (9.5 mg), 5-methoxyseselin (27 mg), and the dihydrocinnamic acid 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (83 mg).\n\nThe hexane and dichloromethane extracts from the stem bark of _H. brasiliana_ were also combined into a single extract on the basis of analytical TLC (2.1 g), which yielded a mixture of sitosterol and stigmasterol (19 mg), the alkaloids rutaocarpine (11 mg), and hortiacine (23 mg). The dichloromethane\n\n## Page 13\n\nextract of _H. brasiliana_ leaves (3.0 g) gave the alkaloid hortiacine (87 mg), and the dihydrocinnamic acid methyl 5-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2_H_-1-benzopyran-6-pronanoate (80 mg).\n\nThe concentrated CH2Cl2 extract (3.2 g) from stem bark of _H. superba_ yielded a mixture of sitosterol and stigmasterol (69 mg), the alkaloids dictamnine (3.5 mg), rutaocarpine (8.4 mg), flavanone isosakuranetin (43 mg), the coumarins prangol (9.1 mg), and heraclenol (9.6 mg).

A exiscata (ndeg7051) encontra-se depositada no Herbario da Universidade Estadual de Goias, Campus Henrique Santillo, Anapolis - GO.\n\n### Isoamento dos constituintes quimicos\n\nAs cascas do caule (Cc; 1.465 g) e folhas (F; 1.140 g) de _V. thyrsoidea_, apos secagem em esufta a 40deg C e moagen, foram extradas con ethanol. Apos eliminacao dos solventes sob presenta reduzida, os extratos brutos foram obtidos [Cc (23,0 g) e F (150,0 g)]. O extra otunado das cascas do coule foi particionado com MeOH-H2O (1:3) e solventes de diferentes polaridades [hexano (1,5 g), CH2Cl2 (1,3g), AcOEt (7,3 g), _n_-BuOH (1,0 g) e hidroalcolico (10,8 g)] enquanto que o das folias foi fractionado com cellulose microcristalina D, fomecendo os extratos em hexano (5,6 g), CH2Cl2 (15,8 g), AcOEt (52,3 g) de MeOH (50,7 g).\n\nA fragile diclorometanica das cascas do caule (1,3 g) foi cromatografada em duna etaga utilizando cromatografa de adsorcao em gel de silica, ambas em eluica iscortica com Hex:AcOEt (8,5:1,5). Desta atilima etapa cromatografica foram obtidas 11 fracoes, dentre as quais a segunda fracao foi identificada por comparacao dos dados espectroscopics de RMN 1H e 1degC com a literatura como ot triperpen acido 3-oxo-urs-12en-28-oico (2,0 mg).3\n\nA fracao 7 (190,0 mg) foi reficada por cromatografia de coulano de ed libica mondo isocidero Hex:AcOEt (7:3), trazendo o isolamento do cido 2,4,6-trimetoxinebenoico (5,2 mg), cuja estrutura foi proposta com base em dados espectrais de de RMN 1H e 1degC e comparacao com a literatura.4\n\nO fractionamento do extrato de AcOEt das cascas do caule (7,3 g) foi ratio aravdes de cromatografia em coluna (CC) de gel de silica,usando como fase davecol os solventes AcOEt:MeOH com gradiente de eluica con orden crescente de polaridade. Desta columa obteve-se 85 fracoes, que foram submetidas a analise por CCDA e entao reunidas em 4 fracoes.\n\nA segunda fracao (1,0 g) foi submetida a CC de gel de silica, usando como fase d'mvel CH2Cl2MeOH (4:1) no modo iscorticario de eluicao, o qual proporcionou o isolamento da substitaca **1** (3.0 mg).\n\nApos successivos fracamientos desta fragao 2 por cromatografia de excluso (Sephadex LH-20) e luicao em MeOH 100%, obteve-se a substancia **2** (3,0 mg) identificada por RMN 1D/2D.5\n\n_Catequin-3-O-(3\"-trans-cianonil)-a-raminopiranosideo (1)._ HRESIMs _m/z_: 549,1755 [M - H]* (calc. para C3\\(H\\)3O_10, 550,1839) RMN 1H e 1degC:Tabela 1.\n\n_Catequin-3-O-(4-rammaipiranosideo (2)._ RMN 1H(400 MHz, CD,DD) &(m,mid); _r_-m Hz; 7,22 (_d_ = 8,5; H-2; e* H-6); 6,78 (_d_; \\(J\\) =8,5; H-3' = H-5'; 5,93 (_d_; \\(J\\) =2,4; H-6); 5,84 (_d_; \\(J\\) =2,4; H-8); 4,65 (_d_; \\(J\\) =8,0; H-2); 4,25 (_d_; \\(J\\) =1,6; H-1\"); 3,95 (_m_; H-3'); 3,70 (_m_; H-3\"); 3,68 (_m_; H-4\"); 3,62 (_dd_; \\(J\\) =3,2 \\(e\\); 9,2; H-2\"); 3,20 (_m_; H-5\"); 2,91 (_dd_; \\(J\\) =16,5 ; e 6,0; H-40); 2,64 (_dd_; \\(J\\) =16,4 e,8; H-4b); 1,24 (_d_; \\(J\\) =6,4; H-6\"); HSQC e HMBC (H: 400 MHz, 1degC: 100 MHz, CD,DD) &(c: 145,0 (C-5); 130,0 (C-1'); 129,0 (C-2'); 5,25 (C-6'); 116,3 (C-3' e C-5'); 120,0 (C-1'e\" C-10); 96,2 (C-6'); 95,0 (C-8); 81,02 (C-2'); 76,2 (C-3'); 72,18 (C-3'); 71,5 (C-4\"); 73,0 (C-5\"); 31,0 (C-6'); 23,3 (C-\n\n## Page 3\n\nAs substancias foram diluidas em DMSO puro e esterfil na contentracao de 5 mg/mL (dose unica) e adicionadas em placas de 96 pocos (100 mL/poco),onde a analise de cada amostra foi feita a partir de dois experimentos realizados em duplicata, tendo como controle positivo o quimiteriperico doxorubicina.\n\nApos um período de incubacao de 72 horas, a absorbancia foi lida em um espectrofotometro de placas (DTX 880 Multimode Detector) a um comprimento de onda de 550 nm.7 Os resultados foram analisados segundo suas medias e respectivos desvios-padrao no programa _GraphPad Prism_.\n\n### Ensaio de inibicao enzimatica: catepsinas B e K\n\nOs ensaios de inibicao enzimatica frente a categnina B e K foram realizados no Laboratorio de Produtos Naturais da Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, usando-se as mesmas condiçoes experimentais para ambas as catepsinas.\n\nA methodologia aplicada, com algumas modificacoes, consiste na determinacao in abibicao enzimatica através da deteccao do aumento da fluorescencia que ocorre com a hidrolase do substrato fluorogenico Z-FRMCA, o qual e detectado em espectrofluorimento com fenda de excitacao ajustada para A\\(\\&\\)x = 380 nm e emissao \\(\\&\\)cm = 460 nm.8 O modelo de espectrofluorimento utilizado neste ensaio foi da Molecular Devices Corporation \\(-\\) Sperra MAX M3 GEMINI XS. Os ensaios foram feticos em triplicatas, nos nous a massa foram diluidas em DMSO, obtendo uma concentrazao final do como de 125 mM.\n\nUm volume de 5 mL foi transferido para cada poco das placas de ELISA (96 pocos) e adicionou-se o MIX 1 e a enzima em concentracao 3 mM em tampao (acetato de sodio 100 mM com 5 mM de EDTA e pH de 5,5) pr-ativada com DTE (5,0 mM) aos analitos. A enzima flecun con tanto com os compostos por 5 minutos e posteriormente foram adiicionados 10 mM do MIX 2 (substrao fluorogenico Z-FRMCA em tampao), realizando-se a leitura em seguida.\n\nPara os compostos que apresentamar imibica significativa (superior ou igual a 80%) frente as enzimas testadas foram determinados os valores de IC\\({}_{50}\\). O potencial de inibicao foi determinado utilizando-se dez diferentes concentracoes do inibidor e construindo uma curva de concentracao x resposta pelo metodo de regressa nao-linear do programa Origin.\n\n## RESULTSAC\n\nA substancia **1** foi identificada pela analise dos espectros de RMN \\({}^{1}\\)H, HSQC e HMBC (Tabela 1) e massa de alta resolucao (HRESIMS) em comparacao com a literatura.39\n\nO espectro de massa de alta resolucao foi obtido no modo negativo, e exibiu um pico caracteristico do fon em 549,1755 [M - H]-, sugerindo a formula molecular C\\({}_{3}\\)H\\({}_{3}\\)O\\({}_{10^{\\circ}}\\).\n\nNo espectro de RMN de \\({}^{1}\\)H a substancia **1** apresento suaisa na regiao de hidrogenios alifaticos [d \\(\\&\\) 4,69 (_d_; \\(J\\) = 7,6 Hz), 3,98 (_m_), 82,97 (_dd_; \\(J\\) = 15,2 \\(\\&\\) 5,2 Hz) e 2,71 (_dd_; \\(J\\) = 15,6 \\(\\&\\) 8,4 Hz)], caracteristicos dos hidrogenios H-2, H-3 e dos hidrogenios diastereoticpicos H-4a e H-4b respectivamente.

A substancia nova foi caracterizada atraves de dados espectroscopicos como sendo ferulato de 11-O-_trans_-teuverena.\n\nA new antifungal iridoid compound, together with three active known iridoids, galioside, galioside aglucone, and apodanthoside, as well as 3-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-28-O-b-D-glucopyranoside alto\n\nnosyl quinovic acid and quercetin-3-O-methyl-3-O-b-D-d-rhamnopyranoside, were isolated from the stems of _Tocoyena formosa_. This new compound was characterized by spectral data as 11-O-_trans_-feruloylteucerin.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSeveral tropical Brazilian Rubiaceae species from the rain forests and _cerrado_, produce phytoalexins in response to fungal inoculation [1]. Among the 15 assayed species, plants of the _Tocoyena formosa_ collected in Mogi-Guacu, in the state of Sao Paulo, showed positive phytoalexin response during the entire year except during winter [2], A positive response is not necessarily associated with the appearance of phytoalexins, but could be caused by inhibitns. After TLC bioassays the extracts obtained from the leaves and stems of this species revealed several different fungitoxic zones. Recently we reported the isolation and structural determination of four iridoids from the leaves of _T. formosa_. Two of them, _a_- and _b_- gardiol, showed inhibitory activity against fungal growth [3]. We now describe the isolation and characterization of four iridoids, 3-6, from the stems of _T. Formosa_, with antifungal properties, as well as the inactive, known compounds 1-2. The new iridoid 6 and the known iridoids 3-5 showed activity against the growth of _Cladosporium cladosporioides_ (Fres.) de Vries (Demiaaceae). This is a common phylolcladane fungus and a contaminant of many species of seeds [4]. Some strains of _C. cladosporioides_ appear to be weakly pathogenic [5]. In this paper we report the isolation and structural elucidation of this new iridoid.\n\n## Experimental\n\nIR spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Model 1600 spectrometer, 1H-NMR (200 and 400 MHz) and 13C-NMR (50 and 100.57 Mhz) spectra on a Brucker and a Varian Unity 400, respectively, at 25deg; EI-MS and HRMS: MS Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Virginia, USA.\n\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n\n\n### Plant material\n\nStems of _Tocoyena formosa_ were collected from preserved areas of a Brazilian _cerrado_ in the biological reserve of the Mogi-Guacu Ecological and Experimental Station, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen (# SP 178799) was deposited in the Maria Eneida Fidalgo Herbarium of the Instituto de Botanica de Sao Paulo.\n\n### Extraction and isolation of the constituents\n\nDried and powdered stems (2.0 kg) of _T. formosa_ were successively extracted in soxhlet with hexane and EtOH. The hexane extract (310 mg) was fractioned by silica gel column chromatography (6.0 g) yielding sitosterol (10 mg), b-amirin (30 mg), and fatty material. The crude ethanolic extract (200 g) was solubilized in EtOH:H2O (8:2) and partitioned into hexane (30 g), CHCl3 (22 g) and n-BuOH (45.5 g). The n-BuOH soluble fraction (250 mg) was submitted to CC on silica gel (10 g) and eluted with CH2Cl2 with increasing amounts of MeOH. After TLC, some fractions were combined and submitted to prep. TLC developed with CH2Cl2:AcOEt (4:2) and CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (68:38:10) gave 1 (13.5 mg), **2** (14.0 mg), **3** (6.2 mg, colorless gum **4** (10.5 mg, mp 113-115deg, [lit. 110-115deg]), **5** (15.0 mg, colorless gum) and **6** (20.1 mg, colorless gum).\n\n### Bioassay\n\nFungitoxic zones were detected using a spore suspension of _C. cladosporioides_12 on TLC silica gel plates developed with CHCl3:MeOH (7:3) and CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (68:38:10).\n\n11-O-_trans_fenuloylteucren **6**.

The other five compounds1**-5**, are known compounds and were identified as the triterpene saponin (3-O-b-D-glu-copranosyl-28-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl quinovic acid) 16, the flavonol glycoside (quercetin-3-O-b-D-methyl-3-rhamnopyranoside) 27, and the iridoids galioside **38**, 9, galioside aglicone **4**, and apodanthoside **5**10, 11.\n\nThe iridoid **6** showed structural features very related with teucrein, which was isolated as an acetyl derivative from _Teucrium marum_ (Labiateae)13. The molecular formula of **6** was determined as C19H22O6 from its HRMS (m/z 346.1305; calc. 346.1314). The EI-mass fragments at m/z 163 [C6H2O3]+, 135 [C8H2O2]+ and 109 [C6H5O2]+ indicated the presence of a feurolyl unity in the side chain of **6**. The IR spectrum showed diagnostic absorption bands occurring at 3294 (vOH), 1680 (vC = O a,b-unsaturated ester), 1630 (vC = C), and 1605 and 1438 cm-1 (vC = C, aromatic unity). The presence of a _trans_-feruloyl moiety was confirmed by 1H- and 13C-NMR resonance spectral data (Table 1). Analysis of the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data of **6**, including DEPT 135 and HETCOR experiments also indicated that this compound bears an iridoidal skeleton, which was identified as teucrein **7**, by comparison of \n\n## Page 4\n\nthe \\({}^{1}\\)H- and \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR chemical shifts with those reported in the literature\\({}^{13}\\). In the \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectrum of 6 relative to 7, H-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 5.00) was shielded by 0.87 ppm, while in the \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR spectrum C-1 (\\(\\delta\\) 90.1) it was shielded by 1.4 ppm. The \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectrum also showed resonances at \\(\\delta\\) 4.70 d and 4.66 d (\\(\\delta\\) 66.9), attributable to hydroxymethylene H-11, in agreement with structure 7. This observation indicated that C-11 should be the site of esterification and that in C-1 the hydroxyl group should be free. An HMDEC \\({}^{1}\\)H- \\({}^{13}\\)C-NMR (Fig. 1) correlation confirmed not only the substitution of _transfer_ly unity at C-11, but also confirmed that the hydroxyl group at C-1 is free. The structure of 6 was therefore established as the novel 11-O-_trans_-feruloylteucren.\n\nThe presence of aglicone iridoids with antifungal activity suggests that they can play a defensive role against fungal attack. However an additional study must be undertaken in order to prove whether these compounds are phytoalexins or inhibiting.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Braga, M.R.; Young, M.C.M.; Ponte, J.V.A.; Dietrich, S.M.C.; Emerenciano, V.P.; Gottlieb, O.R. _Biochem.
