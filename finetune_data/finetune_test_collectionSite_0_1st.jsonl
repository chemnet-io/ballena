Pupo 1 1 Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil 2 Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil Smallanthus sonchifolius is a traditional Andean plant which has been cultured mainly in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand due to its medicinal properties. A study of the endophytic fungi associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing 186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of Nigrospora sphaerica and Phoma betae liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3- methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential com- pounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-β-ol diterpene is being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including GC/MS, homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation. Keywords: Nigrospora sphaerica / Phoma betae / Yacon / Aphidicolin / Isocoumarin Received: March 19, 2008; accepted: June 30, 2008 DOI 10.1002/jobm.200800093 Introduction * The Asteraceae Smallanthus sonchifolius (Poepp. and Endl.) H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflamma- tory effects. Some unique substances like the anti- microbial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones [1–3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF2-9), but deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South America, New Zealand and Japan [4–7]. The plant is also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal colonization. Correspondence: Dr. Mônica T.

They may have qualitatively different rela- tionships with a single host plant, from parasitism to mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are con- sidered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages none of the partners, including the absence of external manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated fungi may produce substances with specific functions inside and outside the host plant in which they nor- mally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anti- cancer [9]. As part of the bioprospecting program in endophytic fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10–13], it was considered that S. sonchifolius, commonly named Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 Production of new cytotoxic agents 143 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.jbm-journal.com bioactive secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and biotechnological purposes. Using this approach, 32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds. Some of the compounds isolated in this research are being reported for the first time as secondary metabo- lites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant asso- ciations is discussed. Materials and methods Isolation, identification and preservation of fungal strains Yacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in Febru- ary 2006, in the city of Ribeirão Preto (S 21°11.933′ NO 47°46.699′), State of São Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Fac- ulty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirão Preto campus, University of São Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. The collected plant material was washed with run- ning tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were carried out by sequentially submerging the plant mate- rial in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were ex- cised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA me- dium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 μg/ml) and incubated initially at 30 °C for 48 h, followed by 72 h at 23 °C. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures. Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure cultures were obtained. Conidia producing strains were identified at the De- partment of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil. Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 °C in tubes contain- ing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers onto PDA slants at 4 °C. Cultivation and extraction procedures Two culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for cultivation and screening of biological activities of the isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures. Liquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1). First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incu- bated at 30 °C for 7 d. After this period, aqueous sus- pensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step, this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Büchner filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask con- taining 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This proce- dure was carried out for a small scale extract produc- tion for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cul- tures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH, followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro- Figure 1.

Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.jbm-journal.com duce the mycelial ethanolic extract (EtM). An Erlen- meyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek me- dium and treated in the same way for control purposes. For the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled wa- ter per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 °C for 40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation, one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about 2 × 2 cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incu- bation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 °C, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and the residual fraction (RS). Isolation of compounds EaS fraction (20.2 g) of Nigrospora sphaerica was fraction- ated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column (22.0 × 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents Figure 2.

Compound 2 (14.7 mg) was precipi- tated from fraction 5 (99.7 mg) using CHCl3 (step I). Fraction EaS (888.2 mg) originated from 32 day cultures of P. betae (1 flask, fungus sporulation time) was chromatographed over silica gel (400–200 mesh, 27.0 × 3.0 cm) using gradient elution with hexane: EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step J, Fig. 3) to provide 13 fractions (Pb-1 to 13). Fraction 4 (Pb-4, 21.9 mg) was submitted to HPLC using an isocratic solvent system containing hexane:EtOAc (9:1) delivered to the a semi- prep Nucleosil 100–7 column (250 × 10 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min–1, and monitored at 254 nm detection wavelength at 25 °C (step K). Compound 4 (12.1 mg) was collected at 41 min. The residual fraction (5.0 mg) collected at 45 min was resubmitted to HPLC employing a prep C18 Shimadzu column (250 × 20 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min–1, using MeOH as elu- ent, and monitored at 254 nm (step L).

Spectroscopic and chromatographic equipment 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (CDCl3, acetone-d6 or MeOH-d4) on Bruker spectrometers (DRX-400 or DRX- 500), working at 400 or 500 MHz for 1H, and at 100 or 125 MHz for 13C. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference. Mass spectra were performed in a high-resolution eletrospray Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (HR/ESI/MS) or in a Shimadzu GC/EI/MS OP2010 employing an AOC-20i auto-injector and a DBS- MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column. The high per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system con- sisted of a Shimadzu LC-6AD pump, and a SPD-20A UV- vis detector with a CBM-20A interface. Data acquisition was carried out on LC Solution software version 1.1. Tumor cell cultures and cytotoxic bioassay Human tumor cell lines MDA-MB435 (breast), HCT-8 (colon), SF295 (brain) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leuke- mia) were obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bo- vine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and strepto- mycin). Cultures were maintained in a humidified in- cubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cytotoxic effect was assessed using the MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability described by Mosmann [16] according to an established protocol [17]. Briefly, tumor cells were placed in 96-well plates at the following densities: 0.7 × 105 (HCT-8), 0.6 × 105 (SF295), 0.3 × 106 (HL-60) and 0.1 × 106 (MDA-MB435) cells/ml. Extracts and fractions were tested in a single concentration (100 μg/ml) and pure substances in a range between 0.048 and 25 μg/ml during 72 h. Control groups received the same amount of vehicle and doxorubicin (Doxolem®, Zodiac Produtos Farmacêuticos S/A, Brazil), which was used as a positive control. Growth inhibition rates were quantified as the percentage of control absorbance by the reduced dye at 550 nm in accordance with the following equation: Inhibition rate = [(OD control well – OD treated well) × (OD control well)–1] × 100 . Each sample was tested in two independent experi- ments performed in triplicates. The results consisted of the average value for each experimental unit. The IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were ob- tained by non linear regression using the GraphPad Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). An activity scale was utilized to appraise the cytotoxic potential of the tested samples: inactive sam- ples (I), samples with low activity (LA, cell growth inhi- bition between 1–50%), moderated activity (MA, cell growth inhibition between 50–75%), and high activity (HA, cell growth inhibition between 75–100%). Results and discussion Isolation and identification of fungal strains Altogether 32 species of fungi were isolated and labeled using the plant name initial letters and a number, for example, SS29 (Table 1).

Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization and five other species occurred simultaneously in two tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42, SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots. Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture conditions employed. They remain unidentified and were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated were identified by traditional taxonomical methods based on morphological features as established in Table 1. The isolated genera Drechslera, Fusarium, Phoma, Alter- naria, Curvularia, Nigrospora, Glomerella and Aspergilus have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a range of hosts [18–20]. They also have proven to be endophytes in several plant species [21–26] strengthen- ing the argument that disease is an exception in the plant-microbe interaction, which could be more prop- erly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis [27]. Genus Papulaspora is a well-known competitive soil mold in the culture of mushrooms [28, 29] and it has just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few species as Vitex negundo [24], Manilkara bidentata [30], Taxus chinensis [31], Amomum siamense [32] and Solanum tuberosum [25]. Preussia, however, is recognized either as a soil or a coprophilous genus [33, 34] but has never been mentioned before as an endophyte. Cytotoxic activity of extracts From the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL and RS were practically inactive (data not shown). The exceptions were RLSS33, RLSS75 and RLSS84, which Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 Production of new cytotoxic agents 147 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetate fractions from both culture types of P. immersa (SS13), N. sphaerica (SS67) and A. tenuissima (SS77) produced good results on all tested cells indicating that production of bioactive molecules by these fungi does not depend on the culture medium employed. These observations emphasize the significance of these species in future biotechnology studies. Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance of isolated compounds N. sphaerica (SS67) and P. betae (SS84) were chosen for large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive com- pounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts. Three substances were isolated from the N. sphaerica EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound 1 was identified as pimara-7,15-dien-3β-ol, compound 2 as ergosterol per- oxide and compound 3 as aphidicolin. Spectral data of compound 2 were in agreement with literature data [35], while compound 1, recently detected in a plant essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36]. This is the first report of compound 1 obtained from a fungal source and having its structure completely elu- cidated by 1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds 1 and 2 showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested (Table 3). Compound 3, isolated from the EaL fraction of N. sphaerica (SS67) had its structure established as the diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR data that are in agreement with reported data [37]. Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity 148 M. B. C. Gallo et al. Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151 © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Aphidicolin also may damage a fragile site of the mammalian genome [38, 39]. How- ever, it is a valuable tool to study eukaryotic DNA syn- thesis and cell cycles. P. betae (SS84) EaL fraction actually showed maximal efficacy against all the three cancer cell lines and was Table 3.

In liquid potato- sucrose medium, P. betae is reported to produce an as- sortment of bioactive diterpenes [40, 41], including ap- hidicolin (3), an specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resul- tant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1H NMR techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only compound 2 was isolated corroborating the initial low activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day cultures yielded compound 6, which was identified as dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines tested. The subfraction 1H NMR spectrum revealed a mixture of two substances in a 1:1 ratio, later separated and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3- one (compound 4) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl- isocoumarin (compound 5) in accordance with literature data (Fig. 4) [43, 44]. When compounds 4 and 5 were tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities, respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound 4 against other tumor cell lines had been previously described [45, 46] but the results in this report suggest that isocoumarin (compound 5) and ergosteroid (com- pound 4) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating or improving either the therapeutic effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs [47, 48] or radiotherapy [49]. Our results suggest that compounds 4 and 5 might be considered as hits for drug development of a novel anti- cancer combination therapy. The amounts of pesticides employed in S. sonchifolius cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes P. betae and N. sphaerica and their host have similar biosynthetic path- ways [52, 53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). N. spha- erica is also known to cause both reduction of spore ger- mination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic fungi, i.e, Fusarium oxysporum [55, 56], one of the isolated endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore, maintenance of N. sphaerica and P. betae as endophytes seems to be an ecological benefit to S. sonchifolius.

The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artiﬁcial diet at 1 mg g−1 and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superﬁcial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g−1. Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic S. densiﬂora extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from V. polygama were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, ﬂavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition. 2006 Society of Chemical Industry Keywords: Tarum˜a; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; Vitex polygama; Siphoneugena densiﬂora; Spodoptera frugiperda; botanical insecticide; pest control 1 INTRODUCTION With a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efﬁcacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3 Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noc- tuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important ﬁeld crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by con- suming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4 Of the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, Vitex polygama Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5–9 This plant is commonly called ‘Maria-Preta’, ‘Tarum˜a’, ‘Congonha-cinco-folhas’ and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, Siphoneugena densiﬂora Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in S˜ao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named ‘Uvatinga’,13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack. ∗Correspondence to: Margareth BC Gallo, Departamento de Qu´ımica, Universidade Federal de S ˜ao Carlos (UFSCar), CP 676, 13565-905, S ˜ao Carlos-SP, Brazil E-mail: marejor@uol.com.br †This paper was given in part at the XX Brazilian Congress of Entomology, Gramado-RS-Brazil, 5-10 September 2004, Abstract EN-335, p. 341.

Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 General Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, J 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethanol) from Aldrich Chemi- cal Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck- Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei M¨unchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low- resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple- quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectropho- tometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pel- lets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Aus- tralia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 × 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70–230 or 230–400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), SephadexLH-20 (25–100 µm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7(Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled. 2.2 Plants Vitex polygama and Siphoneugena densiﬂora were collected in July 2000, in the city of Po¸cos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, Brazil, respectively. 2.3 Extraction and isolation The powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after ﬁltration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 ◦C. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 × 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting ﬁltrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1. Compounds 1 to 43 were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (1, 9, 14 to 18, 25, 26 and 43; see Fig. 1) are described below. Some of them, like compounds 15 and 16, were isolated from more than one different extract of the same plant. 2.3.1 Isolation of compounds 13 to 19 from Siphoneugena densiﬂora (SD-EMR layer) A quantity of 9 g of SD-EMR (Table 1) was subjected to CC using silica gel (38.0 × 5.0 cm) with dichloromethane + ethyl acetate (7 + 3 by volume) as eluent and gradient elution.

Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with methanol. A total of 23 fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven fractions (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase methanol, ﬂowrate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield compound 1 (ﬁrst peak, 5.5 mg) and substances 7 and 8, identiﬁed as a mixture, (second peak, 3.1 mg), after three cycles of 54 min. 2.3.5 Isolation of compounds 9 to 11 from Vitex polygama (VP-EMT layer) A quantity of 1.9 g and 900 mg of VP-EMT layer (Table 1) were submitted to column chromatogra- phy (3.0 × 46.0 cm) using SephadexLH-20 and methanol as eluent. A total of 23 fractions of 50 mL were collected. Similar fractions were combined, yield- ing seven fractions (EMT1 to EMT7). Fraction 3 (EMT3, 551.0 mg) was rechromatographed over sil- ica gel (230–400 mesh) using gradient elution from ethyl acetate + dichloromethane (9 + 1 by volume) to methanol; 60 fractions of 50 mL were obtained and combined into 17 fractions (EMT3a to EMT3r). Frac- tion 5 (EMT3e, 140.5 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative TLC on silica gel 60 F254 with double development, using dichloromethane + acetone (1 + 1 by volume) as mobile phase and UV detection, yielding com- pounds 9 (77.7 mg), 10 (11.0 mg) and 11 (14.3 mg) respectively. 2.4 Insect rearing Larvae of S. frugipereda used in the experiments were obtained from cultures at the Departamento de Entomologia, Fitopatologia e Zoologia Agr´ıcola of the Escola Superior de Agronomia Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo (ESALQ/USP), and maintained in environmental chambers at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod. The artiﬁcial diet used for the bioassay and previously described22 contained cooked ‘carioca’ bean 37.5 g, 1076 Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) DOI: 10.1002/ps Natural products active against S. frugiperda wheat germ 30.0 g, soy meal 15.0 g, casein 15.0 g, yeast extract 18.75 g, tetracycline 56.5 mg, agar 11.5 g, Vanderzant vitamin mixture for insects 4.5 mL, ascorbic acid 1.8 g, sorbic acid 0.9 g, methyl p- hydroxybenzoate 1.5 g, formaldehyde (40% v/v) 1.8 mL and distilled water 600 mL, in a total volume of 720 mL. 2.5 Toxicity bioassays by ingestion against Spodoptera frugiperda 2.5.1 Crude extracts and layers A quantity of 100 mg of crude extracts or fractions was diluted in a small volume of acetone (e.g. 2 mL) along with ascorbic acid (ingredient of the artiﬁcial diet). The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg g−1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 × 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 ◦C), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot’s formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 × 6.0 cm) containing ﬁlter paper at the bottom (4.0 × 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10–20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence. The control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls. 2.5.2 Isolated compounds Four well plates (24 × 1.5 mL wells) were ﬁlled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar ﬂow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 µL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artiﬁcial congealed diet. The ﬁnal concentration was about 0.1 mg g−1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar S. frugiperda larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbott’s formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound. 2.6 Statistical analysis Data consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment means were established by Tukey’s test.24 Results are given in the text as probability values, with P < 0.05 adopted as the criterion of signiﬁcance. Complete statistical analysis was performed by means of the SAS program.25 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Structure elucidation Substances 1 to 43 were identiﬁed by comparison of their NMR, MS, UV and IR spectroscopic data with data previously reported in the literature.

S. densiﬂora polar extracts (SD-ML, SD-HAL, SD- MS, SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, SD- HAR) were responsible for the highest mortalities (100%), followed by VP-HAL (60%), VP-HF (90%) and VP-HAF (100%) extracts from Vitex polygama, taking into account the treatment period (Table 2). They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid–liquid partition. Partition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD- AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2). The VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of Vitex madiensis caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in S. frugiperda.30 Ecdysteroids 9 to 12 (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract. Flavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufﬁcient amounts to be bioassayed. The ﬂavonoids quercetin (25) and quercitrin (26) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (25) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450- dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione S-transferases from S. frugiperda.35 In addition, quercitrin (26), a ﬂavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not signiﬁcantly different (P < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound 17, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity. 3.3 Developmental effects In general, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP- HL and VP-HF, which showed signiﬁcantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage. Compound 9, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statis- tically signiﬁcant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (P < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmen- tal stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result. Although the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds 14 and 43 (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins 15 and 17 were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea- Bulla et al.,38 gallic acid (13), the compound isolated from several extracts of S. densiﬂora and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound 14, signiﬁcantly reduces larval growth of S. frugiperda at 1 mg g−1. 4 CONCLUSIONS Polar extracts from S. densiﬂora and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efﬁcient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of S. frugiperda. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin 14 along with the insecticidal effects of ﬂavonoids 25 and 26 might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound 14 might be acting synergistically with 43, and in concert with daucosterol (19), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid 13 and other Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) 1079 DOI: 10.1002/ps MBC Gallo et al. compound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.

DOI: 10.1002/ptr.1249 and could hence play a role in the defense of the organism against oxidative stress (Gordon, 1996; Pietta, 2000). Reactivity of ﬂavonoids has been studied under many experimental conditions and towards several free radicals. These investigations have demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of ﬂavonoids is mainly due to radical scavenging properties (Cotelle et al., 1996; Nanjo et al., 1996). In addition, the antioxidant activity of a compound depends ultimately on its ease of oxidation and, for a variety of natural or synthetic compounds, good correlations have been observed between antioxi- dant activities and low oxidation potentials (Born et al., 1996; Chevion et al., 2000). The present work deals with the isolation and identiﬁcation of ﬂavonoids from M. aquifolium, which have inhibited the bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates, and the evaluation of para- meters related to the antioxidant activity by separately measuring their oxidation potentials through cyclic voltammetry and the free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl). MATERIALS AND METHODS General experimental procedures. Silica gel (Merck, 230–400 and 70–230 Mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) were used for column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 or Varian INOVA 500 spectrometers at 200 or 500 MHz, respectively, for 1H NMR, and at 50 or 125 MHz, respectively, for 13C NMR, with TMS as internal standard and DMSO-d6 or MeOH-d4 as solvent. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer.

They were isolated and identiﬁed as epigallocatechin (1), (+) ouratea-catechin (2), proanthocyanidin (3), kaempferol 3-O-ααααα-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1→6)-O-[βββββ-D-glucopyranosyl (1→3)-O-ααααα-L-rhamnopyranosyl- (1→2)]-O-βββββ-D-glucopyranosyl (4) and quercetin 3-O-ααααα-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1→6)-O-[βββββ-D-glucopyranosyl (1→3)-O-ααααα-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)]-O-βββββ-D-glucopyranosyl (5). The isolates were investigated for their redox properties using cyclic voltammetry and for their radical scavenging abilities through spectrophotometric assay on the reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-pycryl hydrazyl (DPPH). These results were correlated to the inhibition of βββββ-carotene bleaching on TLC autographic assay and to structural features of the ﬂavonoids. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION In the course of our systematic studies on the chemis- try of Maytenus species, we have investigated Maytenus aquifolium Martius (Celastraceae), a tree widely dis- tributed in Cerrado region of Brazil. The infusion of M. aquifolium leaves is one of the most popular antiulcer traditional drugs in Brazil (Carlini, 1988) and its effectiveness has been proved in ethanol and/or indomethacin-induced gastric lesion models (Bersani- Amado et al., 2000; Vilegas et al., 1999). Our previous studies on M. aquifolium were carried out on its leaves and root barks and showed the presence of sesq- uiterpene pyridine alkaloids, quinonemethide and friedelane triterpenes (Corsino et al., 1998a; 1998b; 2000). On the other hand, nothing has been reported on the antioxidant properties of the constituents of M. aquifolium. TLC analysis using β-carotene as a spray reagent (Pratt and Miller, 1984) revealed the presence of anti- oxidant compounds in the MeOH extract of the leaves and root bark of M. aquifolium. Their isolation and identiﬁcation as catechins and ﬂavonol glycosides were subsequently undertaken. Flavonoids are acknowledged as having interesting medicinal properties as anti- inﬂammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor activities and are by far the most comprehensively investigated natural products when considering anti- oxidative properties. They are widely distributed in food 914 J. CORSINO ET AL. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytother. Res. 17, 913–916 (2003) obtained on Nicolet and Lambda 14P Perkin Elmer spectrophotometers, respectively. Plant Material. Leaves and root bark of Maytenus aquifolium Martius were collected from a private culture in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo and identiﬁed by Dr Rita Maria de Carvalho. A voucher specimen (number HPM0268) is deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP), São Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation. Dried and powdered leaves of M. aquifolium (4.5 kg) were extracted with ethanol. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concen- trated in vacuum to afford a green gum (896.7 g). The EtOAc soluble part of the EtOH extract (5.3 g) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (300.0 g), eluted with MeOH to give 30 fractions. Fraction 13 (0.234 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300.0 g) and eluted with CHCl3/MeOH gradient to give 10 fractions. Frac- tions 7 and 17 were identiﬁed as compounds 2 (0.089 g) and 3 (0.139 g), respectively. The methanol insoluble part of the EtOH extract (2.0 g) was submitted to Sephadex LH 20 column (100.0 g) eluted with MeOH to give 35 fractions. Fraction 10 was applied to a polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) column (6.0 g) eluted with MeOH to afford 15 fractions, yielding 4 (0.093 g) and 5 (0.034 g) as pure compounds. The dried and pow- dered root bark of Maytenus aquifolium (925.2 g) was extracted with EtOH and concentrated to give a brown gum (17.4 g). The EtOAc soluble part of this extract (2.2 g) was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (100.0 g) and eluted with MeOH to give 30 fractions. Fraction 14 was identiﬁed as compound 1 (0.017 g). Bleaching experiments on βββββ-carotene. After develop- ing and drying, TLC plates were sprayed with a 0.02% solution of β-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of back- ground. The remaining yellow spots indicated the pres- ence of antioxidant substances (Pratt and Miller, 1984). Spectrophotometric assay on the reduction of 2,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical. Reaction mixtures containing test samples (dissolved in MeOH) at several concentrations and 0.004% DPPH methanolic solutions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured using a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer at 517 nm and the percent in- hibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH treated control group (Cuendet et al., 1997). Electrochemical assay. The cyclic voltammograms were carried out with a Polarecord E-506 (Metrohm) potentiostat. A three electrode system (663 VA, Metrohm) with a working electrode of glassy carbon (GC), a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a carbon auxiliary electrode was used. DMF (Merck) was used as solvent and tetra-n-butyl ammonium tetraﬂuorborate (Merck), as the supporting electrolyte. Rutin (Aldrich) was used as reference compound for its well known electron-reductive properties [Van Acker et al., 1996; Peyrat-Maillard et al., 2000]. The working electrode was polished with aluminium oxide 0.3 µ (Buehler) and spe- cial polishing cloth (Buehler) prior to each measure- ment, because formation of a polymeric ﬁlm inactivated the electrode after each scan. The electrode was then washed thoroughly with water, dried and cycled several times in the range – 1.6 to + 0.6 V in order to reassure the absence of voltammetric signal due to the supporting electrolyte. Each compound was dissolved to concentrations of 10–20 mM in DMF and added to a 15 mL aliquot of the supporting electrolyte. The solu- tions were then deoxygenated with nitrogen for 10 min and the cyclic voltammograms were carried out at scan rates of 50, 100 or 200 mV/s. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Dried leaves and root barks were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. TLC analysis of the crude extract using β-carotene solution as spray reagent (Pratt and Miller, 1984) revealed the presence of antioxidant compounds. Chromatographic fractionation of this ex- tract guided by the antioxidant assay with β-carotene afforded ﬂavan-3-ols 1–3 and ﬂavonol glycosides 4 and 5 (Fig. 1). Their identiﬁcation was based on spectro- metric data, mainly MS, uni and bidimensional NMR techniques as well as comparison with literature data (Vilegas et al., 1999; Agrawal and Bansen, 1989). Spe- ciﬁc information on the identity of sugar moieties, including sterochemical aspects, and their position of linkage to the aglycone and to other sugar units fol- lowed from extensive analyses of PND and DEPT 135° 13C NMR, HMBC spectra as well as from analyses of coupling constants of the anomeric hydrogen signals on the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 4 and 5. Antioxidative properties of ﬂavonoids 1–5 were evalu- ated against β-carotene (Pratt and Miller, 1984). Com- pounds 1–3 and 5 (10 µg) appeared as yellow spots against the TLC plate white background whereas com- pound 4 (10 µg) appeared as a pale-yellow spot owing to its weaker antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of ﬂavonoids is due to the presence of struc- tural features as ortho-dihydroxy groups (usually on B ring), α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and α- and/or β-hydroxyketone groups, which are responsible for chelating properties or enhancement of the radicalar stabilization after the initial oxidation steps (Bors et al., 1990). The lack of a catechol moiety on B ring and a free hydroxy group at C-3 in ﬂavonol 4 may account for its low ability to protect β-carotene from bleaching and for the higher oxidation potential observed on its cyclic voltammogram when compared to compound 5 (Table 1). These structural features should also be pre- dictive of the poor radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonol 4, when compared to ﬂavan-3-ols 1–3 and to Table 1.

Radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonoids 1–5 and standard compound rutin. which are believed to be the major electrochemically active groups in these compounds. The absence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety conjugated to the B ring accounts for their higher oxidation potential when compared to compounds 4 and 5. The presence of a 4-oxo function on ﬂavonol 4 gave rise to a β-hydroxy ketone group which probably enhances the ease of ﬂavonoid oxidation, resulting in the oxidation peak at + 0.48 V on its cyclic voltammogram. These struc- tural features, in addition to the catechol moiety on the B ring of ﬂavonol 5, conferred the highest stabil- ization ability for this quercetin derivative, resulting in the lowest oxidation potential (+ 0.30V) among ﬂavonoids 1–5. The association of antioxidant and antiulcer activi- ties evidencing gastroprotective effect of antioxidants after stress-induced oxidative damage on gastric mucosa has been demonstrated by several means: through in- duction of anti-lipoperoxidative processes, enhancement of free-radical scavenging and antioxidant enzymes (e.g. glutathione peroxidase: GSH-Px) activity and/or reduc- tion of the main sources of oxygen radicals in such systems, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) (Osakabe et al., 1998; La Casa et al., 2000). Antioxidant-rich fractions (e.g. polyphenols) from plant extracts have been extensively used in experi- mental models to prove their inhibitory effect on induced ulceration. (Osakabe et al., 1998; Vilegas et al., 1999). Pure compounds have also been submitted to antiulcer activity evaluation. The protective effect of rutin, a widespread ﬂavonol glycoside, against ethanol- induced gastric lesions as well as the inhibition of gastric H+, K+ – ATPase by catechins have already been assessed (Murakami et al., 1992; La Casa et al., 2000). The quantiﬁcation of ﬂavonoids in M. aquifolium has been recently performed and showed that ﬂavonols are the major compounds, representing ca 7.6% of the dry EtOH extract (Leite et al., 2001). The presence of sig- niﬁcant amounts of antioxidant hydrosoluble ﬂavonoids in the leaves of Maytenus aquifolium may therefore consist evidence for the efﬁciency of its infusion as an antiulcer agent and legitimate its ethnopharmacological use.

The fungus led to the formation of a different product through an unusual epoxidation reaction between C4 and C5, formation of a C3,C10 ether bridge, and a methoxylation of the C1 of tagitinin C. The chemical structure of the product, namely 1b-methoxy-3a-hydroxy- 3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobutyroyloxygermacr-11(13)-en- 6a,12-olide, is the same as that of a derivative that was recently isolated from the ﬂowers of a Brazilian population of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia), which is the source of the substrate tagitinin C. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the substrate and the biotransformed product were evaluated in HL-60 cells using an MTT assay, and both compounds were found to be cytotoxic. We show that soil fungi may be useful in the biotransformation of ses- quiterpene lactones, thereby leading to unusual changes in their chemical structures that may preserve or alter their biological activities, and may also mimic plant biosynthetic pathways for production of secondary metabolites.

They are considered chemical markers within the family and have ecological as well as economic value [10, 37]. Moreover, STLs exhibit an array of interesting biological activities such as antimicrobial [5], cytostatic [25], and antifeedant activities [30]. They are the main active con- stituents of many medicinal plants of Asteraceae world- wide [32]. Tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) is an important STL occurring in the glandular trichomes of the leaves and inﬂorescences of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia Hemsl. A. Gray, Asteraceae) [2]. It shows cytotoxic [19], anti-inﬂammatory [33], and antifeedant activities [2], and thus is a promising compound for further research into its mechanisms of action in different targets. T. diversifolia, the source of 1, is used in folk medicine in many countries [8, 14] and has B. A. Rocha M. T. Pupo S. Said F. B.

How- ever, there remains concern regarding the ingestion of STLs because of their toxicity [35]. An interesting approach is to obtain STL derivatives that may have lower toxic effects or improved pharmacological activities, or both. Obtaining STL analogues, however, based on classic synthetic methods is not always a straightforward proce- dure, so the biotransformation of biologically active STLs is an attractive alternative providing new derivatives whose effects should be investigated [20]. The biotransformation of organic compounds by microorganisms is considered an economically and eco- logically viable technology. In addition, it is a useful tool for the structural modiﬁcation of bioactive natural products and the study of natural product metabolism [15, 16]. Moreover, some microorganisms can transform drugs in a similar way to mammals, and the utilization of microbial systems as models which mimic the metabolism of drugs in humans has received considerable attention [7, 16]. Fungal biotransformations of naturally occurring STLs have been carried out to obtain modiﬁcations that enhance activity and/or decrease toxicity [21, 24], develop structure– activity relationships [1, 4], and establish in vitro models to predict mammalian metabolites [3, 39]. A considerable number of biotransformations of STLs have been described using fungi [29]. Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16888), for example, transformed costunolide into four main products, 1b-hydroxyarbusculin, colartin, 11,13-dihydrosantamarine, and 11,13-dihydroreynosin [20]. In the same study, A. och- raceous (CECT 2069) transformed deoxyvulgarin into two products, vulgarin and dihydrodouglanin [20]. The microbial transformation of sclareolide by A. niger (ATCC 10549) yielded four oxidized metabolites identiﬁed as 1b-hydrox- ysclareolide, 3b-hydroxysclareolide, 1a,3b-dihydroxyscla- reolide, and 1b,3b-dihydroxysclareolide [31]. The STL artemisitene was metabolized by A. niger (NRRL 599) to yield 11-epi-artemisinin, 9b-hydroxydeoxy-11-epi-arte- misinin, and 9b-hydroxy-11-epi-artemisinin [27]. Microbial transformation of the germacranolide parthenolide using A. niger (NRRL 599) and A. ochraceous (NRRL 2295) yiel- ded 11bH-dihydroparthenolide [11]. A. terreus (IFO6123) transformed dehydrocostuslactone into two derivatives, 11a,13-dihydrodehydrocostuslactone and 16-(1-methyl-1- propenyl)eremantholide [13]. Cultures of two strains of A. niger (AS 3.1858 and VKM F-1119) transformed one of the most important STLs, artemisinin,into four hydroxylated products, 3b-hydrodeoxyartemisinin, 1a-hydroxyartemisi- nin, 5b-hydroxyartemisinin, and 7b-hydroxyartemisinin [28, 39]. According to the literature, the main enzymatic reactions of STLs that are able to be catalyzed by Aspergillus Fig. 1 Proposal of biotransformation of 1 into 2 by A. terreus MT 5.3 (adapted from Spring et al. [38]) 1720 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 species are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation. Thus, with the aims of obtaining new, potentially bio- active compounds, and giving insights into the new meta- bolic reactions of STLs, we carried out the biotransformation of tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) by the fungus Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3. Materials and methods Isolation of tagitinin C (1) Leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (400 g) were collected by B. A. Rocha, in May 2007, in Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil. The material was identiﬁed by F. B. Da Costa, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the SPFR Herbarium, Depart- ment of Biology, Ribeira˜o Preto, SP, University of Sa˜o Paulo, under the number FBC #126. Air-dried entire leaves were rinsed for a few seconds with dichloromethane, for dissolution of the glandular trichomes [2], thereby yielding 5 g of a yellow crude extract after ﬁltration with common ﬁlter paper and solvent evaporation under reduced pres- sure. The dry residue was re-suspended in MeOH/H2O (7:3, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane followed by dichloromethane. After solvent evaporation, the dichloro- methane layer was fractionated over silica gel 60H (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7736) by vacuum liquid chromatography [9] using increasing amounts of ethyl acetate in n-hexane, thereby yielding nine fractions of 250 ml each. The tagi- tinin C-rich fractions (3 and 4) (1.5 g, conﬁrmed by infrared spectroscopy, TLC, and reversed-phase HPLC analysis, as well as comparison with an authentic sample [2]) were puriﬁed by centrifugal chromatography (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7749; 4 mm thickness; n-hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 6:3:1 v/v as eluent; ﬂow rate 2 ml/min; UV lamp 254 nm). For ﬁnal puriﬁcation, preparative TLC was used (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730; 1 mm thickness; n-hexane/ethyl acetate/ chloroform 5:3:2 v/v, and 2 % acetic acid as eluent). The isolated compound (1, 200 mg) was analyzed by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to check its purity before the biotransformation procedure. The 1H NMR spectral data of compounds (1 and 2) were in accordance with those reported [2]. Biotransformation procedure and analysis Screening was performed on a small scale (30 ml of fer- mentation medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) to select efﬁcient conditions for the biotransformation of 1. The trials for screening procedures were performed as previ- ously described by Krishna-Kumari et al. [17]. A. terreus MT 5.3 was cultivated in malt extract medium and incu- bated at 30 C for 7 days to obtain spores. After that, the spores were harvested using a 2 % Tween 80 aqueous solution and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. The pre-fermentative medium was inoculated with 1 9 107 spores/ml and incubated with agitation (150 rpm) at 30 C for 48 h. The resulting mycelium was harvested, rinsed with sterilized H2O, and transferred to fresh Czapek med- ium (initial pH 6.0). The culture was then incubated under the same conditions for 10 days. After 24 h, 0.1 mg/ml of 1, which had been previously dissolved in dimethyl sulf- oxide (3 mg dissolved in 300 ll), was added to the culture medium. Control ﬂasks contained culture medium with the fungus but without 1, culture medium with the fungus and dimethyl sulfoxide and without 1, culture medium with 1 and without the fungus, or only the culture medium. A time course study was carried out as follows. One Erlenmeyer ﬂask was taken every 24 h; the product was extracted with dichloromethane, and then analyzed by TLC to check the degree of transformation of compound 1. TLC was carried out on silica gel GF254 (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730) plates (0.25 mm thickness, 20 9 20 cm), and the spots were visualized after spraying the plates with vanillin/sulfuric acid (1 % H2SO4 in ethanol). Thirty milligrams of 1 was used for the preparative- scale incubation with A. terreus MT 5.3 for 120 h, at 150 rpm, and 30 C. The culture broth was ﬁltered using ﬁlter paper and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting residue (45 mg) was subjected to separation by HPLC in a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp liquid chromatograph with an SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector (Japan) using a C-18 column (Shimadzu, Japan, ODS Shim-pack 5 lm, 4.6 9 250 mm; ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min; DAD detection). The main metabolite (2, 4 mg) was puriﬁed after repe- ated injections according to the following gradient: 0.1 min 20 % MeCN, 35 min 60 % MeCN, 38 min 100 % MeCN, 43 min 100 % MeCN, 48 min 20 % MeCN, and 53 min 20 % MeCN. Compounds 1 and 2 were observed at retention times of 24 and 29 min, respectively (UV detection set at 210 nm). Comparison of the HPLC proﬁles of the controls with those bio- transformed ensured that 1 had been converted to 2 through microbial catalysis. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by HR-ESIMS, 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques, and com- parison of the spectroscopic data with an authentic sample and published data [2]. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker (Germany) DPX 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H). Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Aldrich (USA). High-resolution mass J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 1721 123 spectra were recorded on a UltrOTOFq-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Microorganism Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3 was isolated from soil in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and identiﬁed by C. M. S. Motta from ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas–Micoteca URM–Depart- amento de Micologia/CCB-UFP’’, Av. Prof. Nelson Chaves s/no., Cidade Universita´ria, 50670-420, Recife, Brazil. The fungus was maintained by periodic transfers on PDA at 8 C. The microorganism A. terreus MT 5.3 was deposited in the collection ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas Tropicais’’ (Tropical Culture Collection) of Andre´ Tosello Foundation (www. fat.org.br), under accession number CCT-7640. Cytotoxicity assay Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, as described by Mossman [23]. The MTT (Sigma, USA) solution at a ﬁnal concentration of 500 lg/ml was added to the culture medium 4 h before the end of the treatment, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide to the cell culture. For cell treatment we used compounds 1 and 2, at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 lg/ml. Non- treated culture cells were used as a negative control, and cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. Statis- tical analysis was performed by Student’s t test; and Dunnett’s test was used for multiple comparisons. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁ- cant. Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Results and discussion The transformation of 1 by A. terreus MT 5.3 yielded the unusual STL 2 as the main compound. This was identiﬁed as 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobuty- royloxygermacr-11(13)-en-6a,12-olide. The 1H NMR spectral data of 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1. Although several researchers worldwide have chemically investi- gated T. diversifolia, compound 2 was isolated only from a Brazilian population [2]. As already mentioned, it should be emphasized that the main enzymatic reactions that Aspergillus promotes in STLs are hydrogenation, hydrox- ylation, reduction, and acetylation [6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 39, 40]. Interestingly, we have uncovered an unu- sual epoxidation between C4 and C5; a methoxy group was added at C1, and a C1,C10 ether bridge was formed in the 10-membered ring of 1. Nevertheless, the exocyclic double bond at C11–C13 was preserved. Compound 2 was recently isolated from a rinse extract of the inﬂorescences of Brazilian T. diversifolia [2]. Although its chemical structure is already known, this is the ﬁrst time that 2 has been obtained as a microbial biotransformation product. An interesting observation is that the Aspergillus strain used in our work was able to catalyze chemical reactions that mimicked those which occur inside the glandular trichomes from the inﬂorescences of T. diversifolia. Glandular tric- homes of Asteraceae species are the places where the biosynthesis of STLs usually occurs, and possibly where 1 is converted to 2. Thus, this fungus can be used as an alternative means of gaining 2 from 1, therefore conﬁrming the potential of biotransformation of natural compounds by microorganisms, as well as their ability to mimic plant biosynthetic pathways [34]. Spring et al. [38] reported the isolation of a closely related analogue of 1 from Viguiera quinqueremis (Aster- aceae), and proposed its conversion to the hemiketal form, such as 1b depicted in Fig. 1. The structural differences between the previously reported analogue and 1 are the nature of the C8 side-chain ester (methylbutyrate instead of isobutyrate) and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C15. The authors also discussed a spontaneous methoxylation of the 1a analogue at C1 in the presence of MeOH, thereby leading to the formation of an analogue of 1b (Fig. 1) [38]. Thus, it could be argued in our work that 2 is a compound produced by A. terreus starting from 1b, an artifact that had Table 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1 and 2 (500 MHz, CDCl3, J in Hz) H 1 2 1 6.93 d (16.9) 3.99 dd (6.7, 10.4) 2a 6.26 d (16.9) 2.57 dd (6.7, 12.5) 2b – 1,93 dd (10.7, 12.6) 5 5.88 d (9.0) 3.33 s 6 5.41 d (9.0) 5.13 dd (4.65) 7 3.55 m 4.33 dddd 8 5.33 ddd (3.2, 6.0, 10.0) 5.53 ddd (4.2; 7.1, 11.0) 9a 2.40 dd (6.0, 13.8) 1.74 dd (11.1, 14.7) 9b 2.00 dd (10.0, 13.8) 1.66 dd (4.8, 14.7) 13a 6.36 d (1.7) 6.29 dd (2.8) 13b 5.81 d (1.8) 5.62 dd (2.3) 14 1.53 s 1.50 s 15 1.95 s 1.44 s 20 2.44 sept 2.41 sept 30 1.06 d (7.1) 1.05 d (7.0) 40 1.03 d (7.1) 1.04 d (7.0) –OMe – 3.35 s 1722 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 originated from 1 in the presence of MeOH. Nevertheless, a spontaneous interconversion where 1 was converted to 1b would never occur in methods such as ours, because MeOH was not used in any step of the experimental procedure, either for isolation, analysis, or structure elucidation of 1. Compound 2 is therefore a natural product obtained by biotransformation of 1. In addition, the crude extract from the leaves of T. diversifolia used in this work had been screened for the presence of 2 by HPLC–DAD analysis, and it was not detected even as a trace. According to Barrero et al. [6], epoxidation and hydro- genation reactions of the exocyclic double bond at C11– C13 seem to be the most common processes in the microbial transformation of STLs by ﬁlamentous fungi. In order to explain the formation of the epoxide group between C4 and C5 in the biotransformed molecule 2 as well as the methoxylation of C1, we followed the proposal of Onken and Berger [26]. The authors state that terpenoids are preferentially dissolved in the cell membranes of fungi, thereby inducing changes in properties of the membrane and causing toxicity. Fungi react against these effects and co-metabolize compounds to others that are more water soluble, thus showing that the enzyme systems involved in this process of detoxiﬁcation are comparable to those of other eukaryotic cells. In the ﬁrst step, monooxygenases of cytochrome P450 catalyze the oxyfunctionalization of the molecules [12, 22]. Then, in the second step, more water- soluble products are formed by the action of hydrolases or conjugation by glutathione S-transferases [6, 12]. Thus, the biotransformation of 1 leading to 2 might be part of a detoxiﬁcation process created by the fungus. The cytotoxicity bioassay was designed to observe whether 1 and 2 could elicit cell death at the selected concentrations. Both compounds showed cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells lines comparable to that of the positive control, which was statistically signiﬁcant when compared with the negative control (p \\ 0.05). The results indicated that 1 and 2 have cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells at the lowest tested doses. Similar results were found while using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where 1 and 2 also presented cytotoxic effects, thus indicating non- selective toxicity. It has previously been shown that 1 has cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells [19], but its activity has not yet been compared with that of the derivative 2. In the same work, compound 1b was isolated from T. diver- sifolia as a natural compound and was found to be approximately 10 times more active than 1. In our work, compound 2, a C4–C5 epoxy derivative of 1b, had a sta- tistically similar activity to 1. Kupchan et al. [18] demonstrated that the in vitro cytotoxicity of STLs against human carcinoma was dependent on the presence of the a-methylene-c-lactone moiety. Moreover, evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of further derivatives indicated which functional groups con- tributed to the activity. So-called active functional groups have therefore been proposed for several STLs. It has been veriﬁed, for example, that an extra a,b-unsaturated moiety contributed to enhancing the activity of STLs with the a-methylene-c-lactone group, whereas the compounds containing only this additional unsaturation did not present signiﬁcant activity [18]. In another study, it was conﬁrmed that among other structural and electronic factors, the a,b- unsaturated carbonyl structure elements (cyclopentenone and a-methylene-c-lactone) are correlated with cytotoxicity [36]. In our work, compound 1, containing three a,b- unsaturated moieties, had statistically similar activity to 2, with only one a,b-unsaturated moiety. This suggested therefore that its extra unsaturations were not important to the effect observed in HL-60 cells. In summary, we have observed that in the presence of compound 1, enzymes from A. terreus MT 5.3 were able to generate 2 in the same way as the enzymes located in the glandular trichomes of T. diversifolia. This fungus can thus be used as an alternative source of 2 because it mimics plant biosynthetic processes. The absence of two a,b- unsaturations in 2 did not improve or decrease its cytotoxic activity in the HL-60 cells when compared with 1. Finally, we suggest that the mammalian metabolism of 1 after oral consumption of preparations containing T. diversifolia leaves should be researched in future, because this STL may form toxic compounds when metabolized.

Abstract-Five amides were isolated from the roots of Ottonia corcouadensis. Two are the known piperlonguminine and piperovatine. The other three are new and their structures are: (2Z,4Z)-N-isobutyl-5-(3,4_methylenedioxyphenyl)- penta-2,4-dienoic amide for isopiperlonguminine; (2E,4E)-N-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methylenedioxy- phenyl)-penta-2,4-dienoic amide for corcovadine; and (22,4Z)-N-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)~penta-2,4-dienoic amide for isocorcovadine. INTRODUCTION Ottonia corcovadensis Miq., a herbaceous shrub of the Piperaceae, is known in Brazilian folk medicine under the name of ‘false jaborandi’.* Its roots and, to a lesser extent, the stems are chewed to alleviate toothache, due to their anesthetic action on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Extraction of the roots with petrol followed by extensive column chromatography yielded five amides. Piperlonguminine (1) and piperovatine (5) were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples. Piperovatine is the sole substance responsible for the anesthetic activity and was obtained pure by crystallization in a system of solvents at low temperature. The remaining three amides are new, having been named isopiperlonguminine (2), corcovadine (3) and isocorcovadine (4). Piperlonguminine-isopiperlongu- minine and corcovadine-isocorcovadine are shown to be pairs of cis-tram isomers. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The work was performed with two batches of roots of 0. corcouadensis collected at the same site with a 1 year interval. Different extraction procedures were applied to the two batches. In the first process the ground roots were extracted exhaustively with petrol at room temperature; the resulting oily extract was fractionated on a column of silica gel and fractions eluted with solvents of increasing polarity. Piperlonguminine (1) and corcovadine (3) were isolated in this way. With the second batch, extraction was done in a Soxhlet, the extract being chromatographed repeatedly on a series of silica gel columns. By this procedure, all five amides could be isolated. Separation on silica gel proved to be effective, although extremely delicate due to the closeness of the bands. All five amides were eluted with hexane-EtOAc mixtures of composition close to 7:3, thus calling for frequent rechromatography of *Not to be confused with the genuine jaborandi, comprising several Pilocarpus species (family Rutaccae), the source of pilocarpine and other alkaloids. = CH-CH =CH-CONHCH,CHMe, 1 tram-2-tram-4 2 cis-2-cis-4 CH = CH-CH = CHCONHCH,CMe,OR 3 tram-2-truns-4, R = AC 4 cis-2-cis-4, R = AC 6 trans-2-truns-4, R = H -5 :I CH,CH = CH-CH = CHCONHCH,CHMe, Me0 5 the fractions. Most difficult to isolate pure was piperovatine (5). Its presence was monitored through the procedure by means of its anesthetizing action on the tongue. Several attempts to purify the active fractions were unsuccessful due mainly to their pronounced tendency to darken. The final purification was achieved again through chromatography on a silica gel column and elution with mixtures of hexane and EtOAc. At the end, the compound crystallized after being kept for 11 weeks at - 5”. The pair piperlonguminine-isopiperlonguminine Piperlonguminine (I), the isobutylamide of trans,trans- piperic acid, was originally isolated from the roots ofPiper longum [l 1. Isopiperlonguminine (2), C,,H,,O,N, 1305 1306 S. S. COSTA and W. B. MORS crystals, mp l&143”, is herewith described as the corresponding cis,cis isomer. The mass spectra of the compounds are identical; IR and UV spectra are similar. The IR spectra differ notably at 985 cm-‘, where only 1 shows a strong absorption peak due to the tram configuration. Comparison of the UV spectra shows essentially a hypsochromic shift of the main absorption band, of the order of 10 nm. Significant differences appear in the ‘H NMR spectra, where signals in the region of the olefinic protons appear much less complex for 2 than for 1 (see Table 1). The positions of the signals agree with those reported for synthetic cis,cis-piperic acid [2] and for cis,cis- piperine (chavicine) [3]. Doubts about the precise assignments for protons B and C [3] could be dispelled with the aid of the ‘spin tickling’ technique of double resonance. Irradiating the proton corresponding to the most upfield signal (HA, d 5.69, d, J = 11 Hz) determines splitting of the signal at d 6.85 (t, J = 11 Hz), which must therefore be assigned to Ha. Conversely, irradiation of the most downfield signal (presumably the deshielded H,, (6 7.45, t, J = 11 Hz) determines splitting of two signals, as would have to be expected, one being due to H, (already identified) and the other one H, (S 4.66, d, J = 11 Hz). The observed differences between the spectra of the isomers with respect to the protons fl to the amide carbonyl group are consistent in that the uniform shielding in the trarqtrans structures suffers a deshielding effect in the cis,cis structures. The pair corcovadine-isocorcovadine Corcovadine (3), C,,H,,O,N, crystals, mp 141-144”, exhibits the typical UV absorptions of a piperic acid derivative (see Experimental). The IR spectrum is similar to that of piperlonguminine with respect to the amide function (v,,, 3225 and 1640 cm- I), the trans configura- tion of the olefinic double bonds (lOOOcm_ ‘) and the methylenedioxy group (925 cm - ‘). A second carbonyl function is revealed by a strong absorption at 1710 cm - I, which can be attributed to the presence of an acetoxy group. The ‘H NMR spectrum also very much resembles that of piperlonguminine with respect to the piperic acid moiety (see Table 1). In addition, there are signals for geminal methyl groups (6H, s) at S 1.46; methylene protons (2H, d, J = 6Hz) at 5 3.59, coupled with the proton at the nitrogen (1 H, br.), at 6 6.23. A single signal (3H, s) at 62.02 is again indicative of an acetoxy group, which was also confirmed by the mass spectrum: with a fragmentation pattern similar to that of piperlongu- minine, it shows an additional significant peak at m/z 271 (M + - 60; 14 y’,), corresponding to the loss of one acetic acid molecule from the molecular ion. Other fragments were typical of amides derived from piperic acid. On the basis of these data, structure 3 was assigned to corcovadine. Chemical confirmation was obtained through alkaline hydrolysis, producing the amide 6, with a tertiary hydroxyl group, and piperic acid. Spectral comparisons analogous to those discussed for piperlonguminine and isopiperlonguminine allowed for correlation of corcovadine (3) with its isomer, isocorcovadine (4), C,,H, ,05N, crystals, mp 80-85”. The absence, in the IR spectrum of the latter, of an absorption in the region of 970-990cm -’ points to the absence of double bonds in a trans configuration. The cis configuration receives support from similarities in the UV and ‘H NMR spectra to those of isopiperlonguminine (2) (see Table 1 and Experimental). Mass spectral fragmentations of 3 and 4 are identical. EXPERIMENTAL Mps were determined on a Kofler hot stage and are uncorr. UV spectra were obtained in MeOH and IR spectra in KBr unless otherwise stated. ‘HNMR spectra were measured at 100MHz and MS at 70eV. Column chromatography was performed on Si gel, and TLC on Si gel H and GF,,, (Merck). The identity of compounds, whenever stated, was established by direct comparison with authentic samples through mp, mmp, UV, IR, ‘HNMR and MS, as well as TLC. Plant material. Two batches of 0. corcovadensis were collected at the hillside of the Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, in December, at a 1 year interval.

The dried, powdered roots (1600g) were exhaustively extracted by maceration with petrol. The combined extracts (22 1.) were coned under red. pres. to give a dark green viscous mass (7.7Og). The material was treated with Me,CO and the soluble portion was again evapd to dryness under red. pres. The dark oily residue (5.86g) was cbromatographed on a Si gel column (350g) and developed with solvent mixtures of increasing polarity. Toluene-EtOAc (19: 1) eluted piperlongumine (1, 36 mg). Elution with toluene-EtOAc 9:l and 4:l afforded fractions which were combined and submitted to the same procedure. Repeated chromatography followed by five recrystallizations from MeOH yielded corcovadine (3, 58mg). Although these last fractions were strongly anesthetizing to the tongue, separation of the active material could not be achieved. Extraction and separation II. The dried, powdered roots (19OOg) were extracted with petrol in a Soxhlet until the extract was clear (72 hr.) The filtered extract was coned under red. pres., yielding a dark green viscous oil (22g). The material was chromatographed on a column of Si gel (300g) and developed first with hexane, followed by solvent mixtures of increasing polarity, through toluene, EtOAc and MeOH. This procedure resulted in the separation of four crude fractions, of which only one, the one eluted with EtOAc, showed anesthetic activity. The fractions were repeatedly rechromatographed, monitoring the procedure by means of TLC. In this, visualization of all the compounds in UV light was very helpful: the tram compounds showed intense, blue fluorescence, while the cis compounds were detached from the background as dark spots. Eventually, all five amides were separated in this way. Solvents for crystallization were: toluene for piperlonguminine; hexane-EtOAc (2:l) for isopiperlonguminine; MeOH for corcovadine; hexane-EtOAc (4:l) for isocorcovadine; MeOH for piperovatine. All were obtained as colourless crystals. Piperionguminine (1). Mp 167-169” (lit. [l ] 166-168”). IR v,,,cm-‘: 3280, 1640,1615,1550, 1495, 1470, 1430,1360,1240, 1185, 1030, 985, 920, 850.

Abstract-A hydroalcoholic extract of the leaves of Alibertia macrophylla afforded the esters of caffeic acid and 2-phenylethanol or 2-methyl butane-1,4-diol. The leaves also contain cafleic acid. The acetone extract of the stems of A. macrophyllu contain a-amyrin, /?-amyrin, a-amyrenone, /I-amyrenone, lupeol, lupenone and germanicone. Struc- tural assignments were taken through spectral data analysis and physical properties. This is the first report on the chemistry of Alibertia. INTRODUCTION The economic and therapeutic importance of many species of Rubiaceae is well known in Brazil, where this family includes representatives belonging to 125 genera [ 11. The region of Sgo Paulo has ca 204 registered species; they are herbs, shrubs or trees growing in the forest and ‘cerrado’ [l J. Alibertia mucrophylla K. Schum was of interest for phytochemical studies as the presence of fungitoxic constituents in a polar extract of its leaves has been shown [2, 33, also, no previous studies of Alibertia have been undertaken. We report the isolation of caffeic acid and two of its esters from the leaves of A. macro- phylla. We have also examined the stems of this species: a-amyrin, /?-amyrin, a-amirenone, /I-amirenone, lupeol, lupenone and germanicone were isolated and identified. The structural assignments for the two new natural derivatives of caffeic acid are presented and discussed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The hydroalcoholic extract prepared from the leaves of A. macrophylla showed, when submitted to TLC and bioassay with Cladosporium sphaerospermum, the pres- ence of three zones of inhibition at R, 0.22,0.36 and 0.65 [43. By a combination of partition into solvent systems and chromatographic methods la-c were isolated from a 40% ethanol extract. The spectral properties of lb and c showed these substances as esters of caffeic acid. A molecular ion peak at m/z 284 was found for lb (CI,H,604) and at m/z 266 for lc (C14H,s05). The molecular formulae were also supported by the “CNMR data (Table 1). The IR spectra of both com- pounds showed the presence of a&unsaturated ester carbonyl (1695, 1630cn-‘), aromatic rings (1610 and 1520 cm - ’ and of hydroxyl groups (335&3340 cm - ‘). The ‘H NMR spectra of la and lb indicated aromatic protons as an ABX system (Table 2) and a pattern similar to that of caffeic acid is suggested. It is significant that the values summarized in Table 2 are in good agreement with those published for calTeic acid and its derivatives [S-8]. The main differences between lb and c seem to be related to the alcoholic portion of the esters and were clearly shown by ‘H and 13CNMR data. For lb, the presence of a second aromatic ring bearing a two carbon lateral chain was suggested: the ‘H NMR spectra showed a broad singlet (SH) at 67.24 and two triplets at 62.64 (J = 7.5 Hz) and 3.68 (J = 7.5 Hz) which can respect- ively be assigned to the benzilic and to the carbinolic protons of a 2-phenylethoxy unit. For le. the following features were deduced from ‘H NMR: the signals at 64.00 and 3.86 were assigned to four carbinolic protons and the doublet at 1.01 should correspond to the protons of a Table 1. “YINMR spectral data for compounds la-z at 50.0 MHz’ C In lb IC 1 2 3 4 5 6 I 8 9 1’ 2 3’ 4 5 6 7 8 127.00 s 114.90 d 149.55 s 146.72 s 115.15d 122.34 d 146.68 d 116.35 d 167.42 s 127.76 s 114.36 d 148.81 s 145.85 s 115.36 d 122.31 d 148.35 d 116.00d 168.21 s 126.56 s 128.71 d 129.83 d 139.00 d 129.83 d 128.71 d 34.32 I 60.82 t 127.20 s 115.35 d 148.81 s 145.01 s 114SOd 122.90 d 148.50 d 116.00 d 168.30 5 68.02 r 37.90 d 39.89 r 60.90 t 19.02 q - *Measured in acetone-d,.

Their identifications were based on the comparison of physical and spectral data, mainly t3CNMR 6 values, with the values reported in the literature for a-amyrin, r-amyrenone, /3-amyrin, /I?-amyr- enone, germanicone, lupeol and htpenone [l&13] respectively. EXPERIMENTAL Plant material. Alibertia macrophylla was collected in the Estafio Ecologica e Experimental de Magi-Guacu (SP), by Dr M. C. M. Young and identified by Dr Z. L. Jung-Mendacolli (Instituto de Botinica, .Sgo Paulo). Extraction and isolation of constituents. Dried and powdered leaves (314g) of A. macrophylla were extracted with 40% EtOH-HzO. The extract, dissolved in MeGH-Hz0 (9: 1) was partitioned into n-hexane, HCCI, and EtOAc. The EtOAc solubles (2 g) were resolved by CC (silica gel. HCCI,-MeOH, increasing polarity) into 22 frs. lb (23 mg) was separated from frs l-2 by prep. TLC [silica gel, n-hexancEtOAc (1: l)+O.S% HOAc]. Fr. 11 submitted to prep. TLC (silica gel, CHCI,-EtzO, 3: 1) yielded la (6.5 mg). Frs 12-18 after prep. TLC [silica gel, CHCI,-MeOH (7: 3) + 2% HOAc] afforded lc (12 mg). The acetone extract of the stems (160 g) of A. macrophylla was also examined. After partition into the system MeOH-Hz0 (9: I)-n-hexane, the hexane solubles (660 mg) submitted to prep. TLC (n-hexane_EtOAc, 4:l) led to the separation of: a- and b-amyrin (2a+Ja, 198 mg), lupeol (4a, 20 mg), lupenone (4b, 80 mg), a-amirenone (2b, 27 mg), /J-amirenone (XI, 23 mg) and germanicone (Jc, 39 mg). 2-Phenylerhyl cafleoare (lb).

Kingston a,* aDepartment of Chemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0212 blnstituto de Quimica, Universidade Estadual Paulista, CP 359, 14.800, Araraquam - SP, Brazil Abstract: Four new piperidine alkaloids, leptophyllin A (4), 3-acetylleptophyllin A (5), leptophyllin B (8). and (-)-spectaline (1), and 3 known piperidine alkaloids, (-)-spectalinine (2), canavaline (3), and iso-6-canavaline (7), were isolated by a bioassay-guided fractionation of a leaf extract of Cassia leptophylla. The alkaloids 1 - 3 were active in a inechanism-based DNA-modifying yeast assay and 2 was moderately active in Vero monkey and Chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity assays. Although piperidine alkaloids are abundant in nature and many of them are known to exhibit some biological activity, 1 to the best of our knowledge none have been reported to show any effect on DNA. In our search for potential anticancer agents employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents,2, 3 we have isolated (-)-spectaline (1), the enantiomer of the known (+)-spectaline (6), three known piperidine alkaloids, (-)-spectalinine (2), canavaline (3), and iso-6-canavaline (7) and three new piperidine alkaloids named leptophyllin A (4), 3-acetylleptophyllin A (5), and leptophyllin B (8), by a bioassay-guided fractionation of a bioactive extract of the Brazilian legume, Cassia leptophylla. Of these, (-)-spectaline (1), (-)-spectalinine (2) and canavaline (3) were found to be active in our bioassay. The alkaloids 1 and 2 also showed cytotoxicity in the Vero monkey and Chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity assays. In this paper we report the structure elucidation, the assignment of IH and 13C NMR spectral data by application of 2D techniques, and the biological evaluation of these seven piperidine alkaloids. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A preliminary investigation of the bioactive CHC13/MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of C. leptophylla indicated that the bioactivity was due to its alkaloidal constituents. Thus the alkaloidal fraction obtained in the usual manner was subjected to CC on A1203 and the resulting fractions exhibiting bioactivity were further separated by combined A1203 CC, Si gel prep TLC, and RP-TLC as necessary to afford seven alkaloids, the structures of which were elucidated as described below. All seven alkaloids exhibited some common features in their MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectra (see Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The presence of significant peaks at m/z 114 and 96 in their FABMS were characteristic of a piperidine bearing methyl, hydroxyl and alkyl functionalities. 4-6 These groups in the piperidine ring were located at C-2, C-3 and C-6, respectively, based on their 1H and 13C NMR data. 5929 5930 V. DA S. BOLZANI et aL The least polar alkaloid, C20H39NO2 (HRFABMS), [~]D - 8.2 °, in addition to the general characteristics indicated above, had a peak at m/z 265 in its MS which may be assigned to the fragment e (Table 1) suggesting that it has a C14 alkyl side chain with an oxo function, the presence of which was confirmed by its IR (Vmax 1720 cm-1), and 13C NMR (5 209.3 s) spectra. The 13C NMR spectrum, interpreted with the aid of the DEPT spectrum, indicated the presence of one quaternary C, three CH's, fourteen CH2's, and two CH3's. One of the CH3 carbons appeared at ~ 29.8 suggesting that the molecule contained a COCH3 group. From the foregoing the structure 1 was inferred for this alkaloid. The 2D NMR data (DQCOSY, HETCOR and HMBC) supported the structure 1 proposed for this alkaloid and enabled assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR signals due to the piperidine ring and some fragments of the long alkyl chain. Thus in the HETCOR spectrum, the methine signal at 6c 55.7 (C-2) correlated with the dq at 6H 2.72, whilst the methine signal at 8c 57.2 (C-6) correlated with the multiplet at ~H 2.50; the methyl signal at 8c 29.8 showed a correlation with the signal at 8rl 2.16. The HMBC spectrum showed IH-13C correlations (Fig. 1) which were useful in the assignment of 1H and 13C NMR signals of the piperidine nucleus, the C-2-Me, and some portions of the side chain. The 1H and 13C NMR assignments for 1 are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. \"R HaC'2 ~-I 6\"R2 1 R = -(CH2)I2COCH 3 4 RI = H; R2 = -(CH2)IoCH(OH)CH2OH 7 R = -(CH2)IoCH(OH)CH3 2 R = -(CH2)I2CH(OH)CH3 5 RI = Ac; R2 = -(CH2)IoCH(OH)CH2OH 8 R = -(CH2)IoCO2H 3 R = -(CH2)IoCH(OH)CH3 6 RI = H ; R2 = -(CH2)IoCOCH3 H,.

The relative configurations of the chiral carbons C-2, C-3, and C-6 in the piperidine ring of 1 were assigned mainly on the basis of 1H coupling data obtained from its 1H and DQCOSY NMR spectra and comparison of these data with those reported for related piperidines. 7 It is known that in the absence of any bulky substituents in the piperidine ring, the C-3-OH group prefers the axial orientation which allows it to form an intramolecular H-bond with the lone-pair of electrons on N. 8,9 This was reflected in the IR spectrum of 1 in CC14 which showed a large H-bonded OH stretch signal at 3350 cm -1, similar to those shown by cassine 10 and speetaline (8). 9 The 1H and 13C NMR data for 1 were almost identical with those reported for spectaline. 9 However, the [Ct]D for 1 was determined to be -8.2 ° whereas that reported for spectaline is +8.0 °, indicating that alkaloid 1 is the enantiomer of spectaline, i.e. (-)-spectaline. Comparison of the 13C NMR data for 1 with those of (+)-spectaline (8) 9 showed a discrepancy in the literature assignments for C-2, C-6, and C- 14 and these have now been revised based on HETCOR and HMBC data (see Table 2).

Alkaloid 2, C20H41NO2 (HRFABMS), [Ct]D - 8.6 °, whilst having the general spectral characteristics of a 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloid, showed peaks at m/z 267 and 249 in its MS due to the fragments f and g respectively (Table 1), suggesting the presence of a hydroxy group in the side chain. The 1H NMR spectrum was found to be similar to that reported for (-)-spectalinine. 11 As 13C NMR assignments for spectalinine have not been reported previously, spectral assignment was undertaken with the aid of HETCOR, DEPT, HMBC and COLOC techniques. 13C NMR assignments for (-)-spectalinine (2) are given in Table 3.

Spectral data (MS, 1H and 13C NMR) of the next most polar alkaloid, C18H37NO2 (HRFABMS), closely resembled those of alkaloid 2 except that they indicated that it had two fewer CH2 units in the side chain compared with 2 [MS (Table 1) and 13C NMR (Table 3) evidence]. The comparison of 1H NMR (Table 2), MS data and [Ct]D of this alkaloid with canavaline (3) 4 confirmed its identity. Spectral data for alkaloid 4, CI3H38NO3 (HRFABMS), [tX]D + 2.5 °, indicated it to be new and it was therefore named leptophyllin A. The presence of a 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-alkylpiperidine nucleus was apparent from its MS fragmentation (Table l) and IH NMR data (Table 2). The MS, in addition to the general fragments depicted in Table 1, showed two prominent peaks at m/z 284 and 254 corresponding, respectively, to the loss of CH2OH and CH(OH)CH2OH fragments from M +. The 1H NMR spectra, analyzed with the help of its DQCOSY spectrum, indicated the presence of two spin systems in addition to those due to the substituted piperidine ring, appearing at 8 3.69 m, 3.62 dd, and 3.40 dd and attributable to the side chain. Furthermore, the 13C NMR spectrum, analyzed with the aid of DEPT and HETCOR spectra, showed the presence of oxygenated methine (~C 72.2) and methylene (~2 66.8) carbons. The foregoing suggested the presence of a 1,2-glycol system at the terminus of the side chain. The presence of this system as well as the Piperidine alkaloids from Cassia leptophylla 5933 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-alkylpiperidine structural moiety was confirmed by the HMBC spectrum. The HMBC correlations observed for the side chain of 4 were similar to those observed for 5 (Fig. 1). Based on the above observations, along with analysis of its I3C NMR spectrum, leptophyllin A was identified as 2(S)-methyl 6(R)-(1 l',12'-dihydroxydodecyl)piperidin-3(S)-ol (4). The stereochemical dispositions of the groups at C-2, C-3, and C-6 in 4 were deduced from the corresponding IH NMR coupling constants.8,9 However, it was not possible to assign the configuration of C(11)-OH due to the limited quantity of 4 available. A minor alkaloid was also isolated from the crude CC fraction which contained 4. This alkaloid had tH and 13C NMR spectral characteristics similar to 4 except that it contained an acetyl function [SH 2.09 s (3H); ~c 171.0 (s) and 21.3 (q)] and appeared to be a monoacetyl derivative of 4. The downfield shifts observed for H-3 and C-3 in its tH and t3C NMR spectra respectively indicated it to be 3-acetylleptophyllin A (5). This structure was fully corroborated by MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HMBC spectra. Some important HMBC correlations observed are depicted in Fig. 1. The physical data of the next most polar alkaloid, C17H35NO2, agreed well with those reported for iso- 6-canavaline (7). 11 The most polar alkaloid, C14H33NO3 (HRFABMS), [Ct]D -3.3 o, named leptophyllin B, had a singlet at ~C 182.8 in its 13C NMR spectrum, indicating the presence of a CO2H group. Evidence for the attachment of CO2H to the terminal carbon of the side chain was obtained by analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum, which had a triplet due to 2H at ~H 2.46 (Table 2). The MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectral data (Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were compatible with the structure 8 proposed for this alkaloid. The biological activity data for the alkaloids 1-3, 7, and 8 in our mechanism-based yeast mutant bioassays 2,3 are summarized in Table 4. Alkaloids 1 - 3 showed selective activities in RS 322YK and RS 321N assays compared with the wild-type RS 188N strain. Cytotoxic activities of 1 and 2 were evaluated in two cell lines (Table 4). (-)-Spectalinine (2) was found to be moderately active in both cytotoxicity assays. Compound Table 4.

EXPERIMENTAL General Experimental Procedures. These are identical to those reported in ref. 3; the IH and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 spectrometer at 400 and 100.57 MHz, respectively, with TMS as internal standard; DQCOSY, DEPT, HETCOR, COLOC, and HMBC NMR experiments were performed on the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences; IR spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer 727B spectrophotometer; for CC, m1203 (neutral) grade III was used; TLC and PTLC involved neutral A1203, Si gel and Whatman LKC18F plates; visualization on TLC was by spraying with Dragendorff and iodoplatinate reagents. 5934 V. DA S. BOLZANI et aL Plant MateriaL The plant material was collected in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in Jan. 1993, and identified by Dr. Claudia M. Young. A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Gardens of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Bioassays. Identical to those reported in ref. 3. Extraction and Isolation of Alkaloids. The semi-dried leaves of C. leptophylla Vog. (3.5 kg) were extracted with cold CHC13-MeOH (2:1), concentrated, redissolved in CHCI 3 and the CHC13 soluble fraction was extracted (x 3) with 2N aqueous HC1. The aqueous extracts were pooled, basified (pH = 9) with NH4OH, and successively extracted with CHC13 and EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4) and evaporated to yield the crude alkaloidal mixture (256 mg). This was subjected to CC on A1203; elution with mixtures of CH2CI2-MeOH of increasing polarity afforded 4 crude fractions containing alkaloids. Fraction 1 was further separated by CC on A1203 (solvent gradient, 1 - 10% EtOAc in CH2C12) followed by RP-TLC (20% H20 in MeOH) to furnish 1 (5.0 rag) and 2 (8.0 mg). Fraction 2 was submitted to Si gel PTLC (5% MeOH in CH2C12, triple elution) to afford 3 (2.8 mg). From fraction 3 were isolated 4 (1.8 rag), 5 (4.8 mg), and 7 (9.8 mg) by CC on A1203 (solvent gradient, 1 - 10% EtOAc in CH2C12). Purification of fraction 4 by RP-TLC (10% H20 in MeOH) afforded pure 8 (2.8 mg). (-),Spectaline (1).

The structure is in the apo form without cofactors in the subunits of the tetrameric gGAPDH in the asymmetric unit. Unequivocal density corresponding to the inhibitor was clearly identified in one monomer. The final refined model of the complex shows extensive conformational changes when com- pared with the native structure.

Introduction Some protozoan parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae cause a wide variety of severe diseases such as the American trypanosomiasis known as Chagas’ disease. Some 100 million persons ^ a quarter of all the inhabitants of Latin America ^ are at risk of contracting the disease and an estimated 16^18 million people are infected [1]. Chagas’ disease is caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is transmit- ted by the blood-sucking Triatomine insects, through blood transfusions or congenitally from infected mothers. No e¡ec- tive treatment is available for the disease [2]. The modern approach of target-directed drug development involves the identi¢cation of suitable enzymes taking part in essential metabolic pathways of pathogens. Several peculiar- ities in the biology of trypanosomatids have been suggested to be exploitable for drug design purposes [3]. Trypanosomatids are highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production [4,5] and the in silico modeling of the pathway has indicated the reaction catalyzed by glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) as one of the preferred steps for inhibition [6,7]. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative phosphor- ylation of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate into 1,3-diphospho- glycerate in the presence of NADþ and inorganic phosphate. Structural studies of the enzymes from Trypanosoma brucei [8] and Leishmania mexicana [9] have shown di¡erences in the NADþ cofactor binding pocket when compared with the hu- man homologue, which lead to the design and synthesis of several inhibitors focusing on this site [10^13]. Aiming at the design of novel classes of anti-chagasic drugs, the structure of the T. cruzi gGAPDH was determined and described else- where [14]. Computational search procedures [15] and exten- sive screening of plant extracts through the enzymatic inhib- itory assays have been performed in the search for promising lead compounds [15^17]. Several coumarins were found as the most promising class of substances from natural sources with signi¢cant gGAPDH inhibitory activity. Amongst them is chalepin (Fig. 1), a coumarin extracted from Pilocarpus spica- tus, which has an IC50 (inhibitor concentration required for 50% inhibition of enzymatic activity) of 64 WM [17]. In order to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition and the speci¢c mode of binding of this inhibitor, and to elicit further improvement of this molecule through structure-based drug design, we present here the crystallographic structure of gGAPDH from T. cruzi complexed with chalepin. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Preparation and puri¢cation of T. cruzi gGAPDH Recombinant T. cruzi gGAPDH was prepared and puri¢ed accord- ing to a previously reported procedure [14]. 2.2. Extraction, isolation and identi¢cation of chalepin The air-dried powdered stem of P. spicatus (Rutaceae) was exhaus- tively extracted with organic solvents (hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH) through percolation processing at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after evaporation of the solvents under reduced pres- sure at 40‡C. The hexane extract (PSSH, 6.0 g) was fractionated through liquid^liquid partition with hexane^methanol^water (10:9:1) followed by ethyl acetate^methanol^water (1:1:1) and buta- nol^methanol^water (1:1:2). The ethyl acetate fraction (PSSH/A, 1.3 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column using a step gradient of hexane and ethyl acetate. Successive £ash chromatography of the fraction eluted with 20^30% hexane/ethyl acetate allowed the isolation of the 6-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2,3-dihydro- 7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one, a coumarin known as chalepin (45 mg). The structure of chalepin was deduced on the basis of its spectral 0014-5793 / 02 / $22.00 L 2002 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

FEBS 26069 FEBS Letters 520 (2002) 13^17 data (1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry), which were con¢rmed by comparative analysis with the literature values [18]. 2.3. Enzymatic inhibition studies The enzymatic activities of T. cruzi gGAPDH and its human ho- mologue and the inhibitory activity of chalepin against these enzymes have been determined according to a previously reported procedure [17], using the forward reaction. The IC50 was determined empirically. A wide range of concentra- tions (10^100 Wg/ml) of inhibitor were tested at substrate and cofactor saturating conditions. The percentage of remaining activity was calcu- lated by comparison with an inhibitor-free control experiment. The chalepin showed no inhibition of human GAPDH activity while it showed an IC50 of 64 WM against T. cruzi gGAPDH, as mentioned above. 2.4. Co-crystallization assays Co-crystallization assays were carried out using a protein solution at 8 mg/ml in 0.1 M TEA pH 7.6, 1 mM NADþ, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 WM leupeptin and 1 WM pepstatin pre-incu- bated with 5 mM of inhibitor and 10% (v/v) of acetonitrile. Crystals of the complex gGAPDH^chalepin were grown at 22‡C by vapor di¡usion, against a reservoir solution of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.9^7.1, with 0.1 M calcium acetate, 16^18% of polyethylene gly- col 8000, in a microgravity environment during £ight STS-91 of the NASA US Space Shuttle program. Mechanical damage upon landing and transport of crystals resulted in few crystals being available for data collection. 2.5. Data collection and processing Crystals of the gGAPDH^chalepin complex were £ash-cooled to 100 K in an Oxford Cryostream Cooler. The cryoprotectant solution used consists of 20% polyethylene glycol 400 added to the above described reservoir solution. The X-ray source was a Rigaku RU- 200 rotating anode generator operating at 50 kV/100 mA. Di¡raction intensities were collected with an R-AXIS II image plate, using the rotation method [19]. Data processing was carried out with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [20]. Final electron density maps for each collected data set revealed that only in one crystal the inhibitor could be unambiguously modelled. Data collection and processing statistics for this data set are summarized in Table 1. The experiment had to be interrupted after 120 frames due to loss of cryogenic protection. All available and well measured data were included in the re¢nement, on the basis that the program used does take care adequately of low intensity data, through proper weighting of weak observations. The criterion used to decide on the cut-o¡ of the data was to limit the resolution when I/c(I) was above 1.0 and the Rmerge was below 50%. Crystals belong to the space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 82.08 A , b = 84.97 A , c = 105.24 A and L = 96.32‡. The analysis of crystal contents indicates one tetramer per asymmetric unit and a Vm value of 2.34 A 3/Da. 2.6. Structure determination and re¢nement The structure of the chalepin complex was determined by molecular replacement, using the program AMoRe [21]. The native gGAPDH structure without ligands or water molecules was used as the search model. Using di¡raction data in the resolution range 15.0^4.0 A , the top solution showed correlation coe⁄cient of 61.3% and Rfactor of 35.7%. The rotated and translated model was re¢ned using REFMAC [22], the electron density maps and omit maps were calculated using FFT [23] and OMIT [24], respectively, all from the CCP4 suite of programs [25]. Manual rebuilding of the macromolecular model and graphics visualization were performed using the O software [26]. The crystallographic Rfactor and Rfree;3% values, as well as the stereochem- istry quality of the model (program PROCHECK [27]), were con- stantly monitored during the course of the re¢nement. The ¢rst cycle was a rigid body re¢nement, with only the quater- nary structure of the model tetramer being allowed to change while the four individual subunits were held as rigid bodies. This re¢nement produced a Rfactor of 0.398 and Rfree of 0.405. 2Fobs3Fcalc and Fobs3Fcalc electron density maps calculated from this model showed no density in the cofactor binding sites which could be interpretable as NADþ. This fact clearly indicated the interference of the inhibitor over the enzyme. Thus, the following cycles of restrained crystallo- graphic re¢nement were carried out without non-crystallographic symmetry to search for any bound inhibitor to the tetramer. A di¡er- ence (Fobs3Fcalc) electron density map calculated after 10 cycles of automated restrained re¢nement showed density in the active site of the C subunit resembling the inhibitor. At this point, the Rfactor was 0.252 and Rfree was 0.322. After several iterative cycles of restrained re¢nement of the atomic coordinates followed by visual manipulation, water molecules were automatically built into the model using the program ARP [28]. After inclusion of 630 water molecules the Rfactor dropped to 0.209 and Rfree to 0.282. At this stage a molecule of chalepin was manually built into the electron density observed at the C subunit active site. The ¢nal cycles of re¢nement included the addition of another 307 waters, as well as the re¢nement of partial occupancies for the inhibitor and the two alternative conformations for the ^SH group of active site Cys166 of subunit C. The results are summarized in Table 2. 2.7. Protein data bank accession number The atomic coordinates of the T. cruzi gGAPDH^chalepin co-crys- tal structure and the structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under ID code 1K3T. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Quality of the structure The ¢nal 2Fobs3Fcalc electron density maps calculated for the gGAPDH^chalepin complex show good quality (Fig. 2). The stereochemistry of the structure is, in general, quite sat- isfactory, with more than 99% of the residues showing torsion angles in the favorable regions of the Ramachandran diagram [29]. Only Ala73 from the C subunit and Val255 from all sub- units are in unfavorable regions. Ala73 is located in a £exible loop at the N-terminal, which shows poor electron density, Fig. 1. Chalepin.

Val255 is located in a loop between two consecutive L-strands and its uncommon conformation is conserved in all other GAPDH structures available [8,9,14,30,31] and is important to maintain the correct positioning of the active residue Cys166 with respect to the nicotinamide ring of the NADþ cofactor during catalysis. The average temperature factor values for the main chain and all atoms of the 359 residues from each subunit are, respectively, 24.3 A 2 and 25.2 A 2, to the A subunit, 29.9 A 2 and 30.7 A 2, to the B subunit, 42.8 A 2 and 43.3 A 2, to the C subunit and 25.0 A 2 and 26.1 A 2, to the D subunit. The average temperature factor value for all atoms of chalepin is 70.8 A 2. The higher values of the average temperature factor observed for the C subunit re£ect the static disorder resulting from the partial occupancy of the inhibitor (85%) at its active site. Analysis of the crystal packing shows that the NADþ binding domain of subunit C has no lattice contacts, compat- ible with alternative domain rotations. 3.2. Structural di¡erences between gGAPDH complexed with chalepin (apo form, without NAD+) and the native holo form The four individual subunits of the gGAPDH tetramer are related to each other by a 222 non-crystallographic symmetry. Each subunit is composed of two domains: the NADþ bind- ing domain, comprising residues 1^150 at the N-terminal and residues 331^359 at the C-terminal; and the catalytic domain, Fig. 2. Electron density omit maps (2Fobs3Fcalc) of the GAPDH^chalepin complex, close to the active site, contoured at 1.3c level. Unambigu- ous density for the natural product inhibitor is seen.

The catalytic domain (left) was included in the superposition protocol. B: Close-up of the active site with ligands. The NADþ is bound to the native structure whereas the chalepin is bound in the complex structure. The clash observed in the region of the nicotinamide moiety of NADþ explains why the binding of the inhibitor implies in the displacement of the cofactor, therefore stabilizing the apo structure of the en- zyme. Figure produced with the program Web Lab Viewer (Molecular Simulations Inc.). F. Pava‹o et al./FEBS Letters 520 (2002) 13^17 15 comprising residues 151^330. The tetramer of GAPDH is formed exclusively through contacts between all four catalytic domains, constituting a rigid core of the tetrameric particle that remains virtually unchanged in both native and complex structures. The displacement of the NADþ cofactor by the binding of the inhibitor induces the holo to apo transition, represented predominantly by an approximate rigid-body ro- tation of 4‡ of the NAD binding domain of each subunit relative to the structurally conserved catalytic domain (Fig. 3). Other internal modi¢cations of the NADþ binding domain are also present. This feature has previously been observed in the apo and holo forms of GAPDH and liver alcohol de- hydrogenase enzymes from other sources [32^34]. The authors suggested that the overall e¡ect of this conformational change is to expose the cofactor and active site to solvent in the apo form and provide additional shield of the cofactor and active site from solvent in the holo form. Indeed, the tetrameric holo- enzyme shows a solvent-accessible surface area of 46 051 A 2 while the apo-enzyme has a surface area of 49 152 A 2. The solvent-accessible surface buried upon ligand binding at sub- unit C is 205 A 2. 3.3. gGAPDH^chalepin interaction architecture Of the possible 525 A 2 of solvent-accessible surface area in the free inhibitor, 209 A 2 are exposed to solvent in the com- plex and 316 A 2 are buried upon binding. The analysis of the complex shows three important interacting groups from cha- lepin (Fig. 4). The carbonyl oxygen from lactonic group in- teracts with residue Thr167 by hydrogen bonds mediated by a water molecule W739. The 1,1-dimethylallyl group interacts by hydrophobic contacts with catalytic residue Cys166, which has to undergo a conformational change through a rotation of M1, Fig. 4. Stereoview of the overall mode of binding of chalepin to gGAPDH active site. Figure produced with the program Web Lab Viewer [Molecular Simulations Inc.]. Fig. 5. View of the chalepin binding site. The neighboring regions of the 1,1-dimethylallyl group, which remain unoccupied after binding of the inhibitor, show charged residues which can be exploited in the design of new chalepin derivatives. Molecular surface of the gGAPDH generated with the program Web Lab Viewer [Molecular Simulations Inc.]. F. Pava‹o et al./FEBS Letters 520 (2002) 13^17 16 in order to accommodate the positioning of the inhibitor at the active site. Indeed, the ¢nal electron density maps show the two alternative conformations of Cys166, one of them ap- parently connecting to the inhibitor. This is an artifact, since the side chain of this residue is at the native conformation only when the inhibitor is absent. Therefore, the evident two conformations of the Cys166 side chain guarantee that the inhibitor has to have partial occupancy. Finally, the oxygen atom from the benzo-dihydrofuran group interacts with resi- due Arg249 through a hydrogen bond mediated by water mol- ecule W813. The 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group interacts weakly with the residue Asp210 by hydrogen bond mediated by a water molecule W812. 3.4. Implications for drug design approach Based on this analysis, modi¢cations in the chalepin inhib- itor can be suggested by molecular modeling studies. At the 1,1-dimethylallyl binding site it is evident (Fig. 5) that there are neighboring regions with charged residues, which remain unoccupied after binding of the inhibitor. It is therefore pos- sible to design the replacement of the 1,1-dimethylallyl group by substituents containing heteroatoms like nitrogen, oxygen or halogens. These modi¢cations could enable the formation of new dipole^dipole interactions resulting in energetic gain notably greater than the hydrophobic interactions observed in the crystal structure. Besides, Souza et al. [14] suggest that the substitution of Asp210 (T. cruzi) by Leu194 (human) brings a new target for selective inhibition. The chalepin 1-hydroxy-1- methylethyl group does not interact e⁄ciently with the pro- tein. The introduction of a linker arm of one or two carbon atoms may cause a closer contact between the chalepin hy- droxyl and the Asp210 delta2 oxygen atom, producing more e¡ective polar interactions and increasing speci¢city for the parasitic enzyme. New proposed coumarin derivatives are being synthesized and tested against T. cruzi gGAPDH to evaluate these possibilities.

Introduction Styracaceae is a family constituted of small trees and shrubs, mostly native to tropical and subtropical regions (Pio Correa, 1931). The genus Styrax is dierent from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat in¯ammatory dis- eases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styr- acaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985; Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988; Anil, 1980; Segal et al., 1967, 1964; Ulubelen et al., 1978; Kawai and Sugimota, 1940; Kitagawa et al., 1974; Ulubelen, 1976; Nakano et al., 1967). From the leaves of Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (4) and the known nor-lig- nans 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methyl- enedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1), 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7- methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2), 5- [300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (3) and the lignan di- hydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (5), together with urso- lic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds 1±2 showed inhibitory proper- ties against the microorganisms, Candida albicans, Clado- sporium cladosporioides and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elu- cidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and 2). 2. Results and discussion The dried and powdered leaves of Styrax ferrugineus were extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2ÐCH3OH (2:1 v/v).

The bioactive extract was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with n-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc (4300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by puri®cation on preparative HPLC aorded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (4) and the known nor-lignans (1) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (2) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and (3) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (5) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identi®ed by chromato- graphic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The tri- terpenes and sterols were identi®ed by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13C NMR spectral data for 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylene- dioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) and 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7-methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13C NMR spectral data for 1 and 2 are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC corre- lations are presented in Fig. 1. Compound 2 was obtained earlier from the seeds of S. ocinalis (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent puri®cation of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of S. camporum (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucida- tion of compound (4) as well as the antimicrobial activ- ities of all lignoids isolated. Compound 4 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The molecular formula C26H32O10 was deduced from ES-MS m/z [M+Na]+ 527, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. Its IR spectrum recorded hydroxyl (3550±3200 cmÿ 1), unsaturated (1650 cmÿ 1) and aromatic (1550, 870 cmÿ 1) absorptions, and its UV absorbance Table 1 1H NMR spectral data (400 MHz) of 2 and 4a Proton 4b,c COSY 3 7.17 s 4 7.11 d (1.9) H-6 6 6.77 d (1.9) H-4 20 7.41 d (1.9) H-60 50 7.05 d (8.0) H-60 60 7.44 dd (1.9; 8.0) H-20,60 100 2.75 t (7.5) H-200 200 1.86 dt (7.8) H-100,300 300 3.66 t (7.8) H-200,100 1000 4.11 d (8.0) H-300 2000 4.33 m H-1000,3000 3000 3.45 m H-2000,4000 4000 3.62 t (9.0) H-3000,5000 5000 3.64 ddd (9.0, 5.0, 3.0) H-4000,6000 6000 4.23 dd (12.0, 5.0) H-6a000,H-5000 4.20 dd (12.0, 3.0) OCH3-30 3.83 s OCH3-40 3.88 s OCH3-70 3.99 s a Chemical shifts are expressed in values.

The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Tables 1 and 2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 4 with those described for 2 indi- cated that 4 is a glucoside derivative of compound 2. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 displayed four doublets at 6.77 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at 7.44 (1H, dd, J=1.9; 8.0 Hz) attri- butable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at 7.17 (1H, s) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, s), two triplets due to methylene protons at 2.75 (2H, t, J=7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, t, J=7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at 1.86 (2H, dt, J=7.8 Hz). This 1H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of com- pound 2. Further analysis of the 1H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet at 4.11 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and several signals at 4.33±3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound 4. The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 2) suggested the presence of a nor-lignan with similar ske- leton to 2. The main dierence observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 4 was due to the presence of the signals at 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH2) which con®rmed a glucosyl moiety. The 1H±±1H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. 1H±13C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. 1H±13C-three-bond (HMBC) correla- tions from the H-100 protons resonances at 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at 107.64 and 112.12 identi®ed the later as C-4. The 3J HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-30 and C-40 quaternary carbons with H-20 and H-60 proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-tri- substituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound 4. Other signi®cant correlations for con®rmation of 4 are depicted in Fig. 1. The extract and compounds isolated from S. ferrugi- neus were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively. Compounds 1±2 exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus C. sphaer- ospermum could be predictive for the activity against C. albicans. In conclusion, the activities of compounds 1±5 may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infec- tions in several Brazilian regions. 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin±Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for 1H and 50 MHz for 13C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90 and 135, respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70±230 and 230±400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H2SO4 after heating. 3.2. Plant material Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart.

Bioassay The crude extract and puri®ed lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium S. aureus ATCC 12228, the fungus C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast C. albicans ICB 12. Stock solu- tions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure com- pounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appro- priate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on pre- coated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as posi- tive and negative controls, respectively. For the anti- fungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened cham- ber at 27C. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with C. albicans and S. aureus were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of C. albicans and S. aureus in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30C for 24 h. 3.4. Extraction Dried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of Styrax ferrugi- neus Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2±CH3OH (2:1, v/v) at room tempera- ture. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH±H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. After removal of the sol- vent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respec- tively. The CHCl3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel ¯ash (77.9 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gra- dient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5- (300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)benzofuran (1), and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(300 -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40 -dimethoxy- phenyl)benzofuran (2). Fr. 40±41 (39.4 mg) was fractio- nated by micron silica gel ¯ash CC (Merck) using CH2Cl2±CH3OH (95:5) as eluent to aord 11 Frs. Frs. 5±9 gave a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52±55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica ¯ash CC (11.6 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using Hex±EtoAc±CH3OH (6:2:2) as eluent to aord 20 Frs. Frs 6±12 furnished dihydrodehydiconiferyl alcohol (5) (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gradient yielded 22 Frs. Fr. 20 (13.8 mg) gave a mixture of 3+4, which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-18 column) using a mixture of CH3OH± H2O (4:6) as eluent to aord compounds 3 (4.0 mg) and 4 (5.8 mg). 3.4.1. 5-(300-Hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) White amorphous powder; IR max (KBr) 3432, 2926, 1606, 1476, 1232, 1148, 1037, 931 cmÿ 1; ES-MS [M+Na]+ m/z 349, ES-MS [M+K]+ m/z 365.

Hydrolysis of 4. A solution containing glucoside 4 (2.0 mg) in 3 M HCl (5 ml) was heated until re¯ux began, this being maintained for 4 h. The reaction mix- ture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 1% NaOH and extracted with CHCl3 (310 ml). The reaction mixture was puri®ed on CC silica gel using CH2Cl2±CH3OH (99:1) as eluent to obtain 2 (1.0 mg) which showed the same Rf [0.5 CH2Cl2±CH3OH (98:2)], IR and 1H of authentic 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-meth- oxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2).

Keywords: Piper hispidum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihy- dropyridone and piperidine moieties have been isolated from Piperaceae species (Parmar, 1997). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insec- ticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of Piper hispidum H.B.K. (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). In this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elu- cidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)-heptadienamide (1), 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one (2) and also of eight known antifungal amides N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3), piper- amine (4), N-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 -pyridin-2-one (5), piplartine (6), piperine (7), a,b- dihydropiperine (8), 5,6-dihydropiperlonguminine (9) and pellitorine (10). The amides isolated from stems of Piper hispidum (1, 3 and 4) and from seeds of Piper tubercu- latum (2, 5±10) were active against the fungus Clados- porium sphaerospermun as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). 2. Results and discussion A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of P. his- pidum was subjected to silica gel column chromato- graphy, followed by HPLC puri®cation to aord the compounds 1, 3 and 4. Compound 1, has a molecular formula C18H23NO3 as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of the 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cmÿ 1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.91 (2H, s), and four ole®nic protons which showed signals at 5.45 (1H, d, J3,4=12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, dd, J4,3 and 4,5=12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, dd, J5,4 and 5,6=12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, dt, J6,5 and 6,7=12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,-unsaturated carbonyl system.

The assignments of these ole®nic protons were con®rmed by analysis of the 1H±1H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylenic protons H-8 at 2.62 (2H, t, J8,7=7.0 Hz) and H-7 at 2.46 (2H, m) were con®rmed by the DQ- COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 ( 5.94, 1H) could be also observed. The presence of a isobutyl moiety was con®rmed by the signals at 3.13 (2H, dd, J100,200=7.0 Hz), 1.80 (1H, m) and 0.92 (6H, d, J300,200 and 400,200=7.0 Hz) attributed to H-100, H-200, H-300 and H-400, respectively. The coupling between H-100 and the NH hydrogen was con®rmed by 622 H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of 1 are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-®eld region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 166.5, ten ole®nic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; ArauÂ jo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of 1 was determined as (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8- (30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide. A CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of P. tuberculatum was fractionated by column chromato- graphy on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to aord compounds 2 and 5±10. Compound 2, was shown to have a molecular formula C17H19NO5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of 13C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cmÿ 1 (asymmetric C±O±C stretching). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 revealed the presence of meth- oxyphenyl groups by the signals at 3.84 (6H, s), 3.85 (3H, s), one aromatic proton signal at 6.76 (2H, s) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four ole®nic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at 6.48 assigned to H-8 (J8,9=12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at 6.71 assigned to H-9 (J9,8=12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the Z con®guration. The attribution of this con®guration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the Z isomer when compared with the E isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at 6.89 (J4,3 and 4,5=9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at 5.98 (J3,4 and 3,5=9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at 3.97 (J6,5=7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-®eld region of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four ole®nic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at 165.7 and 168.1.

H.M.D. Navickiene et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 623 of the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at 6.48 (H-8) and 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at 165.7 was assigned to C- 2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-®eld region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide 2 was de®ned as 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one. N- (12, 13, 14- Trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-3 - pyridin -2- one (5), a,b- dihydropiperine (8) and 5,6- dihydropiperlonguminine (9) have the molecular for- mula C17H21NO5, C17H21NO3 and C16H21NO3, respec- tively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), Piper guineense (Par- mar et al., 1997) and P. tuberculatum (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the ®rst time. N-[3-(60-methoxy-30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)- propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3) was previously isolated from Piper peepuloides (Shah et al., 1986) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piperamine (4) was previously obtained from Piper nigrum (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piplartine (6) was pre- viously described from Piper aborescens (Duh et al., 1990) and P. tuberculatum (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (7) was previously described from P. aborescens and P. tuberculatum (ArauÂ jo-JuÂ nior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (10) had been reported from Cissampelos glaberrina (Rosario et al., 1996). The antifungal activity of amides 1±10 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds 1±10 are shown in Table 3 and were per- formed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of C. sphaerospermum growth at that level were considered inactive. The minimum quantity of compounds 1±4, 6, 8±10 necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for 7 and 5 the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively. The values for 7 and 5 were comparable to those observed for the reference compounds miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). P. hispidum and P. tuberculatum have accumulated amides with cis geometry in their side chain, which is a structural feature quite rare in nature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1986). 3.

The voucher speci- mens are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de BiocieÃ ncias Ð USP, SaÄ o Paulo. 3.3. Antifungal assay The microorganism used in the antifungal assay C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de BotaÃ nica, SaÄ o PauloÐSP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay Ð 10 ml of solutions corresponding to 100 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermun in glucose and salt solution (Rahali- son et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25C. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the mini- mal amount of 1±10 required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 mg) and miconazole (0.5 mg) were used as positive controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents The dried and powdered stems of P. hispidum (28.0 g) were extracted with CH2Cl2 (3150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 1 (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 3 (0.004 g). Frs containing 4 were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of P. tuberculatum (24.3 g) were extracted CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) (2 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromato- graphic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:- EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 2 (0.024 g) and 6 (0.003 g). Fraction 20 (0.146 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 5 (0.005 g). Fraction 19 (0.083 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions] to yield 7 (0.012 g) and 8 (0.007 g). Frs. 8 and 13 yielded 10 (0.079 g) and 9 (0.018 g), respectively. 3.5.

Introduction As part of our continuous investigation into the chemi- cal composition of Brazilian Neoraputia (Engler) Emmer- ich species, we recently reported the isolation of eight polymethoxylated ¯avones and one ¯avanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich (Arruda et al., 1991, 1993), four polymethoxylated ¯avones, 20-hydroxy-3,4,40,5,60-pen- tamethoxychalcone (1) and 20-hydroxy-3,4,40,5-tetra- methoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (2) from N. magni®ca var. magni®ca (Engler) Emmerich (Passa- dor et al., 1997). The isolation of these interesting new chalcones combined with our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae stimulated an investigation of other organs of N. magni®ca var. magni®ca. Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan Trypano- soma cruzi, is estimated to aect some 16±18 million people,mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organization). Control of the insect vector (Triotoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimina- tion of transmission by insect bites, and, as a con- sequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the dis- ease. Besides low ecacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side eects (Souza et al., 1998). The bloodstream form of the parasite T. cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production (Souza et al., 1998). This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined (Souza et al., 1998). GAPDH catalyses the 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results and discussion The hexane extract of the ripe fruits of N. magni®ca var. magni®ca, aorded g-tocopherol and three chal- cones. One was characterised as 20-hydroxy-3,4,40,5-tet- ramethoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (2) by comparison with both published data and an authentic sample (Passador et al., 1997). Placement of the chro- mene ring between C-50 and O-60 in 2 was determined on the basis of the following data. The 1H NMR spec- trum (Table 1) showed features of a chromene ring ( 6.60 and 5.47 vinylic protons, and a singlet at 1.50, 6H, assigned to a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups) and signals for four methoxy groups. The assignment of one singlet to H-2 and H-6 ( 6.86, 2H) suggested that three methoxy groups are attached to the B-ring. From a biosynthetic point of view, the remain- ing methoxy group could be attached to C-40 or C-60 of the A-ring. The spectrum also revealed a singlet at 14.24 corresponding to one chelated hydroxyl, thus attached to C-20. Furthermore, a singlet at 6.07 (1H) clearly indicated the A-ring to be 20,40,50,60- or 20,30,40,60- tetrasubstituted. From the HMBC experiments (Table 2) the observed correlations between the hydroxyl pro- ton at 14.24 and the 13C signals at 105.9 (J3), 167.9 Table 1 1H NMR chemical shifts for chalcones 1±4 H 1 2 3 4 30 6.2 d (2.4) 6.07 s 6.06 s 6.07 s 50 5.97 d (2.4) 2 6.84 s 6.86 s 7.56 d (8.6) 7.16 d (2.0) 3 6.93 d (8.6) 5 6.93 d (8.6) 6.90 d (8.3) 6 6.84 s 6.86 s 7.56 d (8.6) 7.20 dd (2.0, 8.3) b 7.71 d (16) 7.72 d (16) 7.77 d (15.5) 7.76 d (15.5) a 7.80 d (16) 8.05 d (16) 8.02 d (15.5) 8.03 d (15.5) 100 6.60 d (12) 6.58 d (9.8) 6.60 d (9.9) 200 5.47 d (12) 5.45 d (9.8) 5.47 d (9.9) 400/500 1.50 s 1.55 s 1.56 s OMe 3.84 s 3.87 s 3.86 s 3.86 s OMe 3.90 s 3.90 s 3.86 s 3.93 s OMe 3.91 s 3.90 s 3.94 s OMe 3.92 s 3.91 s OMe 3.92 s OH 14.31 s 14.24 s 14.31 s 14.34 s 644 D.M. Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 (J2) and 92.5 (J3) led to their assignments as C-10, C-20 and C-30, respectively, thus indicating that the unsub- stituted carbon must be vicinal to C-20. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 3) showed a signal for only one meth- oxy group attached to the ortho-disubstituted carbon ( 63.1) which was assigned to the 4-OMe functionality. This implies that the methoxy group in the A-ring is located at C-40 ( 55.9), and therefore established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-50 and O- 60. Moreover, the existence of any correlation between the 1H signal at 6.07, assigned to H-30 (by HSQC and HMBC), and the 13C signal at 102.9 (C-50), con®rmed the position of the chromene ring between C-50 and O- 60. The mass spectrum and elemental analysis data for 2 are reported here for the ®rst time (see also Scheme 1 and Section 3). Chalcone (3) exhibited similar NMR spectra to that of 2 (Tables 1 and 3). In addition to signals described for the A-ring of 2, the 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a 1,4-disubstituted phenyl moiety ( 7.56 d, J=8.6 Hz, H-2 and H-6; 6.93 d, J=8.6 Hz, H-3 and H-5). The presence of a fragment ion at m/z 161 (Scheme 1) in the mass spectrum for 3, associated with cleavage between the A-ring and C-b0, clearly indicated the pre- sence of one methoxy group in the B-ring. The signal of H-2/H-6 ( 7.56) showed a one-bond correlation (by HSQC) with the 13C signal at 130.0, and a long-range correlation (by HMBC, Table 2) with the 13C signal at Table 3 13C NMR chemical shifts for chalcones 1±4 and ¯avones 5±8a C 1 2 3 4 C 5 6 7 8 1 131.2 130.8 128.4 128.0 2 160.5 160.7 160.8 160.2 2 105.7 105.3 130.0 109.4 3 108.9 107.8 107.5 108.7 3 153.5 153.4 114.5 153.4 4 177.5 177.1 177.1 176.6 4 141.0 139.5 161.1 149.0 5 161.0 152.6 152.6 161.3 5 153.5 153.4 114.5 111.1 6 96.2 140.4 140.4 96.8 6 105.7 105.3 130.0 123.3 7 164.1 157.7 157.7 164.4 10 105.8 105.9 106.4 106.3 8 92.9 96.2 96.2 93.7 20 168.5 167.9 167.5 167.4 9 159.9 154.4 154.4 160.1 30 93.9 92.5 92.7 92.7 10 109.3 112.9 112.9 109.7 40 166.3 161.3 161.4 161.2 10 126.8 126.0 125.6 126.0 50 91.5 102.9 103.1 102.9 20 103.5 100.4 106.1 106.6 60 162.5 156.0 155.7 155.6 30 153.6 149.5 148.4 148.9 b 142.4 142.3 142.3 142.6 40 140.9 138.1 150.3 150.6 a 127.0 126.5 125.2 125.2 50 153.6 143.8 108.7 108.9 b0 192.4 192.4 192.8 192.4 60 103.5 106.6 121.0 121.3 100 116.9 116.8 116.8 OMe 55.8 56.3 56.3 55.9 200 124.2 124.5 124.4 OMe 56.4 56.9 61.6 56.2 300 77.7 77.9 77.8 OMe 56.4 61.5 62.2 400/500 28.1 28.0 27.9 OMe 56.4 62.2 OMe 55.6 55.9 55.4 55.8 OMe 61.0 OMe 55.8 55.9 55.8 56.1 OCH2O 102.2 101.9 102.5 OMe 55.8 55.9 56.1 OMe 56.2 63.1 OMe 61.0 a Assignments based on HSQC/HMBC for 1±4 and 6. 13C±1H COSY and long range 13C±1H COSY for 5 and HSQC for 8.

Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 645 161.1 (J3), thus indicating the methoxy group to be located at C-4 and permitting the assignment of the signal at 161.1 to C-4. HSQC experiments also showed correlations of the signal of H-3/H-5 ( 6.93) with the 13C signal at 114.5. In addition, the signal of H-a ( 8.02) showed cross peaks with the 13C signal at 128.4, indicating this signal to C-1. For 2, placement of the chromene ring was apparent from the J3 couplings observed between the hydroxyl proton (20-OH) and the 13C signal for C-30, indicating that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-20. HMBC experiments with 3 did not detect any correla- tions of the hydroxyl signal with the A-ring carbons. However, the 13C NMR spectrum of 3 (Table 3) revealed resonances for C-10 to C-60 and C-100 to C-500 in close agreement with the resonances for the corre- sponding carbons in 2. A singlet at 6.06 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the 13C signal at 92.7, permitting the assignment of these signals to H-30 and C-30, respectively, when compared with 2. The 13C NMR spectrum of 3 did not show any signal for meth- oxy groups attached to the ortho-disubstituted carbon (ca 63); they were observed at 55.4 and 55.8. This implies that the methoxy in the A-ring was located at C- 40 and established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-50 and O-60. The signals at 55.4 and 55.8 were then assigned to 40-OMe and/or 4-OMe. Based on the above evidence, the correlations from H-30 to the 13C signals of C-50 ( 103.1) and C-10 ( 106.4) were consistent with the angular structure for 3. The new natural product is, therefore, 20-hydroxy-4,40-dime- thoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chalcone (3). Chalcone (4) also showed spectral characteristics of a 20-hydroxy-40-methoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano)chal- cone (Tables 1 and 3). HMBC experiments (Table 2) with 4 also did not detect a relationship between the 20- OH signal at 14.34 to the A-ring carbons. However, the chemical shifts of the A-ring and chromene carbons were comparable with those for 2 and 3 (Table 3). As discussed above, the signals of the methoxy groups at 55.8 and 56.1 (6H) supported the chromene ring to be between C-50 and O-60. This was also con®rmed by the HMBC experiments, which showed correlations of the H-30 signal ( 6.07) with the resonances of C-20 ( 167.4) and C-10 ( 106.3). The mass spectrum of 4 gave signi®cant fragments for m/z 191 and 233 (Scheme 1) requiring the presence of two methoxy groups in the B-ring. This was supported by the 1H NMR spectrum which showed signals for three methoxy groups ( 3.94, 3H, s; 3.93, 3H, s; 3.86, 3H, s) and for three protons giving rise to an AB spin system ( 7.16, d, J=2.0 Hz, H-2; 6.90, d, J=8.3 Hz, H-5; 7.20, dd, J=2.0 and 8.3 Hz, H-6). From the HMBC experiments (Table 2), the observed correlation Scheme 1.

Tomazela et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 643±651 between the b-proton at 7.76 and the 13C signals at 109.4 (J3) and 123.3 (J3) led to their assignments as C-2 and C-6, respectively. The spectrum also showed a cor- relation of H-6 at 7.20 with the 13C signal at 149.0 (J3), con®rming a methoxy group at C-4 and showing that this signal can be attributed to C-4. The existence of a correlation between the 1H signal at 7.16, assigned to H-2, and the 13C signal at 153.4 determined the position of the other methoxy group at C-3 and per- mitted the assignment of this signal to C-3. The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 20- hydroxy-3,4,40-trimethoxy-50,60-(200,200-dimethylpyrano) chalcone (4). It has been noted that the H-b and C-b of a chalcone are more deshielded than the H-a and C-a resonances (Agrawal, 1989). Both are aected by changes in the B- ring substitution and C-a also by the presence or absence of a 20- or 60-oxysubstituent. HSQC experiments of 1±4 showed correlations of 1H signals at ca 8.0 and 7.7 to the 13C signals at ca 126 and 142, respectively, indi- cating apparent anomalies. The methine proton at ca 7.7 showed cross peaks with the C-2 and C-6 signals (Table 2), so permitting the assignment of the up®eld signal at ca 7.7 to H-b. The anisotropic eect of the 50,O-60-chromene substituent on the H-a caused a down®eld shift above the usual range for 20,60-oxysub- stituted chalcones, this resulting in the H-a proton being more deshielded than H-b. The dichloromethane extract of fruits on successive chromatographic separation aorded the ®ve ¯avonoids, 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avanone (Passador et al., 1997), 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avone (5) (Passador et al., 1997), 30,40-methylenedioxy-50,5,6,7-tetramethoxy¯avone (6) (Arruda et al., 1993), 30,40-methylenedioxy-5,6,7-tri- methoxy¯avone (7), and 30,40-methylenedioxy-5,7-di- methoxy¯avone (8). The latter appears to be new. Compound 6 has been isolated from Ageratum cony- zoides (Vyas and Mulchandani, 1986) and N. alba (Arruda et al., 1993); however, its 13C NMR data are reported here for the ®rst time (Table 4). The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 6, permitted the assign- ments of all carbons (Tables 2 and 3). A singlet at 6.55 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C signal at 107.8, and a long-range correlation with the 13C signals at 126.0 (J3), 160.7 (J2), 177.1 (J2) and 112.9 (J3) permitting their assignments as H-3, C-3, C-10, C-2, C-4 and C-10, respectively. Two doublets at 7.06 and 7.07 were coupled to each other and showed a long- range correlation with the C-2 and C-10 signals, thus indicating these two hydrogens were attached to C-20 and C-60. The 1H NMR spectrum revealed a signal for three methoxy groups at 3.98 (6H) and 3.99 (3H); however, in HSQC ( 62.2, 56.9, 56.3) and HMBC experiments these signals appeared as a broad singlet. The observed correlations between the methoxy protons at 3.98/or 3.99 and the 13C signal at 143.8 (J3), which showed cross peaks with the 1H signal at 7.07, led to their assignments as 50-OMe, C-50 and H-60. The signal at 7.06 was then assigned to H-20. HSQC experiments permitted the assignments of 13C signal at 100.4, 106.6 and 56.3/or 56.9 to C-20, C-60 and 50-OMe, respectively. HMBC experiments also con®rmed the B-ring to have a methylenedioxy group between C-30 and C-40 by the cross peaks with the 1H signal of OCH2O at 6.08 with the 13C signals at 149.5 and 138.1, which showed cor- relations with H-20 and the latter ( 138.1) with H-60. The signals at 149.5 and 138.1 were then assigned to C-30 and C-40, respectively. The 13C signal at 102.2 could be attributed to OCH2O by HSQC. The 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for two meth- oxy groups at 61.5 and 62.2. Thus implies that the methoxy groups in the A-ring are located at C-5, C-6 and C-7, since the 1H signal at 6.78 (1H) for the unsub- stituted methine indicated that this proton must not be vicinal to CO (C-4). Thus, the observed one-bond correlation between the signal of H-8 ( 6.78) and the 13C signal at 96.2 led to the assignment of C-8 to this resonance. The methoxy protons at 3.92 showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C signal at 61.5, and a long-range correlation with the 13C signal at 140.4 (J3), suggesting the assignment of the latter signal to C-6 or C-5. The presence of a correlation between the signal of H-8 and the 13C signal at 140.4 (J3) clearly indicated this signal to be at C-6. The signal for C-7 was estab- lished as 157.7 by the existence of a correlation Table 4 Eect of compound 5, mixture of 6+7 and 2+4 on TcGAPDH acti- vitya Compound Concentration (mg/ml) Absorbance Speci®c activity (U/mg) % Inhibitory activity 5 30 0.345 24.65 46 50 0.136 9.72 80 100 0.009 0.64 99 Control 30 0.641 45.80 50 0.670 47.87 100 0.560 40.01 6+7 25 0.343 20.24 54 35 0.249 14.69 68 100 0.000 00.00 100 Control 25 0.751 44.31 35 0.773 45.61 100 0.688 40.59 2+4 105 0.425 25.08 45 Control 105 0.773 45.61 a Control: 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.6 buer, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b- mercapto-ethanol, 30 mM Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mM NAD+, 0.3 mM gly- ceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 4±9 mg protein and 10% DMSO, in a total volume of 1000 ml.

In the same way, the signal for C-5 emerged from analysis of the correlation between the methoxy signal at 3.98/or 3.99 ( 62.2 by HSQC) and the 13C signal at 152.6, which did not show a correla- tion with the H-8 signal. The H-8 signal also showed a cross-peak with the 13C signal at 154.4 (J2), which was attributed to C-9, since it was the only carbon to be assigned in the A-ring. Flavone 8 exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 1H NMR spectrum for 30,40-substitution ( 7.54, dd, J=1.8 and 0.4 Hz, H-20; 6.98, dd, J=8.1 and 0.4 Hz, H-50; 7.51, dd, J=8.1 and 1.8, H-60). This spectrum also showed signals for a meta-coupled A-ring protons ( 6.55, d, J=2.3 Hz, H-6; 6.78, d, J=2.3 Hz, H-8), two methoxy groups ( 3.85, s, 6H) and one methylenedioxy group ( 6.07, s, 2H). The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) (Chen et al., 1997) fragments of this ¯avone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B-rings (Scheme 2). Thus, a combination of 1H NMR spectral data and the fragment ions at m/z 146 (70%) and 180 (5%) fully sup- port the presence of a 30,40-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and a 5,7-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. HSQC experiments permitted assignments of all proto- nated carbons (Table 3). However, the 13C signals at 96.8 and 93.7 were attributed to C-6 and C-8, and the 1H signals at 6.55 and 6.78 to H-6 and H-8, respectively, by com- parison with the resonances for the corresponding carbons and hydrogens in 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avone (5). The quaternary carbons of the A- and C-rings ( 160.2, C-2; 176.6, C-4; 161.3, C-5; 164.4, C-7; 160.1, C-9; 109.7, C-10) were also assigned by comparison with those of 5 ( 160.5, C-2; 177.5, C-4; 161.0, C-5; 164.1, C-7; 159.9, C- 9; 109.3, C-10), whose assignments were aided by 13C±1H COSY and long-range 13C±1H COSY spectra (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997). The signal for C-30 was established as 148.9 by its comparison with the reso- nance for the corresponding carbon in 6. The signal at 150.6 was then assigned to C-40. The structure of ¯avone 8 was thus established as 30,40-methylenedioxy-5,7- dimethoxy¯avone. Flavone 5 was previously obtained from N. alba (Arruda et al., 1993) and Murraya panicu- lata (Rutaceae) (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997). 30,40-Methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxy¯avone (7, age- cony¯avone A) has been found previously in Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae) (Vyas et al., 1986). However, its 13C NMR spectral data have not been reported previously in the literature. The chemical shifts of the A- and B-ring carbons were comparable with those for 6 and 8, respectively (Table 3). All phytochemical studies on Neoraputia genus have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation proce- dures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been pre- sent. However, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove Neoraputia to the Citroideae, which produces a con- siderable number of highly oxygenated ¯avones (Passa- dor et al., 1997; Silva, et al., 1988). Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of Neoraputia species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. Some compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from T. cruzi (Table 4). Chalcone 2 was sepa- rated from 4 and ¯avone 6 from 7 by R-HPLC; how- ever, they were obtained in very small amount. Thus, only the initial inhibitory activity of these mixtures were evaluated. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 45% when the mixture of 2 and 4 was added to the assay system at a concentration of 105 mg/ml, suggesting that these chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The mixture of 6 and 7 completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 100%) at 100 mg/ml. The activity of ¯avone 5 was comparable to that of the mixture of 6±7, reducing the enzymatic activity by 99% at 100 mg/ml. The 50% inhibitory concentration value (IC50) was 81 mM. Highly oxygenated ¯avones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal Scheme 2. Mass spectral fragmentation of 8. 648 D.M.

However, to develop an eective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make speci®c interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. For this purpose co-crystal- lization experiments with ¯avone 5 have been undertaken, both in laboratory and under microgravity conditions, in the NASA Space Shuttle during mission STS-91, in May 1998. Unfortunately, we did not have any success with ¯avone 5, and eective crystallization was observed only for a rutaceous coumarin. The related crystallographic studies are in progress and will be reported separately. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evi- dence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the speci®city in the catalytic-site- activity relationships among ¯avones and the enzyme GAPDH. Further crystallization experiments as well as solution studies by NMR spectral analysis are in progress. 3. Experimental 3.1.

Plant material Neoraputia magni®ca var. magni®ca was collected in Espirito Santo, Brazil, and a voucher specimen (SPF 81- 316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de CieÃ ncias BioloÂ gicas-USP-SaÄ o Paulo. 3.3. Isolation of compounds Ground fruits (825 g) were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ®nally with MeOH. The conc. hexane extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using a hexane±CH2Cl2±MeOH gradient to give a mixture of fatty acids followed by 16 fractions. Fr 5 was rechromatographed on silica gel using hexane±CH2Cl2 gradient aording further frs. Fr 5-3 was rechromato- graphed as above, eluting with hexane±CH2Cl2±MeOH (15:5:1) yielding 1 (12 mg). The fraction containing 2 and 4 was then subjected to further ¯ash chromato- graphy as above, eluting with a hexane±Me2CO gra- dient, and then by R-HPLC (detection UV l 254 nm) to give 2 (2nd peak, 1.9 mg) and 4 (1st peak, 2.0 mg), after recycling 3. Fr containing 3 was applied to ¯ash chro- matography as above, eluting with a hexane±CH2Cl2 gra- dient, and then by prep. TLC (silica gel, hexane±CH2Cl2± MeOH (1:1:0.1) to yield pure 3 (6.1 mg). The concd CH2Cl2 extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a hexane±CH2Cl2±MeOH (1:1:0.2) aorded 16 frs. Fr 3 was subjected to ¯ash chromato- graphy on silica gel column, eluting with hexane± CH2Cl2±MeOH (1:1:0.1) to aord 4 new frs. Fr 3-2 was treated as above, eluting with a hexane±EtOAc gradient, to aord 30,40,50,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avanone (5.0 mg), after crystallization from MeOH. Fr 4 was recrystallized from MeOH and then puri®ed by prep. TLC (silica gel, benzene±CH2Cl2±Me2CO, 7:5:2) to give a mixt. of 6 and 7. This mixt. was submitted to R-HPLC (detection UV l 254 nm) to aord 6 (2nd peak, 2.0 mg) and 7 (1st peak, 2.5 mg), after recycling 3. Fr 6 was crystallized from MeOH yielding 5 (30 mg). Fr 11 aorded 8 (15 mg) after crystallization from MeOH. 3.3.1. 20-Hydroxy-3,4,40,5-tetramethoxy-50,60-(200,200-di- methylpyrano)chalcone (2) Yellow powder; EA: Found: C, 67.62; H, 6.04; O, 26.34.

Preparation and puri®cation of recombinant T. cruzi GAPDH Tc GAPDH was overexpressed and puri®ed as reported by Souza et al. (1998). 3.5. T. cruzi GAPDH-activity Tc GAPDH activity was determined according to a modi®cation of a previously reported procedure (Barbosa and Nakano, 1987). Reduced NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 30 s intervals. The reaction medium was 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.6 buer, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b-mercapto-ethanol, 30 mM Na2 HAsO4, 2.5 mM NAD+, 0.3 mM glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate and 4±9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The speci®c activity (unit=U) of the enzyme was cal- culated as below: U=mg absorbance=t volume of cell =6:22 volume of enzyme enzyme where t=0.5 min; volume of cell=1.00 ml; eNADH= 6.22 (mMol/cm3)ÿ1 cmÿ1; volume of enzyme=0.005 ml; [ ] concentration of enzyme in mg/ml. 3.6. T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity The inhibitory activity was recorded using the reac- tion medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 ml. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30 s intervals. Com- pound 5 was tested at 30, 50 and 100 mg/ml in 10% DMSO using 5 ml of GAPDH-9 (prepared in January 1998) at 0.90 mg/ml. The mixture of 6 and 7 was tested at 25, 35 and 100 mg/ml in 10% DMSO using 5 ml of GAPDH-10 (prepared in February 1998) at 1.09 mg/ml. The mixture of 2 and 4 was tested at 105 mg/ml as for the mixture above. In each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO alone in the reaction medium and was used as a positive control. The speci®c activity of TcGAPDH was not signi®cantly aected by 10% DMSO alone. Data were means of three repetitions and values as a percent of control were used as follows: % inhibitory activity U=mg compound ÿ U=mg control=U=mg control 100: Acknowledgements The authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvol- vimento CientõÂ®co e TecnoloÂ gico (CNPq), FundacË aÄ o de Amparo aÁ Pesquisa do Estado de SaÄ o Paulo (FAPESP), CoordenacË aÄ o de AperfeicË oamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES), Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) and the World Health Organization (TDR grant 940854) for ®nancial support.

Introduction In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) we reported the isolation and characterization of two C- glycosylated anthrones (picramniosides D, E), and two C-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B), as well as emodin and umbelliferone, from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis Tul., a tree found in Central America. Further investigations aorded, in minor quantities, two new C,O-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picramnioside F (1), and an oxathrone, mayoside C (2), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (3) and 8-O-b-d-gluco- pyranosyl emodin (4). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of com- pounds 1 and 2, and the antifungal activity of the iso- lated compounds. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract from the bark of P. teapensis aorded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds 1± 4, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shi- madzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones 3 and 4 were identi®ed on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992). Compound 1 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 671 ([M+1]+), 693 ([M+Na]+) and 709 ([M+K]+), with the base peak at m/z 509 ([M+1- C6H10O5]+). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

E-mail address: djbf@power.ufscar.br (J.B. Fernandes). All of the spectroscopic characteristics of 1 were coincident with those of anthrones which we have pre- viously reported (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at lmax 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cmÿ1), ester carbonyl (1735 cmÿ1) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cmÿ1) groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at 7.4±7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of meta-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at 3.40±3.95, indicating sugar moieties. The presence of 33 carbons was evident from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at 95.8 and 105.4. Signals in the region of 62±81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D±E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agree- ment with lyxose (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on SolõÂs et al. (1995) which identi®ed the sugar of picramniosides A±C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-O were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments con®rmed only one CH2 signal at 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit. Complete assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experi- ments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In parti- cular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) 3J coupling between the ester carbonyl ( 164.7) and H-10, H-200 and H-600, indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-10 of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) 3J coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-50 ( 81.4), con- ®rming the position of the aglycone at C-50 of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a 3J correlation of the anomeric 838 T. RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 837±841 proton of the glucose unit (H-1, 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the O-glucose unit at C-8. The magnitude of the coupling constant between H-50 and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an eq±eq conformation for these protons. The con®guration of the lyxose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (SolõÂs et al., 1995; HernaÂ ndez- Medel et al., 1998; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-10 and H-20 (J=0 Hz) suggesting an eq±eq conformation for these protons. Likewise, the J value of H-5000 (12 Hz) indicated an ax±ax conformation for H-5000 and H-4000 in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety. Further observations helped to establish the con®gura- tion at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of 1 (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picramnioside E (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the fol- lowing expected dierences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to O-glucosylation at C-8. Compound 2 was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of 2 gave pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 709 ([M+Na]+) and 725 ([M+K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]ÿ), which was consistent with the molecular for- mula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS±MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (m/z 563), lyxose (m/z 432), CH2OH (m/z 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corre- sponding to emodin (269). As observed previously for the mayosides (HernaÂ n- dez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed the same pattern described for 1, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of 2 had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). O-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound 2 at ring A. Assignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with pub- lished data (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not aord all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1000 with C-1 ( 162) helped to con®rm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1000. Circular dichroism con®rmed the absolute con®guration at C-10 of 1 and 2 as S and R, respectively.

The compounds mayoside B, picramnioside E, 3, 4, emodin and umbelliferone were tested in the growth inhibition assay of Leucoagaricus gongilophorus, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. (1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds 3 and 4 presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in Sesamum indicum. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material. 3.

Plant material The bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San JoseÂ de la MontanÄ a, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica. 3.3. Isolation of constituents Dried and powdered bark of P. teapensis (615 g) was macerated with EtOH±H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was ®ltered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then n-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml minÿ1 UV detector at 254 nm), to aord compound 1 (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-O-b- (3) and 8-O-b-glucopy- ranosyl emodin (4). Further puri®cation of 3 (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and 4 (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described). Fraction 11 was submitted to HPLC separation under the same conditions (6.5 ml minÿ1, 7 cycles) to aord pure com- pound 2 (1.2 mg, 0.0004% w/w). 3.4.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of Piper arboreum yielded two new amides, N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) together with the known compounds N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E), 9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4). Catalytic hydrogenation of 3 yielded the amide N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5). We also have isolated six amides (6–11) and two antifungal cinnamoyl derivatives (12, 13) from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum. Compounds 1–11 showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against Cladosporium sphaerospermum while compounds 3-4 and 6–13 also showed antifungal activity against C. cladosporioides. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Keywords: Piper arboreum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Chemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, lig- noids and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996; Parmar et al, 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadie- noyl]pyrrolidine, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl- 8-(30,40-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Ale´ cio et al., 1998) and 8(Z)-N- (12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one from Piper tuberculatum Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)- pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) and nine (3–11) known antifungal amides N-[10- (13,14-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3), its deri- vative N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)- 7(E),9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4); besides pellitorine (6), abdihydropiperine (7), piplartine (8), dihydro- piplartine (9), cis-piplartine (or 8(Z)-N-(12,13, 14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one) (10) and fagaramide (11). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxy- dihydrocinnamate (12) and methyl trans-6,7,8-trimethox- ycinnamate (13). The amides isolated from leaves of Piper arboreum (1–4) and the hydrogenated derivative of 3 (5) were active against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum 3, 4 and 6–13 0031-9422/02/$ - see front matter # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results and discussion N-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pen- tadienoil]-pyrrolidine (1) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electro- spray mass spectrum (ES–MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.93 (2H, s), and four oleﬁnic protons which showed signals at 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7=14.3 and J8,9=10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8=10.9 and J9,10=11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9= 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the E and Z geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the E and Z conﬁgurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of trans-trans conﬁguration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assign- ment of the cis conﬁguration for the g, double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at 3.52 (2H, m) and 1.90 (2H, m) attrib- uted to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of 1 were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-ﬁeld region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 164.8, 10 sp2 car- bons, four sp3 carbons [C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Arau´ jo-Junior et al., 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). Arboreumine (2) was shown to have the molecular formula C25H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES–MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respec- tively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at 2.15 (2H, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H- 20a and H-2b, H-20b which are characteristic of methyl- ene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-90, at 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at 1.20 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-110; H-13, H-120; H-14, H-130 and H-11, H-100, respectively. The signal at 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as conﬁrmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-50; H-8, H-70 and H-9, H-80 showed signals at 5.81 (q, J6,1250,110= 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (dd, J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1,0 Hz) and 5.76 (dd, J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further conﬁrmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-70; H-9, H- 80 and H-10, H-90 was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at 5.76 assigned to H- 9, H-80 (J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-70 (J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-90 (J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 assigned to H-11, H- 100 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-20a (J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at 2.37 assigned to H- 2b, H-20b (J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spec- tral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum.

At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-20a and H-2b, H-20b ( 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 ( 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-120 and C-14, C-130 and H-14, H-130 and C-13, C-120 were also observed. The carbon signals at 163.9 (C-5, C-40), 126.1 (C-6, C-50) and 40.9 (C-3, C-30) showed a correla- tion with the 1H singlet at 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at 2.15 (H-2a, H-20a), corroborating the adjacent rela- tionship between the amide group and C-2, C-20. The carbon signals at 67.3 (C-10, C-90) and 135.6 (C-9, C- 80) showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-100 adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,- unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambigu- ously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 110 with the carbon signals 126.1 (C-6, C- 50) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70), whereas the quadruplet at 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-50 (J6,1250,110=1,0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70). Finally, HET- COR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide 2 was determined as depicted. The CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of P. tuberculatum were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C6H14 con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to aﬀord compounds 6–13. Pellitorine (6) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further puriﬁcation, and it was identiﬁed by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data pre- viously described by Rosario et al., 1996. a,bdihydro piperine (7) and dihydropiplartine (9) had their 1H NMR spectra published for the same compounds pre- viously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and Piper guineense (Parmar et al., 1997) and their 13C NMR spectral data recently pub- lished (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (8) was iso- lated from seeds and leaves, and the 1H and 13C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). Cis-piplartine (10) had its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (11) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl trans-6,7,8-tri- methoxycinnamate (13) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectro- scopic data were similar to that obtained in this work. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–13 was deter- mined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of com- pounds 1–13 (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered. The minimum amount of compounds 3–4; 2 and 5; and 1 required to inhibit growth of the fungus C. sphaero- spermum on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the stan- dards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against C. cladosporioides, the amide 4 being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds 6–10, 13 and 11, 12 the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus C. clados- porioides on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for 6–10 and 13 indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from P. arboreum are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the Table 2 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 2 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 2 1H [m, J (Hz), 500 MHz] 13C a (125 MHz) 1, 10 2.80 (1H, s) – 2a, 20a 2.15 (1H, d, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0) 49.5 (t) 2b, 20b 2.37 (1H, d, J 2b,2a20b,20a=17.0) 3, 30 – 40.9 (s) 4 – 198.3 (s) 5, 40 – 163.9 (s) 6, 50 5.81 (1H, q, J6,1250,110=1.0) 126.1 (d) 7, 60 – b 8, 70 5.70 (1H, dd, J8,970,80 and 8,1270,110=15.5, 1.0) 128.6 (d) 9, 80 5.76 (1H, dd, J9,880,70 and 9,1080,90=15.5, 5.0) 135.6 (d) 10, 90 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80 and 10,1190,100=5.0, 6.5) 67.3 (d) 11, 100 1.20 (3H, d, J 11,10100,90=6.5) 23.4 (q) 12, 110 1.83 (3H, s) 19.0 (q) 13, 120 1.00 (3H, s) 22.7 (q) 14, 130 0.95 (3H, s) 23.8 (q) a Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment. b This signal was not observed in the 13C NMR spectrum. 524 R.

It is important to note that the inhibi- tion of C. sphaerospermum by dihydropyridone amide 9 appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of C. cladosporioides was lower than the standards (Table 4). 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck 230–400 mesh) was used for all col- umn chromatography unless otherwise stated and sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spec- trometer. ES–MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), ﬂow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were per- formed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser. 3.2. Plant material Piper arboreum H. B. K. leaves were collected in Araraquara—SP, Brazil and identiﬁed by Dr. Guil- lermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Bio- cie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. Piper tuberculatum Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA—Manaus, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher speci- mens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biocie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. 3.3. Antifungal assays The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C. cladospor- ioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Bota.nica, Sa˜ o Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay—10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds 1–5 and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds 6–13, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in dark- ness in a moistened chamber at 25 C. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of 1–5 and 6–13 required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chlor- amphenicol were used as negative controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents A CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of P. arboreum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides 1–4. The dried and powdered leaves of P. arboreum (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The result- ing EtOH extract was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively.

Fraction 19 (1.7 g) was applied to a C18 HPLC column (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). After that the fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2: (CH3)2CO (92:02) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 1 (28.0 mg) and 3 (31.0 mg). Fraction 21 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 col- umn (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC eluted with CH2Cl2:(CH3)2CO:MeOH (92:0.5:0.5) and HOAc (1%) to give 2 (8.0 mg). Fraction 23 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 column (2.0 g) and eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2:C6H14: (CH3)2CO (6:3:1) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 3 (83.0 mg) and 4 (30.0 mg). The dried and powdered seeds and leaves of P. tuber- culatum (24.3 g) were extracted 2 with 600 ml of CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1), during 2 days (each extraction), at room temperature. The resulting extract of seeds was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 8 (33.0 mg) and 10 (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yiel- ded 9 (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds 6 (0.2 g) and 7 (18.0 mg), respec- tively, without any further puriﬁcation. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26–62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier. Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide 8 (0.9 g), without further puriﬁcation. Amide 11 (7.0 mg) was isolated from fraction 55 (0.2 g), which was further puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O(4:1)]. Fraction 28 (0.4 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), two elutions] yielding the cinnamoyl derivative 12 (66.0 mg) and fraction 67–68 (0.4 g) was puriﬁed by two prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1), two elutions and C6H14: EtOAc (7:3), one elution], respectively, to yield the cin- namoyl derivative 13 (13.0 mg). 3.5.

(Rubiaceae), a huge endemic tree from the Amazon, has been traditionally used for the treatment of numerous human ailments including mycoses, inﬂuenza, diverse infections, cancer and skin diseases throughout ‘‘legal Amazonia,’’ which includes Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia (Correa, 1974; Rizzini, 1978; Garcia, 1975). In Peruvian Ama- zon, a decoction of the bark is used against ‘‘sarna negra’’, a subcutaneous infection caused by an arachnid (Schultes and Raﬀauf, 1990). In Brazilian Amazon, this species is known to treat stomach diseases, skin inﬂam- mation and uterus tumors (Garcia, 1975). As part of our continuing eﬀorts to study Brazilian Rubiaceae, mainly those with medicinal uses (Carbonezi et al., 1998), C. spruceanum DC was collected near Manaus, Amazon State, and submitted to a detailed chemical study. Three new seco-iridoids were obtained from the ethanolic extract of C. spruceanum wood bark: 7- methoxydiderroside (1), 60-acetyl-b-D-glucopyr- anosyldiderroside (2) and 8-O-tigloyldiderroside (3), and the known compounds loganetin (Houghton and Ming, 1985), loganin (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Garcia and Chulia, 1986), kingiside (Inouye et al., 1974), secoxyloganin (Calis and Sticher, 1984) and diderroside (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). Several natural products and synthetic compounds, e.g. sesquiterpenelactones from Asteraceae species (Chiari et al., 1991), lignans from Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae) (Lopes et al., 1998) and quinoline derivatives (Nakayama et al., 2001) have been evaluated for antitrypanosomal activity against T. cruzi, the parasite of Chagas disease, which aﬀects ca. 18 million people in Latin America and ca. 100,000 people in the United States. Besides prophy- laxis, i.e. the elimination of vector insect, speciﬁc ther- apeutic agents are needed in order to replace gentian violet, currently in use, owing to the mutagenic and 0031-9422/03/$ - see front matter # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the isolation and structure elucidation of the new seco-iridoids 1–3 along with the known compounds are presented. Additionally, the biological evaluation of all isolates against the try- pomastigote forms (Y form) of T. cruzi was undertaken. The taxonomic signiﬁcance of these seco-iridoids in C. spruceanum, is also discussed. 2. Results and discussion The ethanolic extract of dried and powdered wood bark of C. spruceanum was successively fractionated over a silica gel column and ﬁnally puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC (see Experimental), aﬀording the new seco-iridoids 1–3. seco-Iridoid 1 was isolated as an amorphous powder that gave a [M+H]+ ion at m/z 479.4539 in the high-resolution TOF-ESMS compatible with the molecular formula C20H30O13. The UV max- imum at 230 nm and IR absorptions at 3450, 1695, 1635 and 1280 cm1 suggested that 1 had a conjugated dou- ble bond and an enol ether, which is characteristic of the chromophore –OCO–C=CH–O– of iridoids. This assumption was supported by the NMR signal observed at 7.44 (1H, s) characteristic of H-3 from iridoids. Besides this signal, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed three doublets at 5.66 (1H, J=4.5 Hz), 4.54 (1H, J=7.5 Hz) and 1.26 (3H, J=6.5 Hz), one double quadruplet at 4.97 (1H, J=4.0; 6.5 Hz) and several signals compatible with a glucosyl unit. In addition, the signals at 1.92 (3H, s), 3.54 (3H, s) and 3.58 (3H, s) analyzed with 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 2), revealed the presence of an acetyl and two methoxyl groups. The 13C NMR spectroscopic spectrum exhibited twenty signals (4CH3, 2CH2, 10CH, and 4C) whose chemical shift values and multiplicities obtained from the DEPT-135 experiment strongly support the seco- iridoid skeleton for 1, especially the signals of C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9 and C-10 at 28.6, 34.7, 172.0, 68.6 and 42.2 respectively. The structure of 1 was conﬁrmed by 2D-NMR spectral analysis including 1H–1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments. In the HMBC experiment, long-range correlations were observed between the following protons and carbons (H-1 and C- 3, 5, 8, 10; H-3 and C-5, 11; H-5 and C-3, 7, 1; H-8 and C-1, 5, 10, carbonyl of acetate) as shown in Fig. 1. The relative conﬁguration of the stereogenic centers C-1, C- 5, C- 8 and C-9 was established by analyzing coupling constant values, NOESY experiments and comparison with literature data (Adeoye and Waigh, 1983). The above evidence indicated 1 as the new derivative 7- methoxydiderroside (1).

Zuleta et al. / Phytochemistry 64 (2003) 549–553 The 1H and 13C NMR spectral signals (Tables 1 and 2) for compound 2 were found to be similar to those observed for 1, except for the lack of one methoxyl group and one additional acetyl group. The change from one methoxyl to one acetyl group was also observed by HRTOF-ESMS, which showed a molecular ion peak at m/z [M+H]+ 507.4725. In fact, when the 13C NMR spectral data of compound 2 were compared with those of diderroside, the only diﬀerence observed was the presence of one addi- tional acetyl group inferred by the chemical shift values at 20.6 (correlating with the singlet at 2.00, in the HMQC spectrum), and 170.3. It was also observed that the sig- nals attributed to the hydroxymethylene carbon and hydrogens in the glucosyl unit are deshielded [ 63.4; 4.26 (dd, J=3.2, 12.0 Hz) and 4.06 (dd, J=6.5, 12.0 Hz)], when compared with the values observed in a typical glucose moiety present in iridoids (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980; Boros and Stermitz, 1990; Boros and Stermitz, 1991). From the HMBC spectrum of 2 (Fig. 1), the diagnostic long-range correlations were observed, including those from H-8 to the carbonyl at 169.3; from H-10 to C-8 and C-9; and from H-6 to the car- bonyl at 173.0. In addition, the correlation of H-60 to C-40 and C-50 as well as to the carbonyl at 170.3, established the position of the acetyl group at C-60. The cross peak observed for the methyl at 2.00 to the car- bonyl at 170.3, was deﬁnitive to indicate that this ace- tyl was linked to hydroxymethylene C-60 of the glucosyl moiety and establish the structure of 2 as being 60-ace- tyl-b-d-glucopyranosyldiderroside. Compound 3 was obtained as a brown amorphous solid. The molecular formula, C22H32O13 was estab- lished by HRTOF-ESMS (m/z 527.4797 [M+Na]+). This compound also presented a sulphuric vanillin col- oration identical to those of 1 and 2 suggesting that it was an iridoid. Its UV spectrum (lMeOH max 230, 297 nm), as well as its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data indicated that Fig. 1. Some selected HMBC correlations for seco-iridoids 1–3.

The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed one signal for hydrogen H-3 at 7.42 (1H, s), which suggested the presence of an iri- doid skeleton, a doublet at 4.59 (1H, J=8.0) and several signals ranging from 2.99 to 3.70 attributed to the anomeric, methine and methylene hydrogens of the glu- cosyl moiety. The signals at 5.09 (1H, dq, J=3.5, 6.5 Hz), and 1.30 (3H, d, J=6.5 Hz) were compatible with those from diderroside skeleton type for this compound, as in 1 and 2. However, additional NMR spectral sig- nals at 6.79, 1.76 and 1.74, and the signals at 137.4, 14.1 and 11.8, indicated that this compound exhibited signiﬁcant diﬀerences from the signals observed in diderrosides 1 and 2. The 1H–1H COSY spectrum from 3 showed a cross peak between the signal at 6.79 (1H, dq, J=1.5, 6.5) and the signal at 1.76 (3H, d, J=1.5). In the HMQC experiments the signals at 1.74 (3H, br s), 1.76 (3H, d, J=1.5) attributed to H-500 and H-400 respec- tively and 6.79 (1H, dq, J=1.5, 6.5), correlated with the carbons at 11.8 (C-500), 14.1 (C-400) and 137.4 (C-300), respectively. The combined analysis from these data and the presence of a sp2 carbon at 128.1 suggested the exis- tence of a tigloyl unit in this molecule, which was further determined to be linked at C-8 ( 68.6). The HMBC correlations between the signal for H-8 at 5.09 with car- bons C-100 ( 166.3), C-10 ( 18.8) and C-1 ( 94.1); H-3 at 7.42 with carbons C-11 ( 166.2), C-4 ( 109.1); methoxyl hydrogens with C-11; H-300 at 6.79 with C-400 ( 14.1), C- 200 ( 128.1) and C-100 ( 166.3) corroborated the proposed structure for 3 as 8-O-tigloyldiderroside. This is the ﬁrst report on the chemical composition of C. spruceanum, a species included in Cinchonoideae, which revealed the presence of iridoid and seco-iridoids, a che- mical proﬁle quite diﬀerent from those previously descri- bed (Bolzani et al., 1984). This sub-family is characterized by indole alkaloids, which are considered as their chemical markers (Young et al., 1996). A comparison of the chemi- cal composition of Calycophyllum with two species mor- phologically related such as Chimarrhis (accumulates indole alkaloids) and Bathysa (accumulates triterpenes and phenolics), revealed deep diﬀerences on the main isolated secondary metabolites. These species are often misplaced in their genera (Delprete, 1996), so further chemical studies on Calycophyllum and allies will be useful to establish the boundaries of each genera, and will con- tribute to the taxonomic classiﬁcation of Rubiaceae, which is considered a very complex taxon (Robbrecht, 1993). All compounds were assayed in vitro against the try- pomastigote forms (Y form) of T. cruzi. The new com- pounds 1, 2 and the known secoxyloganin and diderroside displayed activity with IC50 values of 59.0, 90.2, 74.2 and 84.9 mg/ml, respectively, when compared with the standard gentian violet (IC50 7.5 mg/ml). Although these compounds have showed weak activ- ities, to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report of the antitrypanosomal activity by seco-iridoids. 3. Experimental 3.1. General Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm and 25 C. UV spectra were recorded on Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectro- photometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on VARIAN DRX-500 spectro- meter, using TMS as internal standard. ES-MS was conducted on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRTOF-ESMS was performed using a Q-Tof (Micro- mass) (40 eV). CC was carried out on silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Sephadex LH 20 (Pharmacia), respectively. TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde- H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Prep HPLC was performed on Waters Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C-18 (250 mm 21.20 mm, Phenom- enex) columns. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated C. spruceanum plant material was col- lected in Manaus, Brazil, in July and August 1998. A voucher specimen was identiﬁed by Dr. J. A. da S. Cabral and deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazoˆ nia (INPA), Manaus (Voucher No 1998-182.249). 3.3. Bioassay screening In vitro assay using trypomastigote forms (Y strain) from T. cruzi was performed according to the protocol described in the literature (Bastos et al., 1999). 3.4. Extraction and isolation Pulverized dried wood bark from C. spruceanum (1.7 kg) was extensively extracted using MeOH at room temp. The combined extracts were concentrated in vacuo to give a dark solid (230 g), which was partitioned between n-BuOH and H2O aﬀording an n-BuOH (64 g) and an aqueous (107 g) soluble fraction. The n-BuOH fraction was suspended in aqueous MeOH 80% and suc- cessively partitioned with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction (20.8 g) was subjected to XAD-2 chro- matograph using H2O with increasing proportions of MeOH (20–100%). Fractions I and II, obtained from this procedure, were further submitted to CC using Sephadex LH 20 as stationary phase and MeOH as isocratic mobile phase, yielding 21 fractions (F1–F21). 552 L.M.C. Zuleta et al. / Phytochemistry 64 (2003) 549–553 F-5 was further puriﬁed by means of HPLC coupled to a prep reversed phase column using MeOH/H2O/HOAC (23:76.6:0.5) as mobile phase, UV detection set at 280 nm and a ﬂow rate of 10 mL.min1, gave pure loganin (11.6 mg), diderroside (5.3 mg) and the new derivative 3 (11.6 mg). F-11 was puriﬁed with a similar chromatographic procedure, only varying the mobile phase MeOH/H2O (27.5:72.5), giving diderroside (12.3 mg). Fraction F-18 was also subjected to HPLC puriﬁcation using MeOH/ H2O/HOAc (27:72.5:0.5) as mobile phase, ﬂow rate set at 8 mL.min1 to aﬀord secoxiloganin (5.7 mg), loganetin (2.0 mg), diderroside (2.1 mg) and the new compounds 1 (11 mg), 2 (13.6 mg) and 3 (1.2 mg). 3.4.1.

Abstract--The leaves of Tocoyena,/ormosa afforded two antifungal iridoids, ~- and fl-gardiol, and the new iridoids, mollugoside methyl ester and formosinoside. Formosinoside was characterized as its hexaacetyl derivative. 'L~ 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd I. INTRODUCTION Tocoyena.formosa (Chain. et Sch.) K. Shun, a small ornamental tree growing in dry regions of Central Brazil, is commonly known as 'genipapo do campo' and has very impressive yellow-green flowers [1]. In the course of our continuing search for bioactive con- stituents from rubiaceous species that grow in 'Cer- rado Regions' of Brazil [2-4], we investigated the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the 60% aqueous ethanol extract of leaves of T. Jormosa. In our mechanism- based bioassay for potential anticancer agents uti- lizing genetically-engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains [5], this extract exhibited moderate and nonselective activity on all the mutant strains tested suggesting the presence of antifungal agents rather than potential anticancer agents. Subsequent confirmation of its antifungal activity using Cla- dosporium cladosporioides and C. esphaerospermum [6] followed by bioassay-guided fractionation afforded four iridoids 1-4. Of these, ~-gardiol (1) and fl-gardiol (2) which were obtained as an inseparable mixture [7] exhibited antifungal activity. The third iridoid, mol- lugoside methyl ester (3), is being described here for the first time from a natural source. The fourth iridoid found to be new and hence named formosinoside (4), was characterized as its hexaacetate derivative (5). This paper deals with the structure elucidation of 5 and the antifungal activities of 1 and 2.

The ethyl acetate fraction on silica gel chromatography afforded three pure compounds identified as ~-gardiol (1), fl-gardiol (2) [5] (see Experi- mental) and mollugoside methyl ester (3) [8], and an inseparable mixture (3 : 1) of two compounds. These two compounds which were suspected to be isomers from NMR spectra of the mixture were separated via their peracetates to obtain the hexaacetate (5) c,f the major compound (4). Besides the iridoids, the ethyl esters of ferulic and caffeic acids were also isolated. Both are probably artifacts of aqueous ethanol extrac- tion.

The ~H NMR spectrum of 5 (Table 1) exhibited the presence of two olefinic protons at 8 5.55 and 8 5.80 (each 1H, dd, J = 6.0; 1.5 Hz, H-7 and dd, J = 6.0; 2.0 Hz, H-6). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum showed signals at 8 5.00 (1H, d, J = 5.8 Hz), 8 5.92 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz), 3 4.22 and 4.90 (2H, dd, J = 11.0; 8.0 and 11.0; 3.0 Hz), which were attributed to protons at C-l, C-3 and C-10, respectively. The remaining doublet at 8 5.93 (1H, J = 8.0 Hz) could be assigned to the anomeric proton from sugar moiety present in the molecule of 5. The ~H NMR also supported the presence of six acetyl groups as broad signals at 8 1.98 (corresponding two acetyl groups), 2.01, 2.02, 2.05 and 2.09. The 13C NMR of 5 (Table 1) showed signals due to two olefinic carbons at 8 134.62 and 136.57; a hexopyranose moiety (6 99.28, 76.08, 74.10, 73.70, 69.08 and 65.01); six acetyl groups; two hemiacetalic carbons at 8 91.52 and 98.06 and one --CH2-- carbon at 6 67.18. Detailed analysis of chemical shifts, with the aid of 2D NMR, mainly IH-~H COSY spectrum led us to suggest that this compound also had an iridoidal structure. It could belong to a structural type quite close to apodantheroside [9] with a double bond between C-6, C-7 and hydroxyl function at C-10. By assuming a iridoidal skeleton, and by comparison with carbon assignments of known iridoids, it was possible to assign the carboxyl group (8 180.29 s) to C-11. The structure of the iridoidal aglycone and the position of glycosidic linkage of 5 were further elucidated, as follows, by an extensive use of 2D NMR methods (1HJH COSY, HETCOR and COLOC). By COSY correlation it was possible to observe that a doublet at 6 5.00 (J = 5.8 Hz) was coupled to a double doublet at 3 3.00 (J = 9.0; 5.8 Hz) and a doublet at 6 5.92 coupled to a double doublet at 6 2.98 (J = 7.6; 2.0 Hz). In addition, the COSY-45 spectrum showed that the olefinic methine H-7 at 3 5.55 was correlated with methine H-8 at 3 3.08 (J = 9.0; 1.5 Hz); and an ABX system at 8 4.22 (J = 11.0; 8.0 Hz) and 4.90 (J = 11.0; 3.0 Hz) were due to the hydroxymethylene H-10. The HETCOR spectrum of 5 revealed that the methine at 6 99.28 was correlated with H-I' (8 5.93 d), wlhile the signal at 3 98.06 was correlated with H-1 (6:5.00 at). The correlations between methines 6 91.52 and H-3 (6 5.92 d); 3 46.56 and H-4 (8 2.98 dd); 3 42.44 and H-5 (3 3.53 ddd); 3 39.42 and H-8 (6 3.08 dd); 6 42.28 and H-9 (6 3.00 dd) were also confirmed. The COLOC spectrum (see Table 1) further confirmed the proposed structure and allowed unequivocal assignment of all ~H and ~3C NMR signals. NOE experiments per- formed on compound 5, dissolved in CDCI3, con- firmed the stereochemical assumptions on the relative orientation of acetoxyl, carboxyl and hyd- roxymethylene groups and permitted the assignment of the overall relative stereochemistry of the molecule Iridoids from Tocoyenaformosa AcO \"v ~ ~ 2~'H x Y._X) Fig. 1 as in Fig. 1. Particularly, irradiation of the signal for 9fl-H at 6 3.00 produced significant enhancement of the H-10 (~20%) methylene and methine 5fl-H (~35%). Furthermore, irradiation of I~-H showed simultaneous enhancement of the signals at 8a-H (12%) and 3ct-H (15%). These findings suggest that the acetoxyl group at C-3 and the hydroxymethylene at C-8 are in fl disposition. From iridoids derivatives isolated from T. formosa only the epimeric mixture of a- and fl-gardiol showed antifungal activity (Table 2). The fungitoxic properties of some iridoidal aglycones have already been observed in the case of Alibertia macrophylla [4] and seem to be an interesting feature of Rubiaceae growing in 'Cerrado Regions'.

The resulting extract was concd to half its original vol. and extracted with hexane followed by EtOAc. Evapn afforded hexane (3.00 g) and EtOAc (5.5 g) extracts. The EtOAc fr. was submitted to CC on silica gel and eluted with mixts of CHCI:~ and MeOH. A total of 28 frs were collected. Frs 9-11 were further purified by prep. TLC [silica gel, C6H6EtOAc (2:3) containing 3% HOAc] yielding an epimeric mixt. of 1 and 2 (42.5 mg) [5] and ethyl ferulate (19.4 mg). Frs 12-14 yielded, after prep.

The latter two compounds appear to be novel. @) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved INTRODUCTION Murraya paniculata (Linn.) Jack, which is native to Southeast Asia, was introduced to Brazil and has flourished in Slo Paulo state. In Brazil it is used as an ornamental plant, but this plant is used for its med- icinal properties in tropical and subtropical Asia [l]. A search for previous phytochemical studies of M. paniculuta revealed that only the coumarin, coumur- rayin, has been reported from the ripe fruits of this species [2]. Working separately on peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits, we have isolated only poly- methoxylated flavones, flavonols and flavanonols. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The dichloromethane extract of the peel of M. puniculata after successive chromatographic sep- arations afforded six flavonoids: 5,7,3’,4’,5’-penta- methoxyflavanonol[3,4], 5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxy- flavone (1) [5], 3,5,7,8,3’,4’,5’-heptamethoxyflavone (2) [6], 5,7,8,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavone (3) [7], 5- hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavone (4) and 8- hydroxy-3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyllavone (5). Com- pounds 4 and 5 appear to be novel. The i3C NMR data for 2 and 3 do not appear to have been reported in the literature. Thus, the 13C chemical shifts of 2 and 3 have been listed in Table 1 using 1 and 5,7,8,2’,3’,4’,5’-heptamethoxyflavone (6) [3] as models. The carbon signals of 1, isolated from *Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by R.J.F. to the Universidade Federal de Slo Carlos. t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Neoraputia magniJica (Rutaceae), were assigned by use of HMQC and HMBC experiments [5]. Compound 4 was obtained as a yellow powder. The presence of a flavonoid nucleus was suggested by its UV and IR spectra. In the ‘H NMR spectrum (Table 2) of 4, three aromatic protons appeared at 6 6.43 (lH, s) and 6 7.52 (2H, s, H-2’ and H-6’), one hydroxyl group at 6 12.38 (lH, s, OH-5) and six methoxy groups at 6 3.95 (6H, s), 3.94 (6H, s), 3.92 (3H, s), and 3.90 (3H, s). The assignment of one singlet to H-2’ and H- 6’ suggested that three methoxyls were attached to the B-ring. Furthermore, the singlet at 6 6.43 clearly indicated the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisub- stituted. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5- hydroxy-7,8- and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3,7,8- and 5-hydroxy-3,6,7-tri- methoxyflavonol indicated that the C-6 methine (ca 6 96) resonates at a lower field than the C-8 methine (ca 6 91) [3]. Thus, the correct A-ring structure was, decided on the basis of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table l), which showed a signal at 6 95.5 for C-6, so placing the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-8. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for three meth- oxyl groups at 6 61.5, 61.0 and 60.3, indicating a 3- methoxyflavonol derivative and confirming the oxy- genation patterns in the A and B-rings. This was cor- roborated by the fragments at m/z 207 [C12H,404- Me]+ and 181 [C9H805 -Me]+, associated with the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of the C-ring followed by the loss of a methyl group, respectively. From these data 4 was characterized as 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’,5’- hexamethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spec- trum with those of 4’,5-dihydroxy-3,3’,7,8-tetra- methoxyflavone (ternatin, 7) and 4’,5-dihydroxy- 393 R. J. FERRACIN et al. QMe 9 Me 1: RI = H, R2 = OMe 3:Rl=OMe,Rz=H P Me 10: RI = H, Rz = OMe 2:Rl=OMe,Rz=H P Me M 4: R3 = OMe 9:R3=H 3,3’,8-trimethoxy-7-(3-methylbut-2-enyloxy)-flavone (8) [8]. Complete and unambiguous r3C NMR assign- ments for 8 were made using the HMBC technique PI. Compound 5 exhibited similar NMR spectra to 4 (Table 1 and 2) except for the absence of the signal for one chelated hydroxyl. The mass spectrum indicated a molecular formula C2,H2209 ([Ml+ = 418), which strongly suggested an isomer of 4. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals for two methoxyl groups at 6 6 1.3 and 60.1, which were assigned to the 3- and 4’- positions. This implies that the methoxyls in the A-ring were located at C-5 and C-7 (6 56.4 and 56.1) and determined the position of the hydroxyl group at C-8. The 5,7,8- and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones can be differentiated by the 13C NMR chemical shifts of the unsubstituted methine which absorbs at 6 92.6 OH 0 7:&=OMe &Rq=OPre (C-6, for example 6) in the case of the former [3] and at 6 96.3 (C-8, for example 1) in the case of the latter. Thus, the 13C signal at 6 91.6 for C-6 supported the proposed structure of 5 as 8-hydroxy-3,5,7,3’,4’,5’- hexamethoxyflavone. A hexane-soluble fraction of the hydromethanolic extract of pulp after successive chromatographic sep- arations afforded three flavonols: 4, 9 and 10. Com- pound 4 could not be separated from a small amount of 9. The ‘H NMR in addition to signals described above for 4, revealed the presence of three protons in the B-ring, giving rise to an ABC coupling system (6 7.02, d, J = 8.8 Hz, H-5’; 6 7.81, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H- 2’, 6 7.86, dd, J = 8.8 and 2.0 Hz, H-6’). This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed frag- ments at m/z 177 [C1rHn03-Me]+ and 181 [C,Hs05 - Me]+ due to the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage Flavonoids from Murraya paniculata Table 1. “C NMR chemical shift for compounds 2-5 and 10 and selected carbons in the model compounds 1 and 6-g 395 C 1 2 3 6 4 7 8 5 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1’ 2 3’ 4 5’ 6 OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe 161.0 108.3 117.2 154.5 140.4 157.8 96.3 152.6 112.9 126.9 103.4 153.6 140.9 153.6 103.4 56.4 56.4 56.4 61.1 61.6 62.2 156.1 139.6 174.0 151.6 91.9 156.2 130.0 150.5 108.8 125.9 105.2 152.8 141.0 152.8 105.2 55.8 55.8 56.1 56.2 59.7 62.0 62.4 160.2 158.0 155.1 107.8 112.3 138.8 177.8 177.7 179.0 151.9 151.8 158.5 92.3 92.6 95.5 156.6 156.3 157.4 130.5 130.5 128.8 156.3 156.1 147.1 108.7 106.0 105.0 126.6 119.7 125.6 103.1 147.2 105.9 153.4 145.4 153.1 140.7 149.2 140.1 153.4 147.4 153.1 103.1 106.0 105.9 55.9 56.0 56.2 56.1 56.1 56.2 56.2 56.4 56.4 56.5 61.0 60.3 61.0 61.1 61.0 61.4 61.2 61.5 156.9 139.2 179.8 158.3 96.6 159.4 129.8 149.2 105.2 122.4 112.9 149.1 152.1 117.3 123.9 56.3 56.9 60.4 61.9 156.8 139.2 179.8 158.2 97.7 158.8 130.1 149.4 106.2 122.5 112.9 149.0 152.1 117.3 123.9 56.1 60.5 61.9 156.1 137.7 172.3 150.8 91.6 156.8 130.3 141.6 105.9 126.5 104.6 153.2 139.3 153.2 104.6 56.1 56.1 56.1 56.4 61.0 61.3 157.7 140.1 173.7 153.5 140.2 157.8 96.0 152.4 113.1 125.1 105.8 153.1 141.1 153.1 105.8 56.4 56.4 56.4 60.1 61.0 61.6 62.3 Table 2. ‘H NMR chemical shift for compounds 4,5 and 9 H 6 2 5 6 OH OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe OMe 4 6.43 s 7.52 s 7.52 s 12.38 s 3.90 s 3.92 s 3.94 s 3.94 s 3.95 s 3.95 s 5 6.42 s 7.61 s 7.61 s 3.92 s 3.93 s 3.95 s 3.95 s 3.95 s 4.02 s 9 6.43 s 7.81 d(2.0) 7.02 d (8.8) 7.86 dd (8.8,2.0) 12.47 s 3.89 s 3.91 s 3.93 s 3.96 s 3.98 s of the C-ring followed by loss of a methyl group, respectively. These data were consistent with the struc- ture of 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’-pentamethoxytlavone for 9, which has been found previously in Citrus retic- ulutu (tangerine peel) [9]. Compound 10 gave spectral data in agreement with those published for 3,5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hepta- methoxyilavonol [lo]. However, its 13C NMR data do not appear to have been reported previously in the literature. Thus, they have been listed in Table 1 using 1, 2 and 3 as models. A dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the meth- anolic pulp extract gave four flavonoids: 3, 5, 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanonol [3, 41 and 3,5,7, 8,3’,4’-hexamethoxyflavone [3, 111. Other organs of M. paniculata have long been the subject of extensive chemical investigations, which have proved that it is a rich source of coumarins, flavones and flavonols as are other plants of the Aur- antioideae [12]. The leaves have been reported to con- tain 2 [13], 3 [l, 131 and 10 [lo], while 3 has also been found in the roots [7]. Flavonol 1 has been isolated from the leaves of M. exotica [6], which has been considered to be a synonym of M. paniculata [14]. By contrast, the flowers appear to be poor in flavonoids. However, the only flavonol, 3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexame- thoxyflavone, reported from the flowers shows an oxi- dation level comparable to those of the leaves. Flavonol 9, 3,5,7,8,3’,4’-hexamethoxyflavone and 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanonol are reported for the first time from the Murruya, while the latter does not appear to have been recorded previously from the Rutaceae. EXPERIMENTAL General. NMR: Bruker ARX 400, with TMS as int. standard; GC-MS: low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument; R-HPLC (recycling HPLC): model Shi- madzu LC-6AD; the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 x 20 mm, 5 pm particle size, 100 A pore diameter; eluent: hexane-CH,Cl,MeOH (5:15:0.3); flow rate: 3.0 ml min-‘; detection (Shi- madzu SPD-6AV): UV 1254 nm. Plant material. Murrayapaniculata was collected in Slo Carlos, SP, Brazil and vouchers are deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Bioci&ncias, USP, SPo Paula. 396 R. J. FERRACIN et al. Isolation of compounds. The seeds, peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits were sepd by a perforated plate sieve (0.5 mm; tyler 32). The seeds and peel were dried, powdered and successively extracted with hexane, CH,C12 and MeOH. The pulp was stirred with MeOH at room temp. The extract was decanted, and the residual pulp similarly extracted a second time. The combined extracts were evapd under vacuum and the residue partitioned into hexane-, CH2C12-, MeOH- and n-BuOH-soluble frs. The coned CH2C1, extract of peel was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane- Me,CO (9:1), yielding 48 frs. Fr 23 was chro- matographed on silica gel using hexane-CH,Cl,- MeOH (10: 10: 1) as eluents affording further frs. Fr 23-4 purified x 2 by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane- CH#&MeOH, 1O:lO:l) to yield a mixt. of 1 and 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanonol (40 mg), which was sepd by R-HPLC (detection UV 1 254 nm) to give 1 (1st peak, 18 mg) and 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pent- amethoxyflavanonol (2nd peak, 16 mg), after recyc- ling x 3/ Fr 33 was purified by prep. TLC as above to afford 2 (15 mg), 3 (13 mg) and 4 (15 mg). Fr 50 was purified as above affording 5 (20 mg). The coned hexane-soluble pulp fr. was repeatedly purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexaneMe,CO, 3: 1) to yield 10 (20 mg) and a mixt. of 4 and 9 (15 mg). The coned CH,Cl,-soluble pulp. fr. was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a hexane-Me&O gradient afforded 5 (23 mg), 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pen- tamethoxyflavonol (20 mg), 3 (22 mg) and a mixt. of 2 and 3,5,7,8,3’,4’-hexamethoxyflavonol (38 mg) which was purified by RP-HPLC as above. 5-Hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavone (4).

Keywords: Piper aduncum; Piperaceae; Chromenes; Prenylated benzoic acid; Dihydrochalcone; Nerolidol; DNA-damaging activity 1. Introduction Chemical studies carried out on Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of a variety of com- pounds including essential oils, pyrones, lignoids and unsaturated amides (Parmar et al., 1997; AleÂ cio, Bolzani, Young, Kato, & Furlan, 1998). The species Piper aduncum L. is used as remedy for stomach aches and as an insect repellent (Asprey & Thornton, 1954). Previous investigations on P. aduncum have described phenylpropanoids, such as myristicin and dillapiol, benzoic acid derivatives, chromenes and ¯avonoids (Burke & Nair, 1986; Orjala, Eldelmeier, Wright, Rali, & Sticher, 1993a; 1993b; Moreira, GuimaraÄ es, & Kaplan, 1998). During the course of chemical studies on P. aduncum we isolated seven compounds, including a new chromene 1 and a new benzoic acid derivative 5. In the search for potential anticancer agents employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka, Samaranayake, Kingston, Hofmann, & Johnson, 1992; Gunatilaka, Kingston, & Johnson, 1994), it was found that the chromenes 2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3'-methyl-2'-butenyl)-2H-1-chromene- 6-carboxylate (2), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene- 6-carboxylate (3), methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-chromene-6-carboxylate (4) and the benzoic acid de- rivative, 3-(3',7'-dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-4-methoxy- benzoic acid (5), were active. Although chromene and benzoic acid derivatives are frequently isolated from Piper species and many of them exhibit diverse biologi- cal activity such as antimicrobial, molluscicidal (Orjala et al., 1993b), germination inhibition, fungicidal (Nair & Burke, 1990) and insecticidal activities (Bernard et al., 1995), there is no previous report describing dama- ging eect on DNA. In this paper we report the struc- ture elucidation for two new isolated compounds 1 and 5 and the growth inhibitory eects of compounds 1±5 against strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Results and discussion A CH2Cl2-soluble part of MeOH extract of the leaves of P. aduncum was fractionated by CC on silica gel followed by HPLC to aord compounds 1±5, nero- lidol and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone. 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1) was shown to have a molecular formula C12H12O3 by analysis of its electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS), 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 2400±3400/1680 and 1600/1445 cmÿ1 characteristic of carboxylic acid and aromatic groups, respectively. Its 1H NMR spectrum exhibited close similarities to those of 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chro- mene-6-carboxylate 3 (Burke & Nair, 1986) by the pre- sence of two doublets at d 5.65 and 6.34 (9.9 Hz) and a singlet at d 1.46 (2 CH3) and, as in the case of 3, its spectrum showed three aromatic signals at d 7.86 (dd, J=2.0 and 8.4 Hz), 7.72 (d, J=2.0 Hz) and 6.79 (d, J=8.4 Hz), corroborating the presence of a trisubsti- tuted aromatic ring. As indicated by IR and by 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1), the methyl ester func- tion in 3 was replaced by a carboxylic acid function (dC 171.0) and the structure of compound 1 was deter- mined as depicted. 3-(3',7'-dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (5) has the molecular formula C18H22O4 deduced by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and 13C NMR data. In its IR spectrum, absorptions for an aromatic acid carbonyl group (1680 cmÿ1) and an aromatic ring (1600, 1490 cmÿ1) were present, while the UV spectrum displayed an absorption maximum at 254 nm (log E 3.8) corresponding to the aromatic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 5 showed sig- nals corresponding to three coupled aromatic reson- ances at d 6.87 (d, 1H, J=8.4 Hz), 7.88 (d, 1H, J=2.2 Hz) and 7.96 (dd, 1H J=8.4, 2.2 Hz) for a 1,4,5-tri- substituted aromatic ring and dH 1.34 (1H, s); it also displayed a singlet at 3.90 (3H, s) for a carboxylic acid Table 1 1H and 13C NMR (200 and 50 MHz, respectively, CDCl3, J in Hertz) data for compounds 1 and 5 1 5 H Ca H Ca 1 ± ± ± 122.5 (s) 2 ± 77.2 (q) 7.88 d (2.2) 130.8b (d) 3 5.65 d (9.9) 131.0 (d) ± 129.7b (s) 4 6.34 d (9.9) 121.4 (d) ± 160.7 (s) 4a ± 120.7c (s) ± ± 5 7.72 d (2.0) 128.7 (d) 6.87 d (8.4) 109.2 (d) 6 ± 121.5c (s) 7.96 dd (8.4, 2.2) 129.3 (d) 7 7.86 dd (8.4, 2.0) 131.8 (d) ± ± 8 6.79 d (8.4) 116.3 (d) ± ± 8a ± 157.9 (s) ± ± 9 1.46 28.4 (q) ± 10 1.46 28.4 (q) ± 1' ± ± 3.34 d (7.3) 28.0 (t) 2' ± ± 5.31 t (7.3) 121.6 (d) 3' ± ± ± 136.1 (s) 4' ± ± 2.07 m 39.8 (t) 5' ± ± 2.07 m 26.4 (t) 6' ± ± 5.10 t (7.2) 124.0 (d) 7' ± ± ± 131.0 (s) 8' ± ± 1.67 s 25.4 (q) 9' ± ± 1.71 s 15.8 (q) 10' ± ± 1.60 s 17.4 (q) OCH3 ± ± 3.90 s 55.2 (q) COOH ± 171.0 (s) ± 168.4 (s) a Multiplicities for carbon signals were obtained by DEPT 1358 ex- periments. b Interchangeable assignments. c Interchangeable assignments. D. Cristina Baldoqui et al. / Phytochemistry 51 (1999) 899±902 900 function and an aryl methoxyl group, which were con- ®rmed by the signals at dC 168.4 and 55.2, respectively, in its 13C NMR spectrum. The monoterpene side chain signals were determined from DQCOSY and HETCOR spectra. Thus, the methylene protons H-1' at d 3.34 (2H, d, J=7.3 Hz) were coupled to the ole®- nic proton H-2' at d 5.31 (1H, t, J=7.3 Hz), which in turn showed an allylic coupling to the methyl group H-9' at d 1.71 (3H, s). The methine proton H-6' at d 5.10 (1H, t, J=7.2 Hz) was further coupled to the methylene proton H-5' at d 2.07 (2H, m). The E geo- metry for the D2'3'-double bond was established on the basis of the 13C NMR data of the vinyl methyl group H-9' (De Haan & van de Ven, 1973). The position of the monoterpene moiety was deduced by NOESY spectrum analysis and by comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data with those published for methyl 3-(3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienyl)-4-methoxy- benzoate (Orjala et al., 1993b). The known compounds 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3-methyl-2- butenyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate (2), methyl 2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (3), methyl 8- hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (4) and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone were previously isolated from the same source (Burke & Nair, 1986; Diaz, Arias, & Nathan, 1987; Orjala et al., 1993a; Moreira et al., 1998), while nerolidol (Ramos, Da Silva, Luz, Zoghbi, & Maia, 1986) was isolated for the ®rst time from P. aduncum. Compounds 1±5 were evaluated against genetically engineered mutants of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have showed IC12 values of 120 and 100; 130 and 100; 105 and 120; 110 and 120; 130 and 120 mg/ml against the mutant yeast strains RS 321N and RS 322YK (rad 52Y), respectively. Even though the ac- tivity could be considered weak, they were selective towards mutant strains lacking DNA cleavage repair mechanism since they were inactive (IC12>1,000 mg/ ml) against the `wild type' strain RS 188N (rad +) (Gunatilaka et al., 1992; 1994). As there is no previous report on the activity of chromene compounds on DNA, the data obtained here are the basis for our further search for antitumoral or fungicidal com- pounds in the Piperaceae. 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck 230±400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, re- spectively, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as refer- ence. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES±MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were per- formed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reversed phase column (Waters Nova Pak, C18; 3.9 150 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (3:2), ¯ow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. 3.2. Plant material Piper aduncum L. (Piperaceae) leaves were collected at Reserva da Ripasa, IbateÂ , SP and identi®ed by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, PeruÂ ). The voucher specimen is deposited at Departamento de Ecologia, Instituto de BiocieÃ ncias-USP. 3.3. Bioassays The screening methods utilizing mutant strains of S. cerevisiae have been described elsewhere (Gunatilaka et al., 1992). IC12 values refer to the concentration in mg/ml required to produce an inhibition zone of 12 mm diameter around a 100 ml well during a 48 h incu- bation period at 378C. The positive control camptothe- cin was active at 5.0 ml/ml for RS 322YK and at 200 ml/ml for RS 188N; streptonigrin was active at 4.0 ml/ ml for RS 321N. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents The CH2Cl2-soluble part of MeOH extract of pow- dered leaves of P. aduncum (24.0 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane con- taining increasing volumes of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 46 fractions (A1±A46). Fraction A3 (961.5 mg) was applied to a silica gel column (2.5 g) 230±400 mesh, eluted with hexane containing increasing concen- trations of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 14 fractions (B1±B14). Fraction B2 aorded compound 2 (13.0 mg). Fraction A4 (218.0 mg) was chromatographed via silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 10 fractions (C1±C10). Fraction C5 (133.0 mg) yielded pure com- pound 3 (23.0 mg). Fraction A5 was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give ner- olidol (180 mg). Fraction A11 (675.6 mg) yielded the pure compound 4 (171 mg). Fraction A13 (980.0 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 90%) to give the compound 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'- methoxydihydrochalcone (408.0 mg). Fraction A14, a green gum (25.0 mg), was further puri®ed by reversed- phase HPLC, as described in the general experimental procedures, to give 5 (12.3 mg). The dried and pow- dered leaves (1.003 g) of P. aduncum were extracted D. Cristina Baldoqui et al. / Phytochemistry 51 (1999) 899±902 901 with EtOAc (®ve times, 150 ml each). The resulting extract (325.6 mg) was dissolved in CHCl3 and parti- tioned with an aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (six times, 50 ml each). The aqueous fraction was neutral- ized with HCl (6 N) and submitted to partition with EtOAc (three times, 100 ml each) to give a residue (248.0 mg). This fraction (248.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC eluted with CHCl3:MeOH (98:2) and HOAc (1%) to give 12.0 mg of compound 1. 2,2-Dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1): amorphous solid; UV (MeOH) lmax (log E ): 240 nm (1.9); IR nmax (KBr): 2400±3400, 3010, 2920, 2870, 1680, 1610, 1485, 1440, 1135 cmÿ1; ES±MS m/z (rel int): 205 [M+1] (100); 1H and 13C NMR, see Table 1. 3-(3',7'-Dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (5): amorphous solid; UV (MeOH) lmax (log E): 254 nm (3.8); IR nmax (KBr): 2400±3400, 3005, 1680, 1640, 1600, 1488, 1445, 1130 cmÿ1; ES±MS m/z (rel int): 303 [M+1] (100); 1H and 13C NMR, see Table 1.

A literature analysis pointed out its importance as a source of prenylated bioactive molecules. The screening performed on aromatic acceptors (benzoic acids, phenols and phenylpropanoids) including geranyl diphosphate as prenyl donor, showed the biotransfor- mation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid by the crude extract, and the p-hydroxybenzoic acid by both the microsomal fraction and the crude extract, after treating leaves with glucose. The analysis of the products allowed the identiﬁcation of C- and O-geranylated derivatives, and the protease (subtilisin and pepsin) inhibition performed on the O-geranylated compounds showed weak inhibition. Electrophoretic proﬁles indicated the presence of bands/spots among 56–58 kDa and pI 6–7, which are compatible with pren- yltransferases. These ﬁndings show that P. crassinervium could be considered as a source of extracts with geranyltransferase activity to perform biotransformations on aromatic substrates. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

They are different from biosynthesis, where complex products are assembled from simple substrates by whole cells, organs or organisms. Plant enzyme biocatalysts can be uti- lized to introduce new structural motifs on existing drugs expect- ing to improve their bioactivity, pharmacokinetic proﬁle and also for the production of new drugs (Giri et al., 2001). So far, natural products bearing one or more prenyl groups have been isolated predominantly from higher plants. These com- pounds, originated from several natural product classes, often hold antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, antiviral, and anti- cancer activities (Epifano et al., 2008). Since the prenylation of small aromatic molecules is a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of many natural products, the access to prenylation reaction catalysts might represent an advantageous short-cut to obtain prenylated aromatic compounds (Yazaki et al., 2001; Haagena et al., 2007). Aromatic geranyltransferases are a sub-class of prenyltransfe- rases that catalyzes C-geranylations on several aromatic sub- strates. Several examples of new aromatic prenyltransferases have been reported from bacteria as soluble monomeric biocata- lysts, with a relatively high promiscuity for aromatic substrates. In spite of the lack of a full elucidation of substrate- and regio- speciﬁcity, these enzymes were successfully employed to carry out either C- or O-prenylations of several compounds (Epifano et al., 2008). In plants, aromatic geranyltransferases are mem- brane-bound proteins, showing a strict substrate speciﬁcity for the endogenous prenyl donor groups (e.g. DMAPP, GPP, etc.), although they may accept a variety of aromatic compounds as acceptors of the prenyl moieties (Yazaki et al., 2001; Kuzuyama et al., 2005). There are few examples in which prenyltransferases have been isolated and characterized from plants (Mühlenweg et al., 1998). Therefore, biotransformations using plant enzymatic extracts enriched in prenyltransferase activity could be used as an alternative to obtain either known or new bioactive compounds. Piperaceae family is a basal angiosperm family, comprising more than 4000 species. Its species are chemically very rich and major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Parmar et al., 1997; Bene- vides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003; Felippe et al., 2008), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alécio et al., 1998; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005).

Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Bioresource Technology journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/biortech family, Piper is one of the most abundant genera, with approxi- mately 2000 species (Wanke et al., 2007). Piper crassinervium spe- cies accumulates antifungal, trypanocidal and antioxidant C- geranylated metabolites derived from both benzoic acid and p- hydroquinone (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008). In spite of the knowledge on the chemical constituents and the biological potential of Piperaceae species, no comprehensive study has been made in order to survey such bioactive metabolites with- in the members of the family. Here we present a compilation that points out to the impor- tance of Piper genus as a source of bioactive compounds and, par- ticularly, of P. crassinervium as an enzyme source to perform geranylations on aromatic substrates. We report the biotransfor- mation (i.e. the geranylation) of both the p-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids carried out by the enzymatic extracts from the leaves of P. crassinervium besides the full characterization of two products as geranyl ester derivatives in addition to the char- acterization of one major product formed by biotransformation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a C-geranylated derivative. Addi- tionally, the inhibitory activity on HIV-like proteases was determined for the products as well as the electrophoretic charac- terization of catalytically active protein fractions by using SDS PAGE and 2-DE. 2. Methods 2.1. Literature survey and analysis ‘Piperaceae’ and ‘activity’ were used as key words to perform a search in the available databases (e.g. Science Direct and ACS dat- abases). All the obtained information was uploaded in a table according to genus, species, type of compound and biological activ- ity reported (see the Electronic Annex in the online version of this article). Typical software Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation) was used to analyse and plot the obtained information. 2.2. Plant material Fresh leaves of P. crassinervium were collected from adults spec- imens cultivated from seeds under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara, SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo-Peru) and the voucher specimen (Kato-0084) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Incubation into b-D-glucose of young leaves from P. crassiner- vium. Leaves freshly excised from an adult plant were placed sep- arately in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and each administrated 100 ll from a 10% solution of b-D-glucose in water at 25 C for 72 h (Berg- amo et al., 2005). 2.3. Synthesis and puriﬁcation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) In a 100 ml round bottom ﬂask 1 mmol of geraniol was mixed with 6 mmol of trichloroacetonitrile. Bis-triethylammonium phos- phate (2.4 mmol in 20 ml of acetonitrile) was added drop-wise to the mixture over a period of 6 h, at room temperature under con- tinuous stirring (Cornforth and Popják, 1969). The mixture was fur- ther stirred for 12 h at room temperature and then, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 100 ml of ethyl ether, followed by extraction with 30 ml of NH4OH 0.1 M (3). The basic solution was then re-extracted with 30 ml of ethyl ether (3) and evapo- rated under reduced pressure. The GPP was puriﬁed by precipita- tion in acetonitrile at 20 C overnight, compared with a commercial sample using TLC on cellulose (isopropanol/25% aque- ous ammonia/water 50:25:25) and characterized by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): d 4.44 (H-1, d, J = 7.0 Hz), 5.41 (H-2, t, J = 7.0 Hz), 2.02–2.15 (H-4 and H-5, m), 5.17 (H-6, m), 1.59 (–CH3 8, s), 1.65 (–CH3 9, s), 1.66 (–CH3 10, s). 13C NMR (125 MHz, D2O): d 63.0 (C-1), 124.3 (C-2), 143.0 (C-3), 46.9 (C-4), 25.8 (C-5), 120.0 (C- 6), 133.9 (C-7), 25.0 (C-8), 17.2 (C-9) and 15.8 (C-10). 31P NMR (H3PO4, 202 MHz, D2O): d 9.75 (P-1), 10.40 (P-2). 2.4. Synthesis, puriﬁcation and characterization of the O-geranyl derivatives of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid To a stirred solution of the 3,4-dihydroxibenzoic acid (2 mmol) in dry DMF (10 ml), anhydrous potassium carbonate (6 mmol) was added and the solution stirred for 30 min at 40 C under nitrogen atmosphere (Pisco et al., 2006). Geranyl bromide (4 mmol) was added drop-wise and the resulting mixture was heated and stirred at the same temperature for 8 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then poured into cold water (50 ml) added with 0.1% of HOAc, and extracted with CHCl3 (100 ml) and EtOAc (100 ml). The EtOAc layer was washed, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was submitted to column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230–400 mesh), iso- cratic elution with Hex–EtOAc (60:40)] yielding ﬁve fractions. Fraction 2 was characterized as compound 3, fraction 4 as com- pound 4 and fraction 5 as compound 5. The puriﬁed products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Fig. 4, Table 1). 2.5. Synthesis, puriﬁcation and characterization of the O-geranyl derivatives of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid The p-hydroxybenzoic acid (1 mmol) dissolved in 5 ml of THF was added to a slurry of 5 g of Al2O3 neutral in ether (1 ml) (Glü- senkamp and Büchi, 1986). The solvent was evaporated and gera- nyl bromide (3 mmol) in ether–hexane (30:70) was added. After stirring during 4 days, Al2O3 was ﬁltered off and washed with 1% HOAc in EtOAc. The combined organic layer was evaporated and the products were puriﬁed using column chromatography [Silica- gel 60 (230–400 mesh), gradient elution with Hex 100%, Hex– EtOAc (90:10; 80:20; 50:50)], yielding 7 fractions. From fraction 3 it was characterized the geranyl ester derivative (6), whereas the geranyl ether derivative (7) was puriﬁed from fraction 4 by subsequent column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230–400 mesh), isocratic elution with Hex–EtOAc (80:20)]. The puriﬁed products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Table 2, Fig. 5). 2.6. Protein extraction Leaves of P. crassinervium were harvested from an adult speci- men and maintained in liquid N2. The frozen leaves (10 g) were triturated in a mortar with addition of 35% polyvinylpolypyrroli- done (PVPP), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM ethylenedi- aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 30 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 8). The homogenate was stirred slowly by 15 min in ice bath, ﬁltered on gauze and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant (crude enzymatic extract), which was then submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis. 2.7. Microsomal fraction The protocol was performed according to Mühlenweg et al. (1998) with minimal modiﬁcations. The supernatant (20 ml) ob- tained as described in Section 2.6 was subjected to ultracentrifuga- 4252 S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 tion at 39,000 rpm for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 1 M KCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol, and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspen- sion was subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. The supernatant was discarded, and the tube was carefully rinsed with 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5). The pellet was then resuspended in 10 ml of 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 6.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 2 M KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 4 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammo- nium]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPSO), and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspension was ultracentrifuged as described above, and the desired proteins were recovered as supernatant, which was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (9.0 cm long, 1.0 cm i.d.), previously equilibrated with the 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1.5 mM CHAPSO, 2 mM DTT and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The eluate was submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis. 2.8. Protein determination The protein determination was performed by the Bradford modiﬁed method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard (Stoscheck, 1990). 2.9. Detection of the geranyltransferase activity The reaction mixture (100 ll) containing 100 mM KPi (pH 8.0), 10 mM of precursors, 10 mM GPP, 10 mM MgCl2 (or MnCl2) and 65 ll of the proteic extract was incubated under stirring for 60 min at 35 C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 5 ll of 6 M HCl and extracted with 150 ll of EtOAc. After vortex and centrifugation, the organic layer was evaporated, the residue dissolved in MeOH (100 ll) and analysed by HPLC–UV, using a Phenomenex GEMINI column (5 lm C18 110 Å, 250 4.6 mm) at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic condition (25 min) con- sisted of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous HOAc (30%), with detection at 254 and 280 nm. Injection volume: 50 ll. For each reaction, two negative controls, which consisted of: (1) enzymatic extract + buffer and (2) precursor + divalent cation + GPP + buffer, were carried out simultaneously. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. 2.10. Sodium dodecylsulphate–polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS– PAGE) The SDS PAGE was performed according to the supplier infor- mation (GE Healthcare). The 12% polyacrylamide gels were stained with AgNO3. The relative molecular mass (Mr) of denatured proteins was estimated using the LabImage 1D software cali- brated with low molecular weight standards (phosphorylase b, sericalbumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase and trypsin inhibi- tor, with 97.4, 66.2, 45.0, 31.0, 21.5 and 14.4 kDa, respectively). 2.11. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) The 2-DE with immobilized pH gradients (IPG-Dalt) was carried out according to the supplier information (GE Healthcare). The IPG strips (13 cm) were rehydrated for 14–18 h with sample pro- teins previously treated with the Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare) Table 1 1H NMR data (500 MHz, J = Hz, CDCl3), 13C NMR data (125 MHz, CDCl3) and gHMBC correlations observed for compounds 3–5.

First dimension iso- electric focusing (IEF) was carried out in an Ettan IPGphor II Man- ifold applying a manufacturer’s standard protocol. The second dimension was performed on a vertical (14 16 cm) 12% poly- acrylamide SDS gel, in a SE 600 Ruby System, 45 mA/gel and 600 V. Each gel was stained with silver according to the Silver Staining Protocol (Amersham Biosciences). 2.12. Inhibition of the protease activity 2.12.1. Reagents Pepsin was from porcine gastric mucous. Recombinant Type VIII Subtilisin Carlsberg, Arg-Glu-(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile- Val-Gln-Lys-(DABCYL)-Arg ﬂuorogenic substrate (EDANS-DABCYL) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) spectrophotometric grade, were from Sigma–Aldrich, São Paulo, Brazil. 2.12.2. Protease activity assay The assays were performed in triplicate. Compounds were dis- solved in DMSO and diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) for subtilisin and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.4) for pepsin, respec- tively. Warfarin and dicoumarol were used as positive controls (Thaisrivongs et al., 1994; Pochet et al., 2000). Samples and stan- dard inhibitors (1 lg/ml) were pre-incubated with subtilisin (37 nM) or pepsin (1.7 nM) for 1 h, and then transferred to a black opaque microplate to be tested. The substrate EDANS-DABCYL (2 lM) was prepared in the speciﬁc buffer for each protease. In the control assay only protease and substrate were used. Proteases were prepared in the day of the experiment and the tests were per- formed for each one separately. Readings were made using 360 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission) ﬁlters during 7 min, with 1 min intervals, at 37 C (Hirata et al., 2005). The ﬂuorescence intensity was used to calculate the % of inhibition as follows: %I ¼ 100 ½ðDFs=DFpÞ 100 where, DFs and DFp are the difference between the ﬁrst and last readings for the sample test and the control, respectively. Fluorescence bioassay data were collected with a multidetec- tion microplate reader Synergy™HT and analysed using the KC4 software (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) and Microsoft Windows XP. 3. Results and discussion Prenylation is a chemical or enzymatic addition of a hydropho- bic side chain to an accepting molecule (another terpenoid mole- cule, an aromatic compound, a protein, etc.). In particular, the prenylation of aromatic secondary metabolites plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of a wide range of molecules exerting valuable pharmacological effects. Several examples can be found in phylo- genetically different classes of living organisms, from bacteria across mammals to plants (Epifano et al., 2008). Phytochemical investigations carried out on Piper species have led to the isolation of many bioactive natural products. The analy- sis of the distribution of these bioactive compounds (by genus, type of compound and bioactivity) in the Piperaceae family was performed looking at, particularly, the importance of prenylated natural products within that universe. The search was performed using ‘Piperaceae’ and ‘activity’, as key words, in the available web databases. This search resulted in 656 entries (see the Elec- tronic Annex in the online version of this article), which were ana- lysed and discussed here. The analysis was performed considering the botanical classiﬁcation as provided in the publications. Regarding the distribution of bioactive compounds reported within genera, a predominance of Piper genus over Peperomia genus was observed, representing 83%. In spite of the large number of species belonging to Peperomia genus (about 1700 species ver- sus 2000 from Piper) (Wanke et al., 2007), it only contributes with 15% of the total reports published. Such differences can be ac- counted for the fact that Piper species have been more exhaustively Table 2 1H NMR data (500 MHz, J = Hz, CDCl3) for compounds 6 and 7. 13C NMR data (125 MHz, CDCl3) and gHMBC correlations for compound 6.

López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 studied partially due to their wide occurrence and biomass avail- ability (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex). Among Piper genus, 44 species were subjected to phytochemical or bioactivity investigations, being P. cubeba the most intensively studied with near 8%, followed by P. longum and P. aduncum with 7%, P. methysticum and P. tuberculatum with 6%, P. sanctum, P. ni- grum and P. crassinervium with 5% (Fig. 1). Only nine studies with Peperomia species were found, with P. duclouxii (28%), P. dindygul- ensis (18%) and P. galioides (13%), being the three mentioned most frequently. Considering the type of compounds, they were grouped based on their structural characteristics, as follows: ALK (alkaloids and other substances bearing nitrogen), LG (lignans, neolignans and re- lated compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPPR (preny- lated benzopyrans), HQPR (prenylated hydroquinones), BPR (prenylated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (ﬂavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopyr- anes), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (steroids), CHX (cyclohexanic derivatives), KLN (kavalactones, pyr- ones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives), (Fig. 2A). Their distribution shows the prevalence of nitrogenated substances (ALK), lignoids (LG) and ﬂavonoids (FLV) in Piper spe- cies. Nevertheless some differences could be observed in Pepero- mia, where LG (lignoids) and BPPR (prenylated benzopyrans) were the most abundant (Fig. 2A). Regarding biological activities, the grouping was performed considering the biological target in order to simplify as follows: snc (involving activities related to central nervous system, such as sedative and relaxant), tryp (antiprotozoal activity against Try- panosoma, Plasmodium, Leishmania), cyt (cytotoxicity and related activities), atb (antimicrobial, such as antibacterial and antifungal), can (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more speciﬁcally targeted), insec (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti- mosquito or ant), aox (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), enz (inhibiroty activity against several enzymes), aai (anti-inﬂamma- tory activity), acoag (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), iger (allelophatic activity), photo (photo-protecting activity), cic (cicatrizing activity) and avir (antiviral activity). The obtained distribution shows that Piper genus is mostly related to antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities, followed by anti-inﬂam- matory and enzymatic inhibitory activities, while Peperomia ap- pears to be mostly related to cytotoxic and antiprotozoal activities. Only Pothomorphe genus showed some relationship with antiviral activity (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2. (A) Distribution by type of bioactive compounds reported by genera in Piperaceae family.

S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 4255 About prenylated natural products, i.e., all the compounds bear- ing one or more prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moie- ties as substituents in their basic structures, open or cycled (BP, BPR, BPPR and HQPR), they could be found in Peperomia, Pothomor- phe and in Piper species (Fig. 2). In addition, they are mostly related to antimicrobial (atb), insecticidal (insec) and antioxidant activity (aox), being the prenylated benzoic acid derivatives (BPR) from Pi- per species, the group with the most biological activities reported (Fig. 3). The analysis for the occurrence of major secondary compounds pointed out that Piper species could be considered as an important source of prenylated compounds and thus a source for further studies of prenyltransferase activity. The two species P. crassinervi- um and P. aduncum accounted for 11% of the total number of spe- cies in which bioactive substances have been reported for this genus and can be considered good candidates for further investiga- tion on bioactive prenylated metabolites (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex). Considering the literature survey performed here as well as our previous experience on both bioactivity and biosynthetic studies of prenylated compounds from some Piper species, P. crassinervium was selected for further studies (Lopes et al., 2008). This species accumulates two C-geranylated metabolites derived from benzoic acid [4-hydroxy-3-E-(30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20,60-octadienyl)ben- zoic acid (1)] and from 1,4–benzenediol [(1,4-dihydroxy-2-E- (30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20,60-octadienyl)benzene (2)], which showed antifungal, antioxidant and trypanocidal activities (Fig. 1) (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008). A screening for the prenylation activity with the crude enzy- matic extract from fresh leaves of P. crassinervium plus geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as the prenyl donor, a divalent cation (MgCl2 or MnCl2) and several aromatic substrates (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phenol, p- hydroquinone, caffeic acid, o- and p-coumaric acids) was initially performed. Neither the p-hydroxybenzoic acid nor the p-hydroqui- none (the two theoretically natural precursors of compounds 1 and 2) was biotransformed, whilst the reaction with the 3,4-dihydroxy- benzoic acid led to the formation of products, as observed in the chromatographic proﬁle, suggesting a biotransformation reaction when compared with that of the negative control. The reaction was consistently reproducible and the product was analysed by HPLC–UV–MS showing an intense peak at tR: 13.1 min with kmax at 280 nm besides some minor compounds between tR: 7–9 min (Fig. 4). The fact that the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid could be bio- transformed is interesting because no prenylated natural products bearing a catechol moiety have been isolated from P. crassinervium previously. The characterization of the biotransformation products was performed by the analysis of their UV–Vis and MS or tandem MS–MS (ESI negative mode) spectra, as well as by comparison with synthetic compounds prepared for this purpose: the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid geranyl ester (compound 3), the 4-O-geranyl- 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound 4) and the 3-O-geranyl-4- hydroxybenzoic acid (compound 5) (Table 1). Regarding the minor products detected (chromatographic peaks detected at 254 nm with tR between 7 and 9 min), their mass (MS) spectra were investigated and compared to those of the synthetic compounds 3–5. This analysis and the comparison of the chro- matographic proﬁles, UV (Amax 258 and 295 nm) and MS spectra ([MH] = 289, [MC10H17] = 153 and [MC10H17CO2] = 109) with those of the negative controls (see Section 2.9) allowed the determination of the product eluted at tR: 8.6 min as the geranyl ester of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3) (Fig. 4). The compound eluted at tR: 13.1 min displayed a [MH] = 303, which under subsequent fragmentation by MS–MS, gave rise to the fragment ion m/z = 259, indicating the loss of a CO2 molecule (Fig. 4). Considering that the addition of one geranyl moiety to this aromatic core produces a molecule with MW = 290, an additional oxidation at the geranylic chain was suggested on the basis of the MW = 304 observed, compatible with additional 14 unities to the MW = 290. This suggestion was based on the observation of the oxidation pattern of the isolated metabolites 1 and 2, which have a carbonyl carbon at their geranyl moieties (Fig. 1). The posi- tion of the geranyl moiety could be proposed as a C- (at the aro- matic ring) instead of an O-substitution (at a phenol group), due to the lack of the fragment at m/z = 153 in the MS–MS spectrum (Fig. 4). The position of the oxidation at the geranyl moiety was as- sumed to be at C-50, due to the observation of the fragment ions at m/z = 203 and 159, which could result from a McLafferty-type rear- rangement (Fig. 4) (Grossert et al., 2006). Since plant prenyltransferases are mostly membrane-associated enzymes, an additional protocol on the crude extract was per- formed to obtain a microsomal fraction (Mühlenweg et al., 1998). The process was monitored by electrophoresis SDS PAGE and 2- DE, and the microsomal fraction was evaluated for its geranyl- transferase activity having p-hydroquinone, p-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids as aromatic acceptors. No prod- ucts were detected when p-hydroquinone and 3,4-dihydroxyben- zoic acid were used as substrates. Nevertheless, the analysis indicated that the p-hydroxybenzoic acid was biotransformed yielding a new product as a weak chromatographic peak (tR: 13.6 min), absent in the negative controls. The chromatographic proﬁle of the obtained product was compared with those of the endogenous (1) and synthetic (6 and 7, Table 2) compounds, sug- gesting that the product of this biotransformation could be an O- geranylated derivative (Fig. 5). Previous studies carried out by our research group with leaves of P. crassinervium have demonstrated that compounds 1 and 2 were biosynthesized de novo after incubation for three days with glucose (unpublished results). Consequently, a protocol of feeding glucose by pre-incubation of fresh leaves from P. crassinervium with a 10% aqueous solution was applied to enhance the expres- sion of the geranyltransferase activity. Subsequent to the enzymatic reaction, the synthesis of the ex- pected product was enhanced, being possible to identify it as the geranylic ester of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid 6 both in the crude extract and in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 5). This result is Fig. 3. Distribution of prenylated bioactive metabolites by genera within Pipera- ceae family.

(2007), we propose that it is the ester derivative instead of the ether, as reported. The expected chemical shift value for the CH2-10 at d observed in the 1H NMR, should be similar for the two derivatives 6 and 7 and, therefore this data should not be enough to distinguish which derivative was formed. Thus, further NMR experiments including analysis of the 13C NMR values and the gHMBC correlations were carried out. The observed differences in the substrate speciﬁcity, suggest the presence of, at least, two geranyltransferases in P. crassinervi- um. One of them was soluble and showed afﬁnity to the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid, while the second was concentrated in the microsomal fraction, recognizing the p-hydroxybenzoic acid as substrate and was inducible by glucose. The SDS PAGE and 2-DE analysis indicated the concentration of spots between pI 6–7 and 56–58 kDa in the microsomal fraction, which is in agreement with previous reports for geranyltransferases from plants (Fig. 6). The two enzymatically formed products were characterized as O-geranylated derivatives and were previously reported as syn- thetic compounds (Kubo et al., 2003). The production of esters in- stead of ethers or C-prenylated derivatives, as naturally occurs in plants, suggests that different conditions and environments could affect the prenylation outcome in crude and partly puriﬁed enzy- matic extracts. Besides, a C-geranylated derivative of the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid bearing a carbonyl group at C-50 could be proposed by the analysis of its MS–MS fragmentation data.

López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 observations are in agreement with previous reports based on bac- terial recombinant aromatic prenyltransferases (Haagena et al., 2007). In spite of the large number of data on phytochemistry and bio- activity on Piper species, no studies have been addressed to deter- mine their antiviral potential and the only exception involved the monotypic Pothomorphe umbellata (Fig. 3). The inhibition of viral proteases has indeed been demonstrated to be a good target to search new drugs for the treatment of several illnesses including AIDS. In this context, the investigation on some common proteases such as subtilisin and pepsin is considered as a useful screening for the discovery of potential inhibitors of retroviral proteases (Hirata et al., 2005). Compounds 3 and 6 were tested as inhibitors of sub- tilisin and pepsin using the ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology. Both compounds showed weak activity, being the ester 6 slightly more active than 3 showing 15% of inhibition at 1 lg/ml on pepsin and 14% on subtilisin (Table 3). Warfarin and dicoumarol were tested as positive controls. The HIV-like protease inhibitory potential reported for 3 and 6 is the ﬁrst approach to the determination of antiviral activity of this kind of compounds, and complements the range of biological activities previously reported, such as antifungal and antibacterial (Kubo et al., 2003; Nihei et al., 2004). 4. Conclusions Prenylation of aromatic compounds represents an important feature when the formation of bioactive compounds in plants is concerned. There are several examples in which different simple prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl, geranylgeranyl or polyterpenic unities are added to aromatic substrates rendering them with important biological properties. The literature survey indicated that among Piperaceae family, P. crassinervium species appeared as an impor- tant source of geranyltransferase activity looking at biotransforma- tions reactions. Between the two substrates evaluated, the p- hydroxybenzoic acid was O-geranylated, whilst the 3,4-dihydroxy- benzoic acid was both C- and O-geranylated. The O-geranylated products presented a weak protease inhibitory activity. The elec- trophoretic analysis performed on the microsomal fraction showed a typical prenyltransferase electrophoretic proﬁle (Mr 56–58 kDa, pI 6–7). This work contributes to the comprehensive study of biotrans- formation reactions with geranyl moieties using plant enzymatic extracts as an alternative strategy to the biocatalysis with puriﬁed enzymes.

Eleven acridone alkaloids were isolated from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. (Rutaceae), with eight of them being identiﬁed as potent and reversible inhibitors of cathepsin V (IC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 3.9 lM). Detailed mechanistic characterization of the effects of these compounds on the cathepsin V-cat- alyzed reaction showed clear competitive inhibition with respect to substrate, with dissociation con- stants (Ki) in the low micromolar range (2, Ki = 1.2 lM; 6, Ki = 1.0 lM; 7, Ki = 0.2 lM; and 11, Ki = 1.7 lM). Molecular modeling studies provided important insight into the structural basis for binding afﬁnity and enzyme inhibition. Experimental and computational approaches, including biological evalu- ation, mode of action assessment and modeling studies were successfully employed in the discovery of a small series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as competitive inhibitors of catV. The most potent inhibitor (7) has a Ki value of 200 nM. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Cathepsins, also known as lysosomal cysteine peptidases, are members of the papain-like peptidase family, which are implicated in many pathological conditions. These enzymes have been inten- sively studied as valuable targets for drug discovery and develop- ment.1,2 Although the major role of cathepsins is related to the terminal protein degradation in lysosomes, it has been shown that these enzymes are also involved in other relevant biochemical pathways, acting at selective and controlled processes with speciﬁc functions associated to their restricted tissue localization.3 In addi- tion, evidence has indicated that cysteine cathepsins have speciﬁc intra- and extracellular functions, being involved in a number of diseases including cancer, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, autoim- mune disorders, and viral infections.4 Cathepsin V (CatV, EC 3.4.22.43) was identiﬁed as a lysosomal cysteine protease speciﬁcally expressed in thymus, testis and cor- neal epithelium.5–7 The in vivo role of cathepsin V has been associ- ated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation pathway in humans8 and, in pathological conditions, the enzyme has been considered as a potential diagnostic marker for colon tumors.6 The enzyme is also expressed in colorectal and breast carcinomas but not in normal colon or mammary tissue. It is believed that cathepsin V plays a role in cancer progression, thus becoming a valuable drug target for oncology.9 Moreover, cathep- sin V has been identiﬁed as having potent elastolytic activity expressed in activated macrophages and, together with the lysosomal cathepsins L, K, and S, has been implicated in atheroscle- rosis.10,11 Signiﬁcant progress has been made to elucidate the rela- tionship between cysteine cathepsins and several pathological states. For instance, cathepsins K and S have been validated as drug targets for the treatment of osteoporosis and immune disorders, respectively.4 Natural products have provided considerable value to the phar- maceutical industry over the past century. Natural products repre- sent a rich source of structural diversity and biological activities, providing many drugs and lead compounds for the treatment of a variety of human diseases successfully developed for the treat of human diseases in many therapeutic areas.12 Several natural products have been investigated for their inhib- itory effects on the catalytic activity of cathepsins.4,13–15 Acridone alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring nitrogen heterocyclic compounds that have shown a large spectrum of biological activi- ties, including antiparasitic,16–18 antiviral,19 and cytotoxic.18,20–22 In the present work we described the biological evaluation and type of inhibition studies for a series of acridone alkaloids as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. Molecular modeling and preliminary structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies were also performed to investigate the molecular basis underlying the binding afﬁnity and inhibitory potency of this series of naturally occurring compounds.

Expression and puriﬁcation of cathepsin V Recombinant human cathepsin V was produced using the Pichia pastoris expression system as previously described.7 The molar concentration of the enzyme was determined by active site titra- tion with E-64 following the conditions previously described.23 2.3. Kinetic measurements All commercially available chemicals and reagents were pur- chased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma and used without fur- ther puriﬁcation. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and diluted to the appropriate concentration prior to the assays. The inhibitors were screened against cathepsin V at an initial concentration of 25 lM. The in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments were carried out in tripli- cate (in 96-well black plates) as previously described.24 The ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 200 lL, kept under stirring. Each well contained 191 lL of a 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM dithioerythritol (DTE), 2 lL of 1 mM Z-Phe-Arg-MCA dissolved in DMSO, 5 lL of sample, and 32 nM of cathepsin V. The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE at 27 C, and then the reaction mixture was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The reactions were started by the addition of the ﬂuorogenic substrate 4-methyl- coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) and measurements were conduct using the Molecular Devices Spectra MAX GEMINI XS (excitation 355 nm, and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irre- versible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). The IC50 values were independently determined by making rate measurements for at least ﬁve inhibitor concentrations. The type of inhibition and Ki values were determined under the same experimental conditions for three different inhibitor concentra- tions at ﬁve varying substrate concentrations (6.4, 9.6, 13, 19, and 38 lM). All kinetic parameters were determined from the collected data by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. The values represent means ± SD of at least three individual experiments. 2.4. Molecular modeling The X-ray crystallographic data for catV in complex with APC-3316 (an irreversible vinyl sulfone inhibitor) used in docking simulations were retrieved from PDB (PDB ID, 1FH0). For the calcu- lations, hydrogen atoms were added in standard geometry, using the Biopolymer module as implemented in the SYBYL 8.0 package (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux workstations. The only exception was the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys25), which was deprotonated during docking simulations. The histidine, glutamine, and asparagine residues in the active binding site were manually checked for possible ﬂipped orientation, protonation, and tautomeric states with the Pymol 0.99 (DeLano Scientiﬁc, San Carlos, CA) side-chain wizard script. The active site was deﬁned incorporating all amino acid residues within a radius sphere of 6.0 Å centered on the bound ligand. Molecular modeling studies were carried out using the default parameters of FlexX (BioSolveIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany).25 The FlexX scoring func- tion was employed to select the representative pose for each com- pound of this series. Subsequently, the top-ranked conformations for each compound were submitted to the web-based interface DrugScoreONLINE to rescore the proposed binding mode.26,27 Finally, the individual ranks obtained from the consensus scoring were considered to establish a new rank order list where the top-ranked inhibitor were selected for visual inspection. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Biochemical evaluation and preliminary SAR studies As part of our ongoing research program aimed at discovering natural products as new potent inhibitors of cathepsins K, V, L, and S, we have screened a collection of 270 compounds, from which 111 were natural products isolated from Brazilian plants. The major classes evaluated in this study included cumarins, triter- penes, cinnamic acids, amides, lignans, ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, and limonoids. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation: % inhibition ¼ 100 ð1 Vi=V0Þ where Vi and V0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determi- nate in presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively. Among the compounds tested, the most promising results against the cathepsins were obtained for the alkaloid and ﬂavonoid derivatives, including a series of acridone alkaloids (1–11), which showed potent inhibitory activity against cathepsin V. The chemi- cal structures and corresponding IC50 values (concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V) for the set of compounds (1–11) are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, com- pound 7 is the most potent inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 1.2 lM. This is a valuable result since acridone alkaloids as catV inhibitors have not been described in the literature. In addition to compound 7, compounds 1–3, 6, 10, and 11 also showed sub- stantial inhibition with IC50 values in the range of 2.2–5.2 lM. Compounds 4 and 5 showed only moderate inhibition, with IC50 values of 25 and 10 lM, respectively. The isomeric tetracyclic sys- tem (compounds 8 and 9) also showed low inhibitory potency, with IC50 values of 48 and 44 lM, respectively. The most potent inhibitors of the series (2, 4–7, 10, and 11) were then selected for further kinetic studies for determination of the type of inhibition and dissociation constants (Ki). 3.2. Mechanism of inhibition In order to explore the mechanism of inhibition in more detail, we have determined Ki values (Table 1) and the type of inhibition with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA employing com- pounds 2, 4–7, 10, and 11. The results indicate that the inhibition of catV was found to be competitive with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (Fig. 1). The Lineweaver–Burk double-reciprocal plots show intercepts of all lines (obtained at three different inhibitor concentrations) converging at the y-axis (1/Vmax), whereas the slope (KM/Vmax) and x-axis intercepts (1/KM) vary with inhibitor concentration. Consequently, the Vmax values remain constant, whereas the apparent values of KM (Kapp M , deﬁned as KM(1 + [I]/Ki)) increase with increasing inhibitor concentrations. This behavior is consistent with a mutually exclusive binding mode between inhibitor and substrate, therefore, these inhibitors (2, 4–7, 10, and 11) compete with Z-Phe-Arg-MCA for the free enzyme ac- tive site. Another factor that must be considered in inhibitor drug design is the comparisons on the rational basis of the enzyme dis- sociation constant (Ki), since IC50 values can vary with substrate concentration for competitive inhibitors. The same data of Figure 1 was employed to determine the Ki values of the competitive inhibitors using Dixon plots, which consist in plotting the recipro- cal of the initial velocity (1/V0) versus a series of inhibitor concentrations at constant substrate concentrations, where the R. P. Severino et al. / Bioorg. Med. Chem. 19 (2011) 1477–1481 1479 lines converge above the x-axis, indicating the inhibition constant Ki. The Ki values for inhibitors 2, 4–7, 10, and 11 are listed in Table 1. Accordingly, the results conﬁrm the acridone alkaloid derivatives as a new class of competitive inhibitors of catV, with afﬁnity values in the low micromolar range. 3.3. Molecular modeling studies The integration of experimental and computational approaches has become a vital component of structure- and ligand-based ap- proaches.28–31 Despite the strong evidence that the acridone alka- loids bind to the active site of the enzyme, the kinetic data does not provide insights into the binding proﬁle of the inhibitors (in the substrate pocket of catV). Therefore, molecular modeling studies were carried out to complement the kinetic ﬁndings and to inves- tigate the mode of interaction of these inhibitors.30,31 To achieve this, the compounds of this series were docked into the active site of catV. Although a quantitative agreement between the model and experimental SAR data was not expected, the model provided rel- evant insights into the inhibitory activity of the acridone alkaloid derivatives. The best predicted orientation of the representative inhibitor of this series, compound 7 (Ki = 200 nM), within the catV binding pocket is depicted in Figure 2. It can be seen that the inhib- itor binds to the central region of the catV substrate binding site, close to the catalytic residues Cys25 and His159. The inhibitor interacts to the enzyme through a set of four hydrogen bonds: (i) the 1-hydroxyl substituent is positioned at the S1 pocket as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly23; (ii) the oxygen atom of the 2-methoxy substituent accepts a hydrogen bond from the NH2 side-chain of Gln19, which is part of the oxyanion hole in catV;10 (iii) the 5-hydroxyl substituent binds to the S2 pocket acting as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Leu157; and (iv) the 9-carbonyl group binds to the S3 pocket by accepting a hydrogen bond from the NH main-chain of Gly66. In addition to the polar contacts, non-polar interactions contribute to the orientation of 7 in the catV binding site. The 1-hydroxyl and 2,3,4-trimethoxy substituted rings form van der Waals contacts with the side-chains of Phe67 and Cys25, respectively. These ﬁndings are in agreement with our SAR data, which indicated that the presence of polar substitu- ents at R1 (2-position) and less bulky groups at R4 (8-position) are favorable for enhanced inhibitory activity. Moreover, this confor- mation also suggests a structural feature that might be involved in the preferential binding of the 2-methoxy derivatives at R1 (7) compared with the corresponding isoprenoid (1–3) or unsubstitut- ed derivatives (4–6; 8–10). According to the model, the Gln19 res- idue would represent a hydrogen-bonding site to interact with the inhibitor in order to incorporate selected molecules inside the binding cavity of the enzyme, thereby contributing to the im- proved afﬁnity of the inhibitor 7. This observation is supported by the ﬁnding that the S10 would play a major role in the design of inhibitors having improved potency and afﬁnity.10 4. Conclusion In this work, we described a new series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as potent inhibitors of the enzyme catV. The kinetic and type of inhibition studies revealed that the compounds of this class are reversible competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme with afﬁnity in the low micromolar range. The SAR and molecular modeling investigations indicated important molecular and struc- tural features underlying the inhibitory activity of this series.

Subject and source In the course of our continuous search for bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi living in plants from Cerrado and Atlantic Forest (Cafeˆu et al., 2005; Teles et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005), healthy leaves of Cryptocarya mandioccana were submitted to isolation of endophytes and 15 strains were isolated. Among them Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz) Penz & Sacc., was selected for chemical and biological investigation because of the strong antifungal activity of the crude EtOAc extract against the phytopathogenic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium sphaerospermum. C. gloeosporioides was identiﬁed by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited in the fungal herbarium of the Univer- sidade Federal de Lavras (CML 737). 2.

Present study C. gloeosporioides was subcultured in Petri plates containing PDA and incubated for seven days. After this period, it was inoculated at 25e28 C in 20 500 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks, each containing 200 mL of Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB). The cultures were incubated at 25 C and aerated by agitation on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 28 days. The ﬁltered fermentation broth (ca. 4.0 L) was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 1.5 L); the organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and concentrated to yield 195.3 mg of crude extract. The crude extract was cleaned-up in reversed-phase silica gel (C-18) using MeOH as eluent and subsequently pu- riﬁed by reversed-phase preparation HPLC [C-18 column e Phenomenex-Luna (210 21.2 mm), l ¼ 254 nm, 10.0 mL/min, H2O:MeOH (75:25) to MeOH (100%) over 120 min], affording () cis-4-hydroxy-6-deoxyscytalone (1) [22.8 mg, tR ¼ 25 min, aD 25 133 (ca. 0.024, CHCl3)] and (4R)-4,8-dihydroxy-a-tetralone (2) [10.1 mg, tR ¼ 60 min, aD 25 17.7 (ca. 0.018, CHCl3)]. The chemical structure of these compounds was elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectral data and by comparison with those reported in the literature (Venkatasubbaiah and Chilton, 1992; Krohn et al., 2002; Aldridge et al., 1974; Kokubun et al., 2003; Machida et al., 2005). The antifungal activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Rahalison et al., 1991). The detection limit of these compounds required to inhibit growth of the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladospor- ioides and C. sphaerospermum was 5.0 mg, comparable with the positive control nystatin. OH O OH OH OH O OH 1 2 4. Ecological signiﬁcance The strong antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum of the compounds 1 and 2 suggests that the endophytic fungi C. gloeosporioides in C. mandioccana could protect the host by producing metabolites, which may be toxic or even lethal to phytopathogens, and highlights the potential of endo- phytic fungi in producing bioactive metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of C. gloeosporioides as an endophytic fungus inhabiting plants from Brazilian Atlantic Forest and C. mandioccana.

Introduction The Rutaceae family is constituted of about 150 genera with more than 1500 terrestrial species, being considered source of alkaloids, coumarins, ﬂavonoids and limonoids [1]. Hortia is a Neotropical genus of Rutaceae that comprises 12 species, dis- tributed in South America from Panama to the state of São Paulo, Brazil, most of them occurring in the Amazonian region. Xylella fastidiosa a Gram-negative bacterium is transmitted by xylem-feeding leafhoppers (Homoptera, Cicadellidae), and colo- nizes the xylem of plants causing diseases on several economically important crops such as citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) in sweet orange, Pierce’s disease (PD) of grapevine and coffee leaf scorch (CLS) [2]. The generally accepted cause of the symptoms induced by X. fastidiosa is the occurrence of vascular occlusion inside the ves- sel leading to water stress. It was previously demonstrated that the bacterium is able to grow as a bioﬁlm, which could be an important factor for pathogenicity [2]. As part of our efforts to ﬁnd potential lead compounds as bactericidal against this economically impor- tant phytopathogenic bacterium, coumarins, ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivative, anacardic acid, triterpenes and limonoids isolated from Rutaceae, Meliaceae and Anacardiaceae plants were assayed against X. fastidiosa [2]. Triterpene deriva- tives were the most active, guyanin (1), odoratone, gedunin, and ∗Corresponding author. E-mail address: dmfs@power.ufscar.br (M.F.d.G.F. da Silva). azadiractin A showed MIC of 2.9, 2.3, 2.7, and >2.2 × 103 M, respectively. Rutaecarpin (2) and 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid also showed appreciable activity against X. fastidiosa, the MICs were 4.2 and 4.8 × 103 M, respec- tively [2]. Compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) were isolated from H. oreadica taproots [3,4]. The need for novel and more selective agents to treat proto- zoal diseases remains. The classic examples of these diseases are Chagas, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and malaria. African try- panosomiasis or sleeping sickness is caused by T. brucei rhodesiense (East to South Africa) and T. brucei gambiense (West and Central Africa). They affect about half a million people in sub-Saharan Africa and an estimated 60 million people are at risk of contracting dis- ease, which is fatal if untreated [5]. The chemotherapy of these diseases is inadequate due to problems of drugs resistance, vari- able efﬁcacy between strain or species of the causative organisms, toxicity, difﬁcult of administration or requirement of long course of administration [6]. Human malaria is responsible for consid- erable morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is caused by four species P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum. Of these four species P. falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of the 300–500 million episodes of malaria worldwide and accounts for 0.7–2.7 million annual deaths. In many endemic countries, malaria is responsible for economic stagnation, lowering the annual eco- nomic growth in some regions by up to 1.5% [7]. These factors increase the urgency of the search for novel agents to treat protozoal diseases. Highly oxygenated ﬂavones and dibenzoylmethanes have shown to be active in tested for in vitro activity against P. falciparum 0021-9673/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical structures of compounds from H. oreadica. and T. brucei rhodesiense [8]. These promising results have stimu- lated us to test some 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid derivatives for activity against these parasites. Preliminary assay was performed on methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), which showed activity against both P. falciparum and T. brucei rhodesienses. However, compound 3 has been isolated from Hortia oreadica taproots in small amount, and then the MICs were not determined. Compounds 1–3 (Fig. 1) were isolated from H. oreadica taproots [3,4]. Furthermore, if it is assumed that it is possible to modify the chemical structure of compounds in order to improve activ- ity and selectivity on the above assays, phytochemical studies of other organs of H. oreadica deserve more attention. Thus, we have now examined the leaves of H. oreadica since they have never been investigated before. The leaves afforded the known limonoid guyanin (1), the alkaloids rutaecarpin (2) and dictamnine (6), the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4), together with the new E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4- carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) (Fig. 1). Generally, the conventional methods including silica gel, polyamide and reversed-phase liquid chromatography are often used to isolate pure products from H. oreadica, but they are tedious, time consuming and usually require multiple chromato- graphic steps [9–11]. Counter-current chromatography (CCC), a liquid–liquid partition chromatography method, has a track record of being a powerful tool in the preliminary stages of crude extract fractionation [12–15]. With the ability to attain high res- olution, modern CCC and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) instrumentation, such as HSCCC and fast-centrifugal parti- tion chromatography (FCPC), have signiﬁcant potential to develop new approaches in natural product drug discovery, speciﬁcally towards reducing the expensive and time-consuming steps to iso- late active constituents. Due to the lack of a solid stationary phase, CCC has no irreversible adsorption and, therefore, provides loss-less fractionation [16]. Since samples are simply partitioned between different solvents phases, there is 100% theoretical sample recov- ery. In crude plant extract fractionation this is particularly valuable because it minimizes the chances of losing the activity during frac- tionation. This beneﬁt of CCC allows researchers to address the issues of synergy between compounds to explain biological activ- ity in plants, without the need to address potential irreversible adsorption of active constituents to the solid stationary phase dur- ing fractionation [14,17]. Therefore, HSCCC was used for separation and puriﬁcation of compounds 1–6 from dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oreadica. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus The HSCCC instrument employed in the present study was man- ufactured by P.C. Inc., Potomac, MD 20854, USA. It contained a quadruple multilayer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The ˇ value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (ˇ = r/R, where r is the dis- tance from the coil to the holder, and R, the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis and the central shaft). The sample injection loop volume was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus was regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The ﬂow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, NY, USA) constant-ﬂow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector (Eyela, DC-1200); Liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spec- trometry (LC–APCI-MS/MS) data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography equipped with a PDA2996 photodi- ode array detection (DAD) system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaﬂow electro- spray probe; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): on a Bruker DRX 400 and 100 MHz with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal stan- dard; infrared (IR): Bomen-FT-IR; ultraviolet (UV): Varian 500 Scan UV–Vis (visible)-NIR (near infrared); gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS): low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument. For low-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (APCI-MS), a Micromass Quattro LC instrument was used, equipped with a “Z- spray” ion source. 2.2. Reagents All organic solvents used for HSCCC were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and for LC–APCI- MS/MS were HPLC grade purchased from J.T. Baker (Ecatepec, Mexico). Water puriﬁed (18 M<OMEGA>) by areverseosmosisMilli- V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 4277 Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for all solutions and dilutions. 2.3. Plant material The leaves of H. oreadica were collected in January 2001 in Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. The identiﬁcation was carried out by Dr. José Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, São Paulo University and vouchers are deposited in the Herbarium of the same department. 2.4. Preparation of crude sample The leaves (3.2 kg) of H. oreadica were dried carefully by forced air at 40 ◦C and reduced to powder. The powdered dried leaves were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH at room temperature three times. After the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (93.0 g), dichloromethane (161.0 g) and methanol (42.0 g). 2.5. Selection of two-phase solvent system Small amounts of dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. ore- adica were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the compounds allowed to partition between the two phases [18,19]. The distribution of the components between both phases of each the 5 solvents systems were analyzed by thin-layer chromatogra- phy (TLC) using 20 cm × 20 cm silica gel plates with a thickness of 0.20 mm (silica gel 60 F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), on which the crude extract was horizontally spotted. The solvent system used for the development of the TLC plates was hexane–ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v). The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with a solution of vanillin reagent (5 g of vanillin in 9 mL of methanol, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 and 3 drops of acetic acid) followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of compounds into each phase. The partition coefﬁcients were determined by GC–MS only for the best solvent system as follows: 0.5 mg of dichloromethane extract was added to a test tube, to which 5 mL of each phase of the two-phase solvent system was added. The test tube was shaken as above, and then the upper and lower phases were analyzed by GC–MS. The parti- tion coefﬁcients of three compounds in sample were determined according to the peak areas. 2.6. Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution The two-phase solvent system composed of hexane–ethanol– acetonitrile–water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separatory funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The upper phase and the lower phase were separated and degassed by sonication for 20 min shortly before use. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving the dichlorom- ethane extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v). 2.7. GC–MS analysis The partition coefﬁcient and HSCCC fractions were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph ﬁtted with a fused silica DB-5 (30 m × 0.32 mm I.D., 0.25 m ﬁlm thickness) capillary column with helium as the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The temperature was programmed initially at 100 ◦C for 1 min, and then increased with a rate of 10 ◦C min−1 to 250 ◦C, the latter main- tained for 30 min. The injection (1 L) was split and its temperature was 280 ◦C. The interface temperature was 250 ◦C. The chromato- graph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass-selective detector at 70 eV. 2.8. HSCCC separation The upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elution mode. First, the coiled column was entirely ﬁlled with the station- ary phase (lower phase). Then the apparatus was rotated forward at 800 rpm, while the mobile phase (upper phase) was pumped into the column in a tail to head direction at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min−1. The retention of stationary phase (SF) was 85% (SF = 0.85). After the mobile phase front emerged and the hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution con- taining 2.5 g of the dichloromethane extract was injected through the injection module at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min−1. A total of 34 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an automated fraction collector. However, with 24 fractions all compounds obtained have already eluted. 2.9. TLC analysis of fractions obtained by HSCCC All HSCCC fractions collected were monitored by TLC (20 cm × 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254) with hexane–ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v) as the developing solvent. Based on the TLC plates monitoring, all HSCCC fractions were combined into 8 analytically distinct fractions. Fractions 1–2 afforded 5,8- dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4, 0.240 g), fraction 3 furnished E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4- carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5, 0.045 g) and fraction 5 yielded methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6- propanoate (3), (0.148 g). Fraction 4 was ﬂash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with n-hexane–Me2CO (8:2) affording guyanin (1, 0.04 g). Fraction 6 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2–MeOH, 6:4) to give rutaecarpin (2, 0.11 g). Fractions 7–8 were puriﬁed as fraction 6 to yield dictamnine (6, 0.088 g). 2.10. LC–APCI-MS/MS LC–APCI-MS/MS data were acquired using a 3.0 mm × 30 mm, 3.5 m XTerra-MS C-18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively, each one supplemented with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid, TFA): 20% line B at the beginning then goes to 30% B and 30% C in 9 min; the column was then washed with 20% line B and 80% line C for 4 min and re-conditioned with 20% line B for 3 min; a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210–500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post UV-detector splitter was used to send only 0.3 mL min−1 to the ion source; nitrogen was used for nebulization (200 L h−1) and desolvation (785 L h−1); the corona discharge was set at 3.27 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 27 and 4 V respectively; argon (Ar) was used for the fragmentation experiments and the parent ions were accelerated using a collision energy ramp of 1–25 eV. For SRM experiments, the cone voltage was maintained using tune parameters previ- ously optimized for all compounds at 27 V, and two transitions were selected for each compound (Fig. 2): for 1, m/z 499 →397 (monitoring) and m/z 499 →343 (quantiﬁcation), using a collision energy (CE) of 20 eV; for compound 2, m/z 288 →244 (quantiﬁca- tion) and m/z 288 →169 (monitoring) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 3 m/z 307 →203 (monitoring) and m/z 307 →233 (quantiﬁcation) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 4 m/z 293 →201 (monitoring) and m/z 293 →233 (quantiﬁcation) (CE = 25 eV); for compound 5 m/z 4278 V.G.P.

The dwell time was 0.08 s, and the interscan delay was 0.1 s. The col- lision gas pressure (argon) was set at 1.35e−3 mbar for all experiments. 2.10.1. Software All MS data were acquired and processed using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, UK). 2.10.2. Calibration standard and analytical curves Stock solutions (1000 g mL−1) of compounds 1–6 were pre- pared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, HPLC grade, Ecatepec, Mexico). Working solutions were prepared at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 g mL−1 by diluting stock solutions. Calibration standards curves were obtained in triplicates. For each point of the analyt- ical curves, the worst value in comparison with the average was discarded. Calibration curves were obtained plotting concentration (g mL−1) in axis x per area below SRM peaks (arbitrary units) in axis y (average of three runs). 2.10.3. Sample preparation The dichloromethane extract (30 mg) was re-suspended in 3.0 mL of HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) in cen- trifuge tubes by vortex agitation (Phoenix AP56, Araraquara, SP Brazil) for 30 s at the maximum possible speed. The obtained solu- tion was ﬁltered (PTFE Millipore, São Paulo, Brazil, d. 25.0 mm and p. 0.20 m), and then diluted appropriately and used for quantiﬁ- cation of compounds 1–6 by LC–APCI-MS/MS. 2.11. Biological assays Stock solutions of the compounds, plus control drugs, were prepared at a concentration of 20 g mL−1 in dimethyl sulfox- ide (DMSO; Sigma, UK), and diluted to appropriate concentration prior to assays. IC50 values were calculated with MSXLFIT (IDBS, UK). 2.11.1. P. falciparum Chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 was maintained in human A+ erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, UK) sup- plemented with Albumax II at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. P. falciparum intraerythrocytic cultures were set up as above, with 1% ring stage parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit, in triplicate in 100 L of medium in 96 well, ﬂat-bottomed Microtest III tissue plates. Drugs were added in threefold dilution series and cultures incubated for a total of 48 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. After 24 h, {3H} hypoxanthine (0.2 mCi) was added to each well. At the end of the assay, plates were rapidly freezethawed, harvested using a Tomtec Mach III cell harvested (Tomtec, CT) onto a 96-well format ﬁltermat and Meltilex solid scintillant (both Wallac, Finland) added prior to reading in a Microbeta 1450 scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland) at 1 min per well. 2.11.2. T. brucei rhodesiense T. brucei rhodesiense STIB900 blood stream form trypomastigotes were maintained in HMI-18 medium, with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HarlanSeraLab, UK) at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2–air mixture. Prior to drugging, trypomastigotes were washed and re-suspended in fresh medium at a concentration 2 × 105 mL−1, and 100 L of this suspension was added to the drug dilutions. The top concentration for the test compounds was 30 g mL−1. Pentamidine was included as the standard drug. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4–5 h on Gemini ﬂuorescent plate reader (Soﬁmax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a ﬁlter cut-off at 550 nm. 2.11.3. Cytotoxicity assays 96-well plates were seeded with KB cells at a concentration of 2 × 104 mL−1 (100 L per well). Drugs at 300, 30, 3 and 0.3 g mL−1 were added in fresh overlay after 24 h, in triplicate at each con- centration. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2–air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates. Plates were read after 4–5 h on Gemini ﬂuorescent plate reader (Soﬁmax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a ﬁlter cut-off at 550 nm.

Results and discussion 3.1. LC–APCI-MS/MS In an attempt to establish a suitable method for quantiﬁcation of compounds in dichloromethane extract from leaves of H. oread- ica, this was analyzed by HPLC–APCI-MS/MS using the SRM mode. The content of compounds in the crude extracts is important to determine their recovery in HSCCC analyses. The mobile phase was determined after testing different compositions of solvents. A good chromatographic resolution was achieved using a 9 min gradient, beginning with 20% acetonitrile then going to 30% acetonitrile and 30% methanol. This mobile phase provided both excellent separa- tion between all six compounds and good ionization levels under the APCI ion source. The SRM transitions were chosen on the basis of the stability of product ions obtained under collision-induced dis- sociation (CID)-MS/MS. The second-generation product ion spectra of compounds 1–6 showed intense protonated molecules ([M + H+]) at m/z 499, 288, 307, 293, 313 (m/z 313 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the protonated molecular ion m/z 359), and 200 respec- tively.

Regression analysis of the least-square line for data acquired from the external stan- dard calibration curves showed good linearity at a 0.01–1.0 g mL−1 concentration range of six compounds, with a correlation coef- ﬁcient above 0.997 for all curves. The content of guyanin (1), rutaecarpin (2), methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1- benzopyran-6-propanoate (3), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1- benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (4), E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy- 4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5), and dictamnine (6) in the crude extract were 2.42%, 4.80%, 5.78%, 9.82%, 1.80%, 4.15%, respectively, and showed RSD ranging from 0.03 to 2.11%, as deter- mined by HPLC–APCI-MS/MS (Table 1). 3.2. CCC solvent system The essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvents. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. However, this is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent. For efﬁcient separation, it is important that the partition coefﬁcient (K) of the target compounds should lie in the range 0.5 < K < 2.0, and the separation factor between any two components (˛ = k2/k1, k2 > k1) should be greater than 1.5. A smaller K value results in a loss of peak resolution, while a larger value produces excessive band broaden- ing. To ensure a satisfactory retention of the stationary phase, the settling time of the solvent system should be shorter than 30 s. In order to avoid wastage of solvent, it is recommended that the two-phase system under consideration produces similar volumes of each phase [20]. It is also essential to consult solvent systems used in countercurrent chromatography that can be found in the specialised literature, e.g. [18,21–23]. Various techniques can be used for analysis of the best solvent system. Thin-layer chromatography is a very rapid way of guiding method development. A small amount of the sample is thoroughly mixed in a vial with equal volumes of the upper and lower phases of the chosen solvent system. The same volume of each phase is applied to a TLC plate which is then allowed to migrate in the 4280 V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 Fig. 4. Mass spectra of compounds 3 (A), 4 (B) and 5 (C), (GC–MS, 70 eV). organic phase of the two-phase solvent system. An optimal sys- tem gives an equal distribution between the two phases and Rf values of the sample components between 0.2 and 0.5. If the sam- ple is found almost exclusively in one phase, the solvent system is obviously of no use. It should be noted that the Rf value gives only an approximate indication of the appropriateness of a par- ticular solvent because TLC involves both partition and adsorption mechanisms, whereas CCC is based on purely liquid–liquid partition phenomena [20]. The following polar two-phase solvent systems were tested: chloroform–methanol–water (5:4:3, v/v), dichloromethane–meth- anol–water (4:5:3, v/v), hexane–ethanol–acetonitrile–water (10:8: 1:1, v/v), hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (3:7:5:5, v/v), hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (1:1:1:1, v/v), hexane– ethyl acetate–methanol–water (5:5:4:5, v/v), hexane–ethanol– methanol–water(10:7:10:8,v/v),hexane–ethanol–methanol–water (10:10:9:11, v/v), and hexane–chloroform–methanol–water (3:6:3:2, v/v). Out of the 9 candidate biphasic solvent systems, 4 were rejected, as the settling times were either too long, emulsions were formed when extract was added, or suitable partitioning did not occur. The remaining 5 solvent systems gave reasonable sepa- ration on TLC, however, only hexane–ethanol–acetonitrile–water (10:8:1:1, v/v) showed similar distribution among the two phases with the Rf values approximately 0.3 between the components, and therefore it was used for the CCC separation. The partition coefﬁcients determined by GC–MS with this solvent system for compounds 3–5 obtained in one-step separation were 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1, respectively. 5,8-Dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran- 6-propanoic acid (4) was obtained in a pure form at tubes 1–11, E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) at tubes 12–14, and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3) at tubes 20–22. The GC–MS of these compounds was shown in Fig. 4. The recovery of com- pounds 3–5 of 2.5 g of crude extract in a one-step separation were 102.5%, 101.2%, 99.0% (Table 1), respectively, which were determined by comparison with HPLC–APCI-MS/MS data. Guyanin (1) was obtained after column chromatography on silica gel, rutae- carpin (2) and dictamnine (6) on Sephadex LH-20, however, their recoveries were also excellent 66.2%, 93.1% and 84.9% (Table 1), respectively. 3.3. The structural Identiﬁcation of the compounds The structures of isolated compounds were identiﬁed on the basis of spectral data, particularly 1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, and APCI-MS/MS, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spec- trum with those from the literature. Compounds 1 and 2 have previously been isolated from Hortia regia [24], 3 and 4 from H. colombiana [25] and dictamnine (6) from H. longifolia [26] (Fig. 1). The new compound E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbo methoxyphenyl) cinnamic acid was identiﬁed as 5 (Fig. 1) on the basis of the following data: Amorphous white solid. UV max/nm (CHCl3) 215, 200, 204; IR max/cm−1 (liq. ﬁlm) 3019, 2927, 2854 (CH), 1734 (carboxyl group,) 1738 (ester), 1626, 1518, 1464, 1441, 1379, 1262, 1215, 756, 669. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 7.22 (1H, d, H-2, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.93 (1H, brd, H-5, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.06 (1H, dd, H-6, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz), 6.87 (1H, d, H-2′, J = 2.0 Hz), 8.22 (1H, d, H-5′, J = 8.4 Hz), 6.99 (1H, dd, H-6′, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz), 3.93 (3H, s, COOCH3), 3.92 (3H, s, 3-OCH3), 3.93 (3H, s, 4-OCH3), 7.95 (1H, s, H-). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): 124.7 (C-1), 112.6 (C- 2), 149.2 (C-3), 148.9 (C-4), 111.3 (C-5), 121.3 (C-6), 118.5 (C-1′), 100.1 (C-2′), 134.3 (C-3′), 135.0 (C-4′), 127.8 (C-5′), 114.6 (C-6′), 176.0 (COOH), 164.1 (COOCH3), 56.0 (COOCH3), 55.8 (3-OCH3), 55.8 (4-OCH3), 152.2 (C-), 158.0 (C-). HMBC (400 MHz, CDCl3): H- →C-1, C-, COOH; H-2 →C-3, C-6; H-5 →C-1, C-4; H-6 →C- 2, C-4; H-2′ →C-, C-1′; H-5′ →C-, C-1′, COOMe; H-6′ →C-1′; 3-OMe →C-3; 4-OMe →C-4; 4′-COOMe →COOMe.GC–MS low res- olution (Fig. 4): 70 eV: m/z (rel. int. %): 312 (100), 297 (31), 269 (15), 226 (10), 141 (15), 127 (13), 119 (23), 91 (15). The ion at m/z 312 was a loss of CH2O2 moiety from the molecular ion. It is the ﬁrst report of this compound in litera- ture. 3.4. Effect of isolated compounds on P. falciparum, T. brucei rhodesienses and KB cells Compound 3 was assayed again and showed IC50 of 23.6 M against P. falciparum and IC50 of 15.6 M against T. brucei rhodesienses. An assay with KB cells has been also devel- oped in order to compare in vitro toxicity of dihydrocinnamic V.G.P. Severino et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4275–4281 4281 acid with the selective action on the parasites, and 3 was not toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 M). The 2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acids represent a novel class of compounds tested for the ﬁrst time as antimalarial and try- panocidal agents. Unfortunately, the other compounds showed no appreciable activity against P. falciparum and T. brucei rhode- sienses (IC50 > 100 M). Activity appears to be associated with a methyl ester function, since E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy- 4-carbomethoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid 5 and 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid 4 were inactive against both protozoan. Thus, in order to ﬁnd potential lead com- pounds, derivatives 4 and 5 will be converted in methyl ester and assayed again. 4. Conclusion Compounds 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6- propanoic acid (4), E-3,4-dimethoxy-(3-hydroxy-4-carbomet hoxyphenyl)cinnamic acid (5) and methyl 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2- dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (3) were obtained in one-step HSCCC separation. The one-step separation was more rapid (1 h and 20 min) and less solvents consuming, while conven- tional methods of CC for separation of guyanin (1), rutaecarpin (2) and dictamnine (6) from HSCCC fraction 4, 6 and 7–8 (respectively) were rather time consuming. Fraction 4 was ﬂash chromatographed on silica gel and compound 1 was obtained with more work- ing time (12 h). Fractions 6 and 7–8 were applied to Sephadex LH-20 ant took less working time (4 h). The present LC–APCI- MS/MS method was successfully applied to the quantiﬁcation of all six compounds from the crude extracts, and permit- ted to determine the recovery of compounds 1–6 in HSCCC analyses, which were excellent. The present study proved that HSCCC is a powerful technique for the isolation in one-step of compounds 3–5 from plant crude extracts for bioactivity stud- ies. The biological result indicated that the compound tested was active at concentrations in the micromolar range, while the con- trols chloroquine (IC50 3.0 nM, P. falciparum) and pentamidine (IC50 35 nM, T. brucei) were active in the nanomolar range under the same test conditions. However, if it is assumed that the IC50 required for continued investigation is <30 M, the IC50 of compound 3 is meaningful. Chemical transformation of the limonoid guyanin (1, 40 mg) and alkaloid rutaecarpin (2, 110 mg) is in progress and perhaps could improve their antibacterial activity against X. fastidiosa.

Introduction Coumarins constitute an important class of natural compounds with widespread distribution and exhibit a wide range of activity. Every year a large number of coumarins, having varied substitution patterns, are isolated from nature [1]. Xanthyletin (1, Fig. 1) is a coumarin isolated from Citrus species. Several biological activities, such as anti-tumor and anti-bacterial activities and inhibition of the symbiotic fungus cultivated by leaf-cutting ants [2–4] have been associated with this compound. Leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores in the tropics, can be found from the Southern USA to Northern Argentina [5]. Leaf- cutting ants are known to be a serious pest for agriculture due to the high amounts of vegetal matter from crops used by them in order to cultivate a symbiotic fungus on which they rely for food and enzymes [6,7]. The mutualism between the fungus and the ants is a point to be explored when alternative methods of con- trol are being thought of. Several compounds have been used for the control of these ants as organophosphorus, pyrethroids and sulﬂuramid insecticides [3]. Consequently, an extensive search for alternate methods to control these insects has been made in an attempt to substitute traditional agrochemicals by high speciﬁcity and, therefore, causing less damage to the environment. ∗Corresponding author.

The preparative isolation and puriﬁcation of xanthyletin from plant materials by conventional methods such as column chro- matography has been reported previously [4]. But the method is tedious and requires multiple chromatography steps. The counter- current chromatography technique has been widely used today in the isolation of natural products, and it is a form of liquid–liquid par- tition without the use of adsorbents, using two or more immiscible liquids, which are the mobile phase and the other the stationary phase. It eliminates irreversible absorptive loss of samples onto the solid support matrix used in conventional chromatography. The technique allows complete recovery of the sample, and is suitable for separations in the gram range [8]. This study reports the isolation of xanthyletin using high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) for the ﬁrst time. The optimum conditions were obtained for xanthyletin isolation with the purity at over 99%. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus The HSCCC system employed in the present study was a P.C. Inc. (Potomac, MD, USA) instrument equipped with a quadruple multi- layer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and total capacity of 443 mL. The ˇ value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (ˇ = r/R, where r is the distance from the coil to the holder, and R, the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis 0021-9673/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Structures of coumarins isolated from crude extract of the Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limonia roots: xanthyletin (1), suberosin (2), seselin (3) and xan- thoxyletin (4). and the central shaft). The loop volume of the sample injection was 5 mL. The revolution speed of the apparatus can be regulated with a speed controller in the range between 0 and 1000 rpm. The ﬂow rate was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering, New York, USA) constant-ﬂow pump. The fractions were obtained with an automated fraction collector DC-1200 (Eyela, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Gas chromatography and mass spectra (GC–MS) were per- formed in a Shimadzu GC-17A (Tokyo, Japan) instrument coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 (EIMS) system. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were performed using two Shimadzu pumps (LC-10AD and LC-10 Advp) and an SPD-M10Avp UV detector set at 205 nm. HPLC-grade sol- vents were obtained from Mallinckrodt, and H2O was puriﬁed in a Milli-Q system. LC-UV-electrospray ionization (ESI) MS/MS data were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatog- raphy equipped with a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) PDA2996 photodiode array detection (DAD) system; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaﬂow electrospray probe. For NMR, Bruker (Rheinstetten, Germany) DRX 400 and ARX 200 instruments were used; for UV a Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) 500 Scan UV–vis–near infrared (NIR) system and for IR a Bomen-FT/IR (Quebec, Canada) instrument. 2.2. Reagents and plant materials All the solvents used for preparation of crude sample and HSCCC separation were of analytical grade (Quimis) and the water used was distilled water. The root of Citrus sinensis grafted on Citrus limonia were collected in Estac¸ ão Experimental de Cit- ricultura do Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, Cordeirópolis, Brazil. 2.3. Preparation of crude extract The roots (467 g) of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia were dried carefully by forced air at 40 ◦C and reduced to powder. The pow- dered dried root was extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH at room temperature for 3 times. After the evapora- tion of the solvents under reduced pressure, crude extracts were obtained: hexane (5.7 g), dichloromethane (7.6 g) and methanol (17.6 g). 2.4. Selection of two-phase solvent system Small amounts of crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia were dissolved in separate test tubes containing the solvent systems to be tested. The test tubes were vigorously shaken and the com- pounds allowed to partition between the two phases [9,10]. In order to determine partition coefﬁcient value K′ of approximately 1, the distribution of the components between both phases of 11 solvents system tested was determined by silica gel thin-layer chromatog- raphy (TLC) (20 cm × 20 cm, 0.2 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254nm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as the eluting solvent. The compounds were visualized under a UV lamp at 254 and 365 nm and developed by spraying with solution acid of vanillin followed by heating to assist visual estimation of relative distribution of the xanthyletin. 2.5. Choice of the mobile phase In the choice of the mobile phase, small amounts of crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia were applied on silica gel TLC and it was developed with the water-saturated organic layer (i.e., upper organic phase) as the eluting solvent. 2.6. Preparation of two-phase solvent system and sample solution The two-phase solvent system composed of hex- ane/ethanol/acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) was used for HSCCC separation. Each solvent was added to a separator funnel and thoroughly equilibrated at room temperature. The two phases were separated and degassed by sonication prior to use. The sample solution was prepared by dissolving the crude extract in a mixture of upper and lower phase (1:1, v/v) of the solvent system used for HSCCC separation. 2.7. HSCCC separation The upper phase was used as the mobile phase and the lower phase was used as the stationary phase in the tail-to-head elu- tion mode. In each separation, the multilayer-coiled column was ﬁrst ﬁlled entirely with the stationary phase. The mobile phase was then pumped into the tail end of the inlet column at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL/min, while the apparatus was rotated at 850 rpm. After the mobile phase front emerged and hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution containing 1.2 g of the crude extract was injected. 2.8. HPLC analysis and identiﬁcation of HSCCC peak fractions The crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia and each peak fraction from HSCCC separation were analyzed by HPLC. Anal- ysis of coumarins in the crude sample and each peak fraction from HSCCC was performed on a C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm I.D., 5 m); ﬂow rate 0.8 mL/min; detection wavelength, 220 and 270 nm. The mobile phase composed of MeOH:H2O (6:4) was eluted at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min and the efﬂuent was monitored at 220 and 270 nm. The retention time was compared with that of standard of each coumarin. LC-UV-ESI-MS/MS data were obtained using a 250 mm × 4.60 mm, 5 m Luna Phenyl-Hexyl column (Phe- nomenex, CA, USA); the gradient elution system consisted of the following steps (H2O, acetonitrile and methanol in lines A, B and C respectively): 40% line B at the beginning then goes to 50% B and 20% C in 10 min and stay so for 17 min; the column was then washed with 100% line C for 2 min and re-conditioned with 35 line B for 8 min; a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min was used for the analysis and the compounds were detected at 210–500 nm; mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode; a post column splitter was used to C.d.M.

Analyses GC–MS GC–MS was performed in a 30 m × 0.2 mm DB-5 capillary col- umn. The mass spectrometer was set to scan 40–650 m/z with an ionizing voltage at 70 eV. Samples were injected (1 L) with a split- ting ratio of 1:20 and the injector temperature was set to 250 ◦C. A continuous ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min of chromatographic grade helium was used. The column oven was initially at 120 ◦C and was held for 1 min after injection, followed by temperature ramping at 10 ◦C/min up to 250 ◦C, hold for 10 min. The total run time was approximately 24 min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Optimization of HSCCC conditions, choice of CCC solvent systems and mobile phase The essence of a successful CCC separation is the correct choice of chromatography solvent. One of the advantages of the technique is that if a solvent is not suitable and separation is not achieved, the sample can be quantitatively recovered. Hence, it is time consuming and it is preferable to start with the right solvent [9,11–15]. Several techniques can be used to obtain the best solvent system and TLC is a very rapid way of guiding method development. The polar two-phase solvent systems tested for HSCCC obtain- ing xanthyletin are presented in Table 1. Among those the hexane/ethanol/acetonitrile/water (10:8:1:1, v/v) gave the best partition coefﬁcient value, as well as it presented no emulsion for- mation and the time for phase separation was short (Table 1) for crude extract and pure xanthyletin and therefore was used for the HSCCC separation. The choice of the mobile phase has been done by TLC. The rapid TLC method to choice of two-phase aqueous sol- vent systems is the most applicable to the separations of a given extract [12]. If the RF values of the compounds to be separated are higher than about 0.5 (less polar solutes (RF < 0.5) the more polar layer should be used as the mobile phase. However, the organic phase was used as mobile phase because RF values of the com- pounds to be separated are higher than about 0.5 and it facilitates the evaporation of solvent from the collected fractions. Several additional CCC optimization parameters were examined, i.e., number of columns, ﬂow rates, volume of fractions collected, sample volume and mass injected and rotation speed. The num- ber of columns had inﬂuenced on the separation and purity of the outcome sample. When the separation was conducted for four coumarins employing 2 and 3 columns, poor separation occurred. On the other hand, when 4 columns were used, good separation results and acceptable separation time could be obtained. Besides the recovered sample had higher purity for each coumarin studied. The best ﬂow tested was 3 mL/min and 800 rpm. 3.2. Isolation of xanthyletin, suberosin, seselin and xanthoxyletin A total of 100 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an auto- mated fraction collector. The collected fractions were monitored by TLC. The fractions 36-41, 47-53, 55-63, 71-94 contained, suberosin 2, 30.8 mg, 93% purity), seselin (3, 17 mg, 86.9% purity), xan- thoxyletin (4, 36,4 mg, 89.5% purity), and xanthyletin (1, 128.5 mg, 90% purity) respectively. The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. The difference between suberosin and the other coumarins is the existence of a dimethylallyl group in the molecule. This group confers lower polarity to the suberosin when compared with the other coumarins under study. As such, this compound is the ﬁrst to be eluted in HSCCC analysis. The dimethylallyl group bonded to coumarin skeleton is able to cyclize with the phenol group, like the other coumarins, rendering them more planarity and with high interaction with aqueous phase. The structural difference between the seselin, xanthoxyletin and the xanthyletin is the presence of a methoxy group in the 5 position in xanthoxyletin of the angu- lar or linear pyrane ring in seselin and xanthyletin, respectively. The lipophilicity of seselin and xanthoxyletin when compared with xanthyletin can be justiﬁed by the presence of the methoxy group and angular ring. These differences in lipophilicity are responsible for the observed compounds’ elution. 3.3. HPLC and GC–MS analyses and identiﬁcation of the coumarins in HSCCC fractions Following preparative isolation and puriﬁcation by HSCCC, the collected fractions were analyzed by TLC, GC–MS and HPLC–MS to determine the relative purities of each fraction. Fig. 2 presents HPLC chromatograms of crude extract of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia and of xanthyletin, seselin and xanthoxyletin. Fig. 3A and B presents the mass and UV spectra of these compounds. Xan- thyletin was obtained with over 99% of purity after crystallization and 15.45 min retention time. The GC chromatography conﬁrms this purity. Seselin and xanthoxyletin were obtained in 70% and 57%, respectively and their retention times were 15.9 and 16.6 min, respectively (Fig. 2). Suberosin was analyzed ﬁrst by GC–MS and presented the purity of 93% (Fig. 4), but in the HPLC analysis (Fig. 5) it undergoes oxidation to a coumarin with 260 dalton. Further stud- ies have to be done to determine the structure, mechanism and reason for this transformation to occur. 4310 C.d.M. Cazal et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 4307–4312 Fig. 2.

Conclusion The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that HSCCC is a powerful technique for the isolation of xanthyletin, an inhibitor of leaf-cutting ant (Atta sexdens rubropilosa) symbiotic fungus (Leucoagaricus gongylophorus), as well as suberosin and xan- thoxyletin from root crude extract of graft of C. sinensis on C. limonia. High-speed counter-current chromatography, a support-free liq- uid partition chromatographic technique, eliminates irreversible adsorption of the sample onto the solid support, with economy of time and solvent. These results open the perspective for separation processes scaled-up seeking the application of xanthyletin in the control leaf-cutting ant.

According to their voltammetric behavior, the antioxidant activity of these phenolic acids was evaluated and the results pointed to the following sequence: caffeic acid (Ea ¼ þ0:31 V)>chlorogenic acid (+0.38 V)>sinapic acid (+0.45 V)>ferulic acid (+0.53 V)>p-coumaric acid (+0.73 V). The results were conﬁrmed by DPPH test, which evidenced the strongest antiradical activity for compounds possessing the cathecol moiety (caffeic and chlorogenic acids). Linear calibration graphs were obtained for their determination at concentrations from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1. The method was applied to orange juice. Selectivity was illustrated by the analysis of caffeic and chlorogenic acids electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode previously modiﬁed by electrochemical activation in the presence of ascorbic acid. r 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Dietary recommendations for healthy eating include the consumption of fruit juices (Williams, 1995) whose beneﬁcial health effects are mostly ascribed to natural antioxidants. Although the majority of the evidence emphasizes the roles of vitamin E, vitamin C and b-carotene, recent studies have highlighted the importance of the phenolic antioxidants in the total antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jfca.2003.09.013 Citrus phenolics represent a varied and widely studied class of compounds (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The phenolic substances of importance in orange can be classiﬁed into two groups: phenolic acids and related compounds and ﬂavonoids. The most important phenolic acid in orange juice is cinnamic acid and its derivatives: ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids (Robards and Antolovich, 1995). The relative contribution of phenolic derivatives to the antioxidant potential is associated with their effectiveness as hydrogen donors, which is dependent on the number and arrangement of the hydroxyl groups and the extent of structural conjugation, as well as the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring (Rice-Evans et al., 2000; Miller et al., 1993; Clegg and Morton, 1968). The antiradical ability of organic compounds may be assessed by measuring the ease of their reaction with the stable free radical diphenylpycrylhydrazyl (DPPH lmax 517 nm), leading to its reduced form (DPPH-H). Good free radical scavengers react fast leaving small amounts of unreduced DPPH, which indicates the presence of an effective antioxidant (Bonded et al., 1997). In addition to their antioxidant capacity, fruit phenolics have been the subject of increased interest in the last few years because their presence can contribute to the sensory quality of the fruit and juice through their effect on color, bitterness, astringency and ﬂavor. Therefore, different analytical methods are required for their quantiﬁcation (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Cordella et al., 2002). Phenolic substances have characteristic ultraviolet spectra, which have been used to detect adulteration in orange juice by spectrophotometric techniques (Escarpa and Gonz!alez, 2001; Frenzel and Krekler, 1995). These procedures have been replaced by chromatographic procedures, which provide more detailed information on samples containing several organic compounds (Escarpa and Gonz!alez, 2001; Bocchi et al., 1996). For example, analytical procedures for ferulic acid have been based on gas chromatography with ﬂame ionization or electron-capture detection following derivatization. HPLC methods for these phenolic compounds in orange juice have been used involving derivatization and/or solid-phase extraction coupled with UV, photodiode-array and ﬂuorescence detection (Robards and Antolovich, 1995; Bocchi et al., 1996; Moskvin et al., 1999; Karovicov!a and Simko, 2000; Miller and Rice-Evans 1997; Christofersen and Cardwell, 1996). Alternatively, serial coulometric detection of phenolic compounds has been used to generate multivariate data for differentiation of juices (Peyrat- Maillard et al., 2000). The use of cyclic voltammetry as an instrumental tool for the evaluation of the total antioxidant capacity of the low-molecular-weight antioxidants (LMWAs) in both ﬂuids (Chevion et al., 2000) and edible plants (Chevion et al., 1999) is well known. A cyclic voltammogram provides information describing the integrated antioxidant capacity, which arises in large part from the ability of the compound to donate electrons around the potential of the anodic wave. Most of the LMWAs are reducing agents, which quench reactive oxygen species through electron donation (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1985). Therefore, evaluation of the overall reducing power by cyclic voltammetry reﬂects the antioxidant activity of pure compounds as well as that of mixture of compounds. Most of the studies involving LMWA reports ascorbic acid as a major component in the cyclic voltammetry response identiﬁed by measure of anodic peak around +0.4 V vs. Ag/ AgCl/Cl (Yu et al., 1996). Glassy carbon is the electrode material used extensively in electrochemistry for analysis of electroactive substances and as the basis for surface-modiﬁed electrodes. The electrochemical properties of this material can be improved by surface treatment (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 620 Electrochemical activation of the glassy carbon electrode through oxidation and reduction of the electrode surface is a widely used method to change its characteristics. Many authors (Zhang et al., 1996; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Golabi and Zare, 1999; Moreno et al., 2000) have demonstrated that this procedure can improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the electroanalytical method application. For instance, the electrode can present a good performance for catalysis and/or applications as electrochemical detectors for signiﬁcant types of analytes due to selective chemical or physical interaction between speciﬁc functional groups generated on its surface and selective species in solution. In spite of the high sensitivity and selectivity of electroanalytical methods and the great importance of phenolic acids in orange juice, few studies have been conducted on the application of this technique for their determination. So, the aim of the present work was to investigate the electrochemical behavior of cinnamic acid and its derivatives (Fig. 1) on glassy carbon electrode. In addition, the possibility of using electroactivated glassy carbon electrode for oxidation of ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was studied for their selective determination in orange juice without interference of ascorbic acid. In order to conﬁrm the effectiveness of these phenolic acids as free radical scavengers and to correlate this activity with the electrochemical behavior, a spectrophotometric test using DPPH as a substrate was also undertaken. 2.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 621 Metrohm stand 663 VA was used and a glassy carbon disc (0.02 cm2) from Metrohm was used as the working electrode. A carbon auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl/Cl (3.0 mol L1) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrode modiﬁcation was based on the following procedure described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999). The glassy carbon electrode surface was polished with 0.05 mm alumina suspension and rinsed with water. The electrode was immersed in 0.1 mol L1 sodium bicarbonate and submitted to continuous potential cycling from 1.3 to +1.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s1 for 5 min. The activated electrodes were rinsed and placed in a solution containing 1 103 mol L1 of the phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6. The deposition was carried out by dipping and by cycling the potential from 0.1 to +0.8 V at 50 mV s1 during a controlled time of 5 min. After both these processes, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with water and immersed in a solution containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The modiﬁed electrode exhibited a well-shaped cyclic voltammogram corresponding to the reversible oxidation of surface deposited only for caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid and stable current values were obtained only for the cycling method used for the deposition of diphenol compounds. Suprapur grade reagents supplied by Merck and demineralized water from a Milli-Q system (Milli-pore) were used in the preparation of all solutions. Acetate buffer used as a supporting electrolyte was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0.2 mol L1 acetic acid and sodium acetate solution. Ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic, chlorogenic and ascorbic acid stock solutions (1 102 mol L1) were prepared from the dry pure substances in water. An aliquot of the standard solution to be investigated was added by micropipette to 20 mL of deaerated acetate buffer pH 5.6, unless stated otherwise. Analyses of caffeic acid and chlorogenic compounds in orange juice were carried out using three representative samples of natural juice commercialized in Brazil as Danones, Jussys and Batavos. For comparison reasons, all samples examined were recently produced and stored at 10C in obscurity and analyzed shortly after opening. An aliquot of 600 mL of the orange juice (without any previous dilution or extraction) was transferred directly into the voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The previous activated electrode was immersed in this solution and seven uninterrupted voltammetric curves were recorded between +0.1 and +0.8 V at 50 mV s1 when stable curves were obtained. Finally, the cyclic voltammograms were carried out after a step where the electrode was rinsed and placed in a voltammetric cell containing 20 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The mean values of peak currents were obtained and the acids composi- tion determined after standard addition method, when 1 103 mol L1 of caffeic acid solution was added to the original sample and submitted to the deposition step, after which the voltammograms were recorded as shown above. All measurements were analyzed in triplicates. 2.2. Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) The free radical scavenging capacity of ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids was also estimated from its ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 106 to 1 104 mol L1 were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 622 phenolic acid to reduce the absorbance of DPPH solution at 517 nm, followed on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at a glassy carbon electrode Cinnamic acid and its derivatives, ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic, contain reducible oleﬁnic bond or oxidizible phenolic substituents on the aromatic ring that could provide the basis for their voltammetric determination. Nevertheless, only differential pulse voltammo- grams of 1 103 mol L1 of cinnamic acid exhibit one cathodic peak in the pH range 3–7 at very negative potential (1.5 V). The process is attributed to the reduction of the pre-protonated ethylene bond conjugated (H+[C6H5–CHQCH–COOH) after two-electron transfer, as veriﬁed previously by polarographic studies (Ferreira et al., 1996). The inductive effects from ortho and/or para hydroxyl groups to the double bond, which is conjugated with the aromatic ring in the derivatives ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, make the molecule more difﬁcult to reduce. Therefore, the cyclic voltammograms do not exhibit any voltammetric waves for reduction of phenolic derivatives on the useful potential range, and the methods do not demonstrate any analytical potentiality for their determination using the reduction of the oleﬁnic bond in these compounds. On the other hand, typical cyclic voltammograms obtained for all phenolic derivatives are shown in Fig. 2. Except cinnamic acid, which is not oxidized, all the derivatives present well- deﬁned waves, and the shape and the peak potentials are characteristic of each compound. The anodic oxidation of 1.0 103 mol L1 caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have shown only one anodic peak at Epa ¼ þ0:36 V and Epa ¼ þ0:38 V, respectively. Linear plots of peak current (ipa) as a function of n1=2 were obtained indicating that both oxidation processes are diffusion controlled (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). For both compounds, a cathodic peak is observed on the reverse scan. Epc–Epa values obtained from the cyclic voltammograms (n ¼ 20 mV s1) are around 30 mV suggesting a process involving two electrons (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The ratio of the anodic-to-cathodic peak heights (ipc=ipa) increases gradually from 0.8 to 1 with increasing potential sweep rate from 10 to 100 mV s1 and the calculated current functions (ipa n1=2) diminish gradually with the potential scan rate, showing the classical behavior of an oxidation process coupled with a slow subsequent chemical reaction. In order to establish their analytical potentiality, quantitative tests were developed for caffeic and chlorogenic acids using their anodic peaks by linear voltammetric scan. At pH 5.6, the analytical curves are linear from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1 and are described by the following regression lines: ip (mA)=0.08138+2.1472 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.9993, n ¼ 7) for caffeic acid and: ip (mA)=0.05321+1.9571 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.995, n ¼ 6 for chlorogenic acid. The reproducibility of the response was tested using a series of standard solutions of 5 104 mol L1 caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Relative standard deviations of 2.4% and 2.8% were obtained, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1.0 103 mol L1 sinapic, ferulic and coumaric acids in acetate buffer pH 5.6 have also shown one anodic peak at Epa ¼ þ0:45 V, Epa ¼ þ0:53 V and ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 623 Epa ¼ þ0:73 V, respectively. The inﬂuence of scan rate on the cyclic voltammetric parameters was investigated from 0.01 to 3 V s1. The anodic peak appears to correspond to an irreversible process, as no current is observed in the reverse scan. The peak current is proportional to n1=2; indicating that the process is diffusion controlled. The current function decreased markedly up to a highest scan rate. These results suggest that the oxidation step is followed by an electron transfer coupled with a rapid chemical reaction (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). A linear relationship between peak current and sinapic acid and ferulic acid concentrations was obtained from 4 104 to 1 103 mol L1 following the equation: ip (mA)=0.1302+ 0.602 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.9089, n ¼ 7 for sinapic acid and ip ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA I / µA E / mV 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 E / mV E / mV E / mV E (V) E / mV -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0 5 10 15 20 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Fig. 2.

A linear relationship was also obtained for coumaric acid from 4 105 to 1.2 103 mol L1: ip (mA)=0.05705+1.0663 103 C (C=mol L1); correlation coefﬁcient 0.995, n ¼ 7: In agreement with the literature (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Baizer and Lund, 1972), the voltammetric behavior appears to agree with the global mechanism proposed for oxidation of phenol group in aromatic compounds (Baizer and Lund, 1972). The hydroxy groups are oxidized via two electrons transfer leading to the generation of a correspondent quinone after liberation of 2H+. The results have indicated that the higher the number of hydroxy substituents on the aromatic ring, the lower the electrochemical potential. Thus, p-coumaric acids (monophenols) have a higher potential than caffeic and chlorogenic acids (diphenols). Such an order has already been deﬁned by Peyrat-Maillard et al. (2000). In spite of the number of phenolic hydroxyls, the oxidation potential of caffeic and chlorogenic acids also presented a reversible redox couple that was not seen for the oxidation of the other phenolic compounds. The voltammetric behavior indicates that the oxidation process can involve the formation of a stable quinone which is reduced in the reverse scan, as observed in the oxidation of other phenolic compounds with the hydroxy group at the ortho position (Baizer and Lund, 1972). In addition, the introduction of a quinic group on caffeic acid to give chlorogenic acid did not change the oxidation potential. However, the methoxylation of the phenolic groups (sinapic and ferulic acids) increases the peak potential and the rapid decomposition of the correspondent quinone makes the process appear to be an irreversible process since there is no reduction of quinone in the reverse scan. The antioxidant activity of standard phenolic compounds is usually measured according to the method of Cuvelier et al. (1992) based on the accelerated autooxidation of methyl linoleate in anhydrous dodecane using strong oxidizing conditions or by spectrophotometric test measuring the antiradical capacity via reduction of the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (Brand-Williams et al., 1995) or by cyclic voltammetry (Chevion et al., 2000), in addition to several other available methods (Punchard, 1996). In order to test the voltammetric results as a tool to evaluate the antioxidant capacity, the results were compared using the DPPH test (Brand-Williams et al., 1995). The activity of caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids was evaluated based on the ability of each phenolic acid to reduce DPPH (see experimental section). Graphs of reduction of DDPH (%) as a function of different concentrations of phenolic compounds are shown in Fig. 3. The studied phenolic compounds showed free radical scavenging activity decreasing in the following sequence: caffeic acid>chlorogenic acid>sinapic acid>ferulic acid>coumaric acid. This behavior is attributed to the higher ability of diphenols to quench free radicals in solution by easier donation of hydrogen of hydroxy groups and to stabilize the respective radicalar forms due to electron delocalization. As expected, the antioxidant or antiradical activity of most phenolic acids is inversely proportional to their oxidation potential. Diphenols (caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid) show high radical scavenging activities and low oxidation potentials when compared with other acids. Monophenols (p-coumaric acid) are less active and respond at a higher potential which is however smaller than those substituted by methoxy groups (sinapic and ferulic acids). In fact, the potential value is dependent upon the redox behavior of the compounds, reﬂecting their ability to lose electrons. The comparison is similar to that veriﬁed with DPPH measurement. Moreover, the ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 625 signiﬁcant difference noticed for antioxidant activity for caffeic and chlorogenic acids is also conﬁrmed by the shape of the voltammograms which indicates oxidation processes with reversible electron transfer. So, the electrochemical oxidation could be used as a simple model to compare antioxidant activity based on the evaluation of the shape of the voltammogram and the oxidation potential. 3.2. Analysis of orange juice samples In order to investigate the analytical potential of the electrochemical oxidation in determining phenolic derivatives in orange juice, cyclic voltammograms were recorded after a direct transfer of 100–3000 mL of natural orange juice samples to the voltammetric cell containing 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammogram, obtained as described in the experimental section, is shown in Fig. 4. A well-deﬁned oxidation peak at +0.38 V with 3.08 mA of anodic peak current (blank correction) is observed after transference of 600 mL of orange juice Danones, with peak heights proportional to the orange juice addition. Cyclic voltammograms recorded after standard addition of phenolic derivatives from 1 104 to 1 103 mol L1 promote an extra peak at more positive values following the sequence: sinapic (70 mV), ferulic (150 mV) and p-coumaric (360 mV) acids indicating that they are probably not contributing signiﬁcantly to the endogenous peak. Nevertheless, the standard addition of caffeic acid exhibited a concomitant increase in the peak current without any distortion of the peak potential. The same effect was observed with the standard addition of chlorogenic acid indicating that both contributions cannot be split. Interference of ascorbic acid was also tested under the same experimental conditions. Cyclic voltammograms obtained for 1 103 mol L1 of ascorbic acid in acetate buffer pH 5.6 presents ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 b c d a e fractional convertion of DPPH % Concentration µmol L-1 Fig. 3.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 626 an irreversible oxidation peak at +0.42V, which was identiﬁed as potentially interfering in the analysis of phenolic compounds in orange juice, too. Similar results were obtained when the described method was applied to the determination of phenolic acids in commercial orange juice assigned as Batavos and Jussys. The voltammograms obtained for 600mL of orange juice in 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6 present oxidation peaks similar to those previously detected, with peak currents of 2.8270.21 and 2.7570.17mA (values represent means of triplicate determinations), respectively. The peak height increases with standard addition of caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid or ascorbic acid, indicating value media of total phenolic compounds of 244.8737mg L1 (n ¼ 3). So, taking into consideration the fact that cyclic voltammetry could provide information about the total antioxidant capacity, without the speciﬁc determination of the contribution of each individual component, the method was tested using activated glassy carbon electrode. 3.3. Voltammetric behavior of some phenolic acids at modiﬁed glassy carbon electrode As described previously (Golabi and Zare, 1999; Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997), glassy carbon electrode activated previously in bicarbonate solution can have its surface modiﬁed by active groups, where quinones, imidazolic groups and enzymes could be electrodeposited. Therefore, the analytical potentiality of the activated glassy carbon electrode obtained as described in the experimental section was investigated to determine phenolic compounds based on its interaction with the modiﬁed electrode. The voltammetric response of glassy carbon electrode activated by continuous potential cycles from 1.3 to +1.6 V at a sweep of 50 mV s1 (50 cycles) in sodium bicarbonate (0.1 mol L1) solution does not exhibit any electroactive sites in the potential range from –0.4 to +1.0 V. Two different deposition methods of phenolic compounds were employed. These methods involved dipping and cycling of the potential during the electrodeposition process.

Linear sweep voltammograms of 600 mL of orange juice Danones in 10 mL of acetate buffer pH 5.6 before (Curve 1) and after standard addition of 4 105 mol L1 (Curve 2) and 1 104 mol L1 of caffeic acid on glassy carbon electrode. n ¼ 100 mV s1. W.R. Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 627 In the former method, the electrode was washed and transferred to a beaker containing 1 103 mol L1 of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6 solution. After carefully rinsing with water, the electrode was placed in a solution of 0.1 mol L1 acetate buffer previously purged with nitrogen. In the latter method, the activated electrode was rinsed and placed in a 1 103 mol L1 solution of phenolic compounds in acetate buffer pH 5.6, where it was submitted to seven potential cyclings between +0.1 and +0.8 V (at 50 mV s1). The electrode was then removed to a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6. The cyclic voltammograms obtained for both methods using caffeic acid were recorded at 100 mV s1. A redox couple of peaks at +0.33/+0.30 V attributed to oxidation of phenol/quinone was observed for both methods, with characteristics close to those expected in a system involving surface process (Bard and Faulkner, 1980). The voltammetric curves obtained using the cycling method present a higher peak intensity (Fig. 5). Successive scans (Curve n of Fig. 5) have shown constant values of current after the ﬁrst scan indicating that the remaining material is quite persistent on the electrode surface. The results obtained using the dipping method have shown repetitive voltammograms with continuous decay during the continuous scanning of potential indicating that the material is released due to weak bound to the surface. So, the results obtained for both processes indicate that caffeic acid can be deposited on the electrode surface due to a weak interaction with the phenolic group (dipping) or strong interaction with quinone groups generated after successive oxidation (cycling). The most effective method was the electrodeposition of caffeic acid onto glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution using cycling potential and it was chosen as the best condition for analysis of the phenolic compounds. The inﬂuence of cycling time from +0.1 to +0.8 V during accumulation of caffeic acid on the voltammetric response obtained for activated electrode was investigated immersing the previously ARTICLE IN PRESS 100 200 300 400 500 600 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 n 1 ip(µΑ) POTENTIAL (mV) Fig. 5.

After a controlled time, the load electrode was removed to the voltammetric cell containing acetate buffer pH 5.6. The current increased linearly up to 5 min of exposition, showing that the analyte is easily and rapidly accumulated on the electrode surface. At higher time, the current reaches a plateau indicating saturation of the electrode surface. In order to assess the reproducibility of the electrode response, a series of 10 repetitive measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammograms (at 100 mV s1) recorded for the activated electrode immersed in 1 103 mol L1 caffeic acid solution and transported to a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6. The electrode response indicated a mean current peak value of 4.2470.12 mA, where the coefﬁcient of variation calculated was 4.3%. Under these experimental conditions, the calibration plots were tested immersing the coated electrode in caffeic acid solution containing 1 104– 1 103 mol L1 using a controlled time of cycling of 5 min. Linear relationship was observed between ipa vs. concentration from 1.0 104 to 7.5 104 mol L1 following the equation: ip (mA)=0.2796+7.813 103 (C=moles L1), r ¼ 0:9988; n ¼ 6: Constant values of peak current were always obtained above the concentration of 1 103 mol L1, as shown in Fig. 6, suggesting saturation of the electrode surface. The detection limit was calculated (LD=3 sd/slope) to be 1 105 mol L1. The cyclic voltammograms obtained using the procedure described previously have shown that chlorogenic acid can also be deposited on glassy carbon electrodes activated previously in bicarbonate solution. A pair of redox peaks is observed due to oxidation of chlorogenic acid loaded in the electrode surface with similar electrochemical behavior observed for caffeic acid. The oxidation processes of p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids on activated glassy carbon electrodes are quite different from the behavior described for caffeic and chlorogenic ARTICLE IN PRESS 0 2 4 6 8 10 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 Ip(µΑ) Concentration (x10-4 mol L-1) Fig. 6.

Sousa et al. / Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 17 (2004) 619–633 629 acids. The cyclic voltammograms recorded after activated electrode transference to a voltammetric cell containing 1 103 mol L1 of these phenolic compounds exhibit the expected behavior of that veriﬁed at bare electrode. But, when the electrode is rinsed and placed in a new solution of acetate buffer pH 5.6 there is no voltammetric signal, indicating that there is no remaining material on the activated electrode surface. The electrodeposition mechanism of o-, p-quinones onto activated glassy carbon electrode has been described (Zare and Golabi, 1999; Ozkan et al., 1994, 1997). The deposition of such compounds has been explained on the basis of a nucleophilic attack of quinones produced from the oxidation of phenolic compounds. When an activated glassy carbon electrode is used as a surface for electrooxidation of chlorogenic acid or caffeic acid, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the electrode act as nucleophiles against the o-quinone anodically formed. Such a process leads to bond formation and development of a stable modiﬁed electrode. The absence of o-hydroxyl substituents in the chemical structure or the irreversibility of the process observed during electrochemical oxidation, respectively, of p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic and ascorbic acids, probably hinders this interaction or enhances the release rate from the surface and reduces the utility of activated glassy carbon electrode to pre-concentrate these phenolic compounds. So, taking into consideration the selective interaction between activated glassy carbon electrode and caffeic acid and/or chlorogenic compounds, without interference of ascorbic acid, the applicability of the method was tested in three different samples of orange juice. Quantiﬁcation of the caffeic acid content in orange juice was accomplished by multiple standard additions of caffeic acid on activated glassy carbon electrode as described in the experimental section. Five milliliters of the orange juice was directly diluted in the voltammetric cell by adding it to 15 mL of pH 5.6 acetate buffer. After 10 cycles between the potential of +0.1 and +0.8 V, the activated glassy carbon electrode was replaced in a solution containing only acetate buffer pH 5.6 and characteristic cyclic voltammograms were obtained before and after the standard addition of caffeic acid. This method was also tested for aliquots of orange juice from 1.00 to 10.00 mL and the peak current increases up to a dilution limit of 50% in juice:buffer. The peak rise at +0.4 V obtained in all voltammograms also increases with the amount of chlorogenic acid added as standard solution addition but has not shown any interference of p-coumaric, sinapic, ferulic or ascorbic acid, indicating that the modiﬁed electrode has shown high selectivity to caffeic acid or chlorogenic acid determination. The results obtained using the proposed method based on standard addition of caffeic acid are shown in Curves A and B of Fig. 7. The results obtained from the repetitions indicate that 2.4270.28 mg L1 of caffeic/chlorogenic acids are present in the Batavo orange juice samples. Danones commercial orange juice presented 2.1570.56 mg L1 and Jussys, 1.8570.39 mg L1, respectively. The results obtained using the proposed method are in agreement with the values provided by the literature (Robards and Antolovich, 1995) which indicate that caffeic and chlorogenic acids are the major cinnamic acid derivatives in orange juice and their usual concentrations are around 0.1–2 mg L1 in commercial orange juices. 4. Conclusions From these studies, it was concluded that cyclic voltammetry is a rapid, simple and efﬁcient instrumental tool for evaluating the antioxidant capacity of phenolic derivatives: ferulic, p- ARTICLE IN PRESS W.R.

So, it has been considered as a potential drug candidate. In the early drug development process, drug metabolism is one of the main parameters that should be evaluated; therefore, the biotransformation of this lignan by rat liver microsomes was investigated for the ﬁrst time. In order to perform the biotransformation study and to determine the kinetic parameters, a sim- ple, sensitive and selective HPLC method was developed and fully validated. After method validation, the biotransformation study was accomplished and the kinetic parameters were determined. The biotrans- formation study obeyed the Michaelis–Menten kinetics.

Introduction (−)-Grandisin (Fig. 1) is a known tetrahydrofuran lignan isolated from Piperaceae, Lauraceae, Myristicaceae and Schisandraceae species [1–3]. This compound has displayed different biologi- cal properties, such as larvicidal activity against the mosquito Aedes aegypti [4], trypanocidal activity against the trypamastig- ote form of Trypanossoma cruzi [5–7], and antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities [8]. In the last years, many studies on cytotoxicity and antitumoral activity showed that (−)-grandisin is a potential candidate as an anticancer agent [9–11]. The oxidative metabolism has been extensively investigated in the last two decades by means of biological simulating models, using perfused organs, isolated cells or cell fragments (micro- somes) [12]. Its importance lies on the fact that the drug candidates, before the ﬁnal developmental steps as drugs, must be evaluated as ∗Corresponding author at: Faculdade de Filosoﬁa, Ciências e Letras de Ribeirão Preto, USP, Av.

In addition, the knowledge on interactions of new drug candidates towards oxidative enzymes, their afﬁnity and speed of metabolism is of fundamental importance, particularly when investigations of drug interactions is concerned. The in vivo study of hepatic metabolism can be estimated from the “turnover” or intrinsic clearance, derived from in vitro tissue preparations. Species-speciﬁc metabolism allows for the extrapola- tion from animals to humans with an additional level of assurance. Since human studies are generally impractical, unethical, or too costly, in vitro systems are the most relevant way to compare metabolic rates between species. To best utilize this approach, the mechanism needs to be conserved across species. For metabolism studies, the enzymatic processes need to be qualitatively the same [13]. Many laboratories have used liver microsomes to perform such metabolism studies. Hepatic microsomes are a ﬂexible sys- tem, are a straightforward preparation and they can be stored, with long-term availability [12]. They probably represent one of the most widely used in vitro system for investigating the metabolic proﬁle of a new drug candidate [14,15]. The recent appreciation of the metabolism study became apparent that understanding the fundamental properties of the enzyme kinetics of cytochrome 0731-7085/$ – see front matter © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical structure of the lignan (−)-grandisin. P450, and thus the rate of biotransformation of a new drug can- didate, becomes a parameter of crucial importance in shaping the therapeutic proﬁle [16]. The advantages arising from these studies are mainly to provide information on the biochemical characteris- tics of a new drug candidate substance increasing the relevance for future clinical studies [17]. Due to the potential of (−)-grandisin as a new lead compound mainly against cancer, the aim of this paper was to characterize its metabolism employing rat liver microsomal fraction (a mammalian species) by evaluating the Michaelis–Menten kinetics parameters (Vmax, Km), the intrinsic clearance (CLint) and the formation of metabolites. 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemical and reagents The tetrahydrofuran lignan (−)-grandisin used in the present work was extracted and puriﬁed from Piper solmsianum (Piper- aceae) according to previous procedures [18]. Standard stock solution of the lignan (−)-grandisin was prepared at the concen- tration of 1.15 mmol L−1 in methanol. Calibration curve solutions of the lignan (−)-grandisin in the range of 0.00115–1.15 mmol L−1 were obtained by dilutions in the same solvent mixture. These solutions were stored at −20 ◦C and protected from light. HPLC grade methanol, acetonitrile, hexane, were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and from J.T. Baker (Philipsburg, NJ, USA). Sodium chloride and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Sodium hydroxide and potas- sium chloride were obtained from Nuclear (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Glycerol and Tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane were obtained from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy) and hydrochloric acid was obtained from Chemco (Campinas, SP, Brazil). NADP+, glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2. HPLC conditions Chromatographic analyzes were conducted using a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) liquid chromatography equipped with an LC10-AD VP solvent pump unit, an SCL-10A VP system controller, a CTO- 10AS VP column oven and an SPD-M10A VP diode array detector operating in the range of 200–400 nm. Injections were performed manually through a 50 L loop with a Rheodyne model 7725i injector (Rheodyne, Cotati, CA, USA). Data were collected using the Class VP software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The resolution of the lignan (−)-grandisin was performed at 25 ◦C on a Kromasil® C18 column, 5 m particle size (250 mm × 4.6 mm, Eka Chemicals, Bohus, Sweden). A C18 column (4.6 mm × 12.5 mm, 5 m particle size, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as guard column. The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile:water (60:40, v/v) and the ﬂow rate was 1 mL min−1. 2.3. Extraction procedure and method validation To extract the lignan from the rat liver microsomes it was employed a liquid–liquid extraction as sample preparation. The extraction was performed employing 4 mL hexane. The samples were shaked for 10 min in a Vibrax VXR (IKA, Staufen, Germany) and then centrifuged for 5 min at 2860 × g. The supernatant was collected (3 mL) and let to evaporate to dryness under a gently stream of compressed air. After that, the residue was reconsti- tuted in 100 L of the mobile phase and 50 L was injected in the chromatography system. The linearity of the method was performed in triplicate and the results were weighted by 1/x2. The results of the linearity were weighted because the residual analysis of the analytical curve showed a heteroscedasticity behavior [19]. Calibration curves (n = 3) were obtained by spiking aliquots of 1.0 mL drug-free rat microsomes samples with standard solutions of the (−)-grandisin. The ﬁnal concentration range in the rat microsomes was 0.028, 0.57, 1.44, 2.31, 5.78 and 28.93 M. In addition, the linearity of the cali- bration curve was assessed by ANOVA Lack of ﬁt test using a p value of 0.05. MINITAB Release, version 14.1 (State College, PA, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis. The limit of quantiﬁcation was deﬁned as the lowest concentra- tion that could be determined with accuracy and precision below 20% [20] over ﬁve analytical run and it was obtained using rat microsomes samples (1.0 mL) spiked with 0.028 M of the lignan. Precision was expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD%) and accuracy as percent of deviation between the true and the mea- sured value. To assess within-day precision and accuracy, replicate analyzes (n = 5) of 1.0 mL of rat microsomes spiked at concen- trations of 0.57, 5.78 and 23.14 M of the (−)-grandisin were performed. For between-day assays, quintuplicate rat microsome samples of each concentration were analyzed for three consecutive days (n = 3) [20]. The absolute recovery of the lignan (−)-grandisin extracted from the rat microsome samples spiked with the concen- trations of 0.057, 2.89 and 17.3 M (n = 3, for each concentration), was determined using calibration curves obtained from the data of the analytes not submitted to extraction. The recovery was expressed as percentage of the amount extracted and the relative standard deviation was evaluated. The selectivity of the method was assured by analyzing standard solutions of some reagents that are employed in the in vitro metabolism experiment. These reagents were tested employing a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1. Drug-free rat microsome samples were also analyzed to assess the capacity of sample pretreatment to eliminate matrix interference. Short-term stability test at 37 ◦C and at room temperature was determined (n = 6). Aliquots of rat liver microsomes spiked with low (0.57 M) and high concentration (23.14 M) of (−)-grandisin were prepared and kept at 37 ◦C under water bath during 120 min. The samples were prepared and kept in the laboratory during 6 h to perform the room temperature stability. The lignan (−)-grandisin peak area obtained from stability tests was compared with the peak area obtained with freshly prepared samples. One-way ANOVA was applied, with the level of signiﬁcance set at p ≤ 0.05. 2.4. Animals and microsomal preparation Male Wistar rats weighting 180–220 g were obtained from Fac- ulty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto – University of São Paulo (Ethical Approval no. 10.1.848.53.2). Animals were fed in a normal condition and acclimatized at 12 h light/dark cycle. The animals were sacriﬁced by decapitation and the livers were removed and placed in ice-cold 0.05 mol L−1 Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.15 mol L−1 KCl. The livers were minced with scissors and washed three times with Tris–HCl buffer. After that, the slices were homogenated with MA 181 potter equipment 242 G.B. Messiano et al. / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 72 (2013) 240– 244 (Marconi, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil). The homogenate was centrifuged in a HIMAC CF 15D2 centrifuge (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 ◦C and the resulting supernatant was ultracen- trifuged employing a XL-70 Beckman ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 ◦C in order to obtain the microsomal pellet. The obtained pellet was resuspended in 0.05 mol L−1 HEPES–HCl buffer (pH 7.4), containing 20% glycerol and 0.001 mol L−1 EDTA and stored at −70 ◦C until use. The protein concentration was determinated by the biuret method using a BCA kit (Labtest, MG, Brazil). 2.5. Microsomal incubation conditions The optimal conditions for microsomal incubation were deter- mined in the linear range for the disappearance of (−)-grandisin from the medium. Incubations were performed in quintuplicate (n = 5) with the reconstituted rat liver microsomes in 10 mL amber tubes, using a shaking water bath at 37 ◦C. The incubation mix- ture consisted of a cofactor solution, microsomal preparation (rat liver microsomes), phosphate buffer 0.250 mol L−1 pH 7.4 and substrate (25 L, 0.028–28.93 M) in a total volume of 1.0 mL. The cofactor solution consisted of NADP+ (0.25 mM), glucose-6- phosphate (5 mM) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.5 units) in Tris–HCl buffer (Tris–HCl 0.05 mol L−1 – KCl 0.15 mol L−1, pH 7.4). After 5 min prewarmed at 37 ◦C, the metabolic reaction was initiated by the addition of the rat microsomal preparation. The microsomal protein concentration was evaluated from 0.0 to 5.0 mg protein (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0 mg protein) (n = 5) and it was incubated by 0–320 min (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 280 and 320 min). After this period, the reaction was terminated by the addition of hexane (4.0 mL). This mixture was agitated for 10 min in a Vibrax VXR agitator and then cen- trifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm. Finally, 3.0 mL of the supernatant was collected and let to evaporate until complete dryness under compressed air. After that, the residue was reconstituted in 100 L of the mobile phase and 50 L was injected into the chromato- graphic system. Control incubations were performed in the absence of cofactor solution and in the absence of microsomal preparation. The difference between ‘with’ and ‘without’ NADPH was considered as CYP450-mediated metabolism. 2.6. Metabolism data analysis The Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetic constants (Vmax and Km) for the lignan (−)-grandisin in vitro metabolism were calculated by nonlinear regression using Prism Software (5.0). Furthermore, the intrinsic clearance (CLint) of (−)-grandisin in rat liver microsomes was calculated based on the ratio of Vmax to Km. 2.7. Structural determination of the metabolite by GC/MS Each sample analyzed for the reaction, total of three samples, was pooled from a 10 single reactions due to the low concentration of the substrate and consequently of the possible products. The same procedure of making a pool was performed for the control, however only one sample was analyzed. After dried under a stream of compressed air, the samples were diluted in ethyl acetate to 1.0 mL and 1.0 L was injected in GC–MS. The sample was diluted to avoid any overload of the sample into the GC capillary column. The GC–MS used was a Shimadzu® model QP2010 with the auto sam- pler and auto injector model AOC5000. The column used was ZB-5 MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 L, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The oven temperature was programmed as to start the temperature at 120 ◦C for 4 min. Then, the temperature was increased at the rate 8 ◦C min−1 until 300 ◦C and maintained constant for more 12 min. Other GC parameters were: injector temperature at 250 ◦C, column ﬂow 1.0 mL min−1, and linear velocity 37.5 cm s−1. The injection proceeded in a splitless mode with 1.0 min of sampling time. In the MS, the ionization by electrons was done using energy of 70 eV, ion source at 250 ◦C and acquisition by scan from m/z 40 to 500. The interface temperature used was 280 ◦C and the solvent delay time was 4 min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Chromatographic determination and method validation The method used to determine the (−)-grandisin metabolism was validated according to FDA guidelines for the analysis of drugs in biological ﬂuids [20]. Since there is not any ofﬁcial guide for ana- lytical method validation in metabolism studies, it was decided to follow the FDA guideline (at least partially) due to the char- acteristic of the matrix employed in this study (microsomes) and due to the high degree of acceptability of this guideline. Method validation is an important step in the development of any study dedicated to quantiﬁcation. At this stage, it is possible to ﬁnd out if the developed method is suitable for the desired application and to come across analyte characteristics, such as its stability under different conditions that can affect the analytical results. The chromatographic quantiﬁcation was carried out on a Kromasil® C18 column using a mixture of acetonitrile:water (60:40, v/v) as mobile phase. The retention time of the (−)-grandisin was 15.1 min under this condition. The proposed method showed to be linear over the concentration range of 0.028–28.93 M, with correla- tion coefﬁcient (r) ≥ 0.9955 and y = 1178993x + 5094. The lack-of-ﬁt test showed that the analytical curve obeys a linear model with F = 1.58 and p = 0.211. The precision and accuracy of the method were assessed for both within-day (ﬁve spiked microsome sam- ples for each concentration on the same day) and between-day (ﬁve spiked microsome samples for each concentration for three consecutive days) determinations. Table 1 shows the results for within-day and between-day precision. The obtained values are in agreement with literature recommendations [20]. The lowest concentration quantiﬁed by the validated method was 0.028 M with a relative standard deviation value below 10% and relative error of −3.86%. The absolute recovery of the lignan (−)-grandisin extracted from the rat microsome samples spiked with the con- centrations of 0.057, 2.89 and 17.3 M was 77.7%, 88.3% and 88.1%, respectively, with RSD below 15%. The selectivity test showed no interferences from the biological matrix in the retention time of the substrate or the produced metabolite (Fig. 2C). The short-term sta- bility test at 37 ◦C and at room temperature showed no degradation of the substrate in the evaluated conditions with p value ≥0.1429 (Table 2). 3.2. In vitro metabolism study The studied substrate (−)-grandisin has shown several phar- macological effects, such as cytotoxicity and antiangiogenic effects [8], antinocicoptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities [7], protective effect against cyclophosphamide-induced mutagenicity in mice [9] and trypanocidal activities [5,6]. Due to these several activ- ities and no report regarding the metabolism of this lignan by mammalian, it was proposed to evaluate the behavior of this substrate towards the cytochrome rat hepatic enzymes, since mam- malian metabolism studies should be established in the early drug development. The metabolism rate should be performed in linear conditions in relation to incubation time and microsomal protein concentration to determine the Michaelis–Menten parameters. Ini- tially, the microsomal protein concentration was varied from 0.0 to 5.0 mg protein (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and G.B.

Thus, 2.0 mg mL−1 was chosen as the microsomal protein concentration to be further applied in the biotransformation study. Once known the protein concentra- tion, the next step was the optimization of the incubation time. The incubation time was varied from 0 to 320 min (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 280 and 320 min). The linearity was achieved in the range of 90–180 min (r = 0.978) and 180 min was chosen as the incubation time to be further applied in the determination of the kinetic parameters. After the optimization of the micro- somal protein content and incubation time, the Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters were determinated by varying the substrate concentration. The substrate concentration was varied in the range of 0.028–28.93 M. Fig. 3 shows the Michaelis–Menten plot for lignan (−)-grandisin after metabolism by rat liver microsomes. The initial velocity of (−)-grandisin disappearance was dependent upon substrate concentration of 11.57 M, approaching substrate saturation at 23.14 M. The Michaelis–Menten rate parame- ters for the microsomal CYP450 metabolism of (−)-grandisin were calculated using nonlinear regression. It was observed a Vmax = 1.46 ± 0.034 mol/mg protein/h and Km = 8.99 ± 0.488 M Table 2 Stability test (n = 6) of the developed method. Nominal conc.

Fig. 2A shows the chro- matogram of the (−)-grandisin metabolism after 100 min. The major CYP450 isoforms present in rats are CYP3A2, CYP2C11, CYP1A1/1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D1 and CYP2B1/2. Between them, CYP3A2 (corresponding to human CYP3A4), CYP2C11 (correspond- ing to human CYP2C9) and CYP1A1/1A2 (corresponding to human CYP1A2) represent more than 60% of the total rat CYP amount [21,22]. Therefore, these isoforms might be involved in the lig- nan biotransformation. However, a more detailed study should be conducted employing isolated CYP isoforms (cDNA-expresses system-supersomes®) or speciﬁc anti-CYP antibodies to ﬁnd out, exactly, which isoform(s) is(are) involved in the (−)-grandisin metabolism. The metabolism study showed the formation of a dihydro derivative metabolite. There are studies reporting the metabolism of the (−)-grandisin employing species of fungi [23] and Coleoptera and Lepidoptera species [24]. These studies show mainly the pro- duction of demethylated phenolic derivatives or the cleavage of the molecule losing an aromatic ring. At the present paper, it was observed the formation of a dihydro metabolite probably by an initial oxidation on the furan ring followed by a water molecule elimination. The proposal was based in the major fragment ions. The molecular ion was observed at m/z 430 showing less than two mass units in comparison with grandisin. For grandisin, an impor- tant pathway starts with the loss of half compound by the opening of tetrahydrofuran ring. These fragments occur at m/z 208 and 224, while for the metabolite, these fragments were missed and no other correlated mass were observed, showing an alteration in the central ring. A recent study applying bioorganic catalysis led the isola- tion of dehydro-grandisin. Its structure and the physic-chemical constants were determined by EI MS, ESI MS, 1H NMR, speciﬁc rota- tion, and circular dichroism [25]. Both substances have the identical EI MS spectrum and retention time during the analysis by GC–MS which conﬁrm the structure of the metabolite produced by hepatic microsome assay. As the chemical model induces oxidation, reason that this reac- tion is considered a biomimetic model of CYP, this result indicated Fig. 3. Michaelis–Menten kinetics plot. Metabolism conditions described in Section 2.5. 244 G.B. Messiano et al. / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 72 (2013) 240– 244 an oxidation following by a dehydration, despite some reduction reactions have been related to some compounds in metabolism reactions [26,27]. However, for the precise pathway for the pro- duction of this metabolite, some experiments using speciﬁcs CYP and labeled hydrogen atoms in tetrahydrofuran ring should be per- formed. Otherwise, considering that grandisin is a molecule with few positions for oxidation or reduction, these studies could sup- port and provide important information about the grandisin in vivo metabolism. 4. Conclusion This paper describes, for the ﬁrst time, the CYP450-mediated biotransformation of a promising natural product hit, the lig- nan (−)-grandisin, using rat microsomal preparation. The kinetic parameters indicated that the biotransformation of this natural product obeys the Michaelis–Menten kinetics and the metabolism indicated the formation of 2,5-dihydro-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-bis(3,4,5- trimethoxyphenyl)-furan as metabolite. It is the ﬁrst report about the metabolism of this lignan using mammalian models.

In addition, it is becoming very difﬁcult to discover new leads structures solely by synthetic means [1]. Therefore, modern strategies for discovering new agrochemical, i.e. insecticides, herbicides, etc. are focused on natural products, because they often have a reduced environmental impact, are biodegradable and may have new sites of interaction and speci- ﬁcity. In a program oriented towards the discovery of novel photo- synthetic inhibitors, we identiﬁed diverse secondary metabolites such as chromenes, benzofurans, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, lac- tones, and terpenes from selected Mexican plants [2]. Furoquinoline alkaloids have attracted much interest due to their broad range of biological activities including various physiological and pharmaco- logical activities [3,4]. In a previous work bioactive constituents from Swinglea glutinosa (Rutaceae) [4–7], and from Hortia superba (Rutaceae) were isolated and characterized. Quinolone alkaloids, ﬂindersine, N-methyl-ﬂindersine and acridone alkaloids inhibit the light reactions of photosynthesis [8]. The acridone alkaloids that contain 2,3,5,6-dehydro-4-oxopiperidine nucleus were the most ac- tive. As a contribution on the research of the Rutaceae family, in this work we report the isolation of ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids: evoli- trine (1), kokusaginine (2), c-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4) and mac- ulosidine (5) (Fig. 1) from a Brazilian tree Balfourodendron riedelianum. The plant is used in the Brazilian folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments [9]. In the search for natural product that may have herbicide activity, we studied ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids and found that four of them act as photosynthetic inhibitors. We investigated the mechanism of action of furoquinoline alkaloids 1– 5 on the light reaction of photosynthesis and their possible targets on the electron transport chain on thylakoids and leaves discs. Among the techniques suitable for assessing the electron transport ﬂow in the light reactions of photosynthesis on plants subjected to chemical stress, polarography (measuring oxygen evolution and using appropriate electron acceptors, donors and inhibitors) and ﬂuorescence induction curves of chlorophyll a of photosystem II (PS II) were employed in the present work. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence data were analyzed by the ‘‘JIP-test analysis’’ [10]. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Stock solutions of 1–5 were prepared using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as solvent and its maximum concentration in the medium was less than 0.5%. Log P Parameters and Molar volume of the alkaloids were deter- mined for each compound by the program Chem stech from www.ACD labs.com. 2.2. Puriﬁcation and Isolation of the furoquinoline alkaloids (1–5) The dichloromethane extract (2.1 g) obtained from the stem barks of B. riedelianum was subjected to a counter current chroma- tography, in the RLCC (Rotation Locular Counter Chromatography, RLCC-1000, Eyela ceramic bomb VSP-3050) apparatus using chlo- roform/methanol/isopropanol/water (45:60:2:40), as stationary phase in an automatic collector (Eyela fraction collector DC-120). The apparatus loop was 3.0 mL to give a group of 24 fractions in a chloroform solution stationary phase (0.3626 g), which was subjected to a column over Sephadex LH-20 (430 mm 30 mm, 300 g) and the elution was carried out with methanol (100%) to give 7 fractions. From the fraction 3 (0.0902 g) the alkaloid 3 was obtained and from the fraction 6 (0.0137 g) 1 and 2 were isolated, and the compound 4 was isolated from the fraction 5 (0.0437 g). These metabolites were identiﬁed by spectroscopic and spectro- metric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, including 2D experiments (HSQC and HMBC), the data were compared with previous report [12–14]. A solution of methanol/H2O (25%) of the methanol extract (58.6 g) obtained from the stem bark of Balfourodendrum riedelia- num and then subjected to a liquid extraction to get n-hexane (5.5 g), dichloromethane (26.4 g) and ethyl acetate (2.8 g) frac- tions. The dichloromethane fraction was subjected to a chromato- graphic column (silica ﬂash, 47.0 5.5 cm). The gradient elution was carried out with hexane to methanol, giving eleven fractions. The fraction 9 (1.45 g) gave rise to a new chromatographic column [silica ﬂash + ﬂorisil (1:1), 70.0 2.5 cm] with gradient of elution (hexane to methanol) providing seven fractions (I–VII). The frac- tion IV (0.95 g) was subjected to another silica ﬂash/Florisil (1:1) column (71.0 2.5 cm, eluted with gradient of hexane – ethyl ace- tate), giving ﬁve new fractions (A–E). The fraction E (0.06 g) was subjected to a preparative thin-layer chromatography (20 20 cm, 1 mm), eluted with dichloromethane (100%) to isolate maculosidine (5) (0.02 g). This compound was identiﬁed with spec- troscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, as previ- ously reported [12–14]. 2.3. Chloroplasts isolation and chlorophyll determination Intact chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves (Spinacea oleracea L.) obtained from a local market as previously described [15,16]. Chloroplasts were isolated with a medium that contained: 400 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and buffered with 3 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, then they were re-suspended in the same medium and stored as a concentrated suspension in the dark for 1 h at 0 C. 2.4. Measurement of ATP synthesis To measure ATP synthesis, intact chloroplasts (20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were broken by osmotic rupture in the following low-buffered solution: 100 mM sorbitol, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM KCN, 50 lM methylviologen (MV) (as electron acceptor at FX level), 1 mM K+-tricine (pH 8.0), and 1 mM ADP, pH adjusted to 8.0 with KOH. The ATP synthesis was determined titrimetrically using a microelectrode Orion model 8103 Ross connected to a Corning potentiometer model 12, with expanded scale as previ- ously reported [15,17]. The linear rate of alkalization in the light was calibrated by back-titration with saturated HCl, the ATP formed was calculated as lmol ATP mg Chl1 h1. 2.5. Measurement of non-cyclic electron transport rate The Light-induced non-cyclic electron transport activity from water to MV was determined with an oxygen monitors YSI (Yellow Springs Instrument) model 5300 using a Clark type electrode as previously published [15,18]. Chloroplasts (equivalent of 20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were freshly lysed in 3 mL of the basal electron transport reaction med- ium: 100 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KCN, 30 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, and 50 lM MV and measured the basal electron ﬂow by polarography. Phosphorylating non-cyclic elec- tron transport from water to MV was measured as basal non-cyclic electron transport medium except that 1 mM ADP and 3 mM KH2- PO4 were added to the reaction medium. Uncoupled electron trans- port from water to MV was tested as the basal non-cyclic electron transport, and 6 mM NH4Cl was added as uncoupler to the med- ium. All reaction mixture was illuminated for 1 min with an actinic light of a projector lamp (GAF 2660) passed through a 5 cm ﬁlter of CuSO4 at 2% w/v.

Uncoupled photosystem II (PS II) and Uncoupled photosystem I (PS I) electron ﬂow determination Uncoupled PS II from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) [19] was monitored polarographically. DCBQ accepts elec- trons at the D1 protein, and thus we measured the electron trans- port from water to QB. The reaction medium for assaying PS II activity was the same used for basal electron transport, except that MV was omitted and 1 lM 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4- benzoquinone (DBMIB), 100 lM DCBQ and 6 mM NH4Cl were added. Partial reaction of PS II electron transport from water to so- dium silicomolybdate (SiMo) was determined as in PS II with the same basal electron transport medium without MV, and 50 lM SiMo and 10 lM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were added [20]. These electron ﬂow activities were monitored with a yellow spring instrument (YSI) oxygen monitor, model 5300 using a Clark type electrode. Uncoupled PS I electron transport was determined using the basal electron transport medium, plus 10 lM DCMU (to inhibit PSII at QB level), 100 lM of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) were re- duced with 300 lM ascorbate and uncoupled with 6 mM NH4Cl [21]. The I50 value for each activity was extrapolated using the graph of percentage of activity versus concentration of compounds. I50 is the concentration producing 50% inhibition of the activity. 2.7. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II measurements in thylakoids Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence transients were measured with a Handy-PEA (Plant Efﬁcient Analyzer, from Hansatech, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, UK) as previously described [16]. The maximum ﬂuores- cence yield from the sample was generated by illumination for 2 s with continuous light (650 nm peak wavelength, intensity equivalent of 2830 lmol photons m2 s1 and gain of 0.7.) pro- vided by an array of three light-emitting diodes. The reaction med- ium used was that employed in basal non-cyclic electron transport measurements with MV. To monitor Chl a ﬂuorescence transients, aliquots of dark-adapted thylakoids for 5 min containing 60 lg of Chl were transferred to ﬁlter paper by gravity with a dot-blot appa- ratus (Bio-Rad, United States) in order to ensure a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of thylakoids. The ﬁlter paper was dipped immediately in 3 mL of the medium with different concen- trations of the tested compounds, and the control contained med- ium plus the amount of DMSO employed for each compound at the different used concentrations. Chloroplasts inﬁltrated with 10 lM DCMU and chloroplasts pre- viously treated with 0.8 M Tris ((hydroxymetyl)-aminomethan) were used as positive control. Chloroplasts were incubated with slight agitation for 30 min at 4 C with 0.8 M Tris at pH 8.0 [22]. The OJIP transients were analyzed according to the JIP test and the measured parameters were: ﬂuorescence intensity level (Fo) when plastoquinone electron acceptor pool (QA) is fully oxidized and ﬂuorescence level when QA is transiently fully reduced (FM). F1 is the ﬂuorescence intensity level at 0.05 ms, F2 at 0.1 ms, F3 at 0.3 ms, F4 or FJ at 2 ms, F5 at 30 ms. Area is the area over the curve between Fo and FM, and relates the pool size of PS II electron trans- port acceptors [23]. From these parameters other derived parame- ters were calculated (Table 1) with the program Biolyzer HP3 (from Laboratory University of Geneva; available at http://www. unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen). The ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a transients were normalized using the equation Vt = (Ft Fo)/ FM Fo), and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients is called ‘‘relative variable ﬂuorescence’’, if plotted versus time revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band near to 2 ms, is an indication of the Q A concentration is increased [10]. VOJ is the relative variable ﬂuorescence between Fo and FJ and is calculated as VOJ (t) = FVt/(FJ Fo) = (Ft Fo)/(FJ Fo) and plotted versus time. If a K-band appeared near to 0.3 ms indicate a damaged in the water splitting system on thylakoids [10]. 2.8. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence measurements in spinach leaf discs Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence on discs from dark-adapted spinach leaf was measured with the same equipment and conditions used for thylakoids. Fifteen spinach leaf discs (7 mm diameter) were placed in each Petri dishes with 10 mL of modiﬁed Krebs solution which contained: 115 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM Na2SO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 25 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4), then were incubated for 4 h at room tempera- ture, after this time, different concentrations of compound was added to each Petri dish. The leaf discs were incubated for 4 h more in the presence of the compounds, then, they were dark adapted for 30 min and afterwards the ﬂuorescence of the chlorophyll a was measured. The same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used for the samples treated with the analyzed compounds was added to the control samples for eliminating the solvent effect. 2.9. Plant material for in vivo assays The seeds of Physalis ixocarpa and Lolium perenne, a weed spe- cies, were sown in 12 cm diameter pots and were watered daily in the greenhouse at 25–30 C. After 15 and 18 days of emergence for P. ixocarpa and L. perenne, respectively, the plants were selected for similar size and were sprayed manually with the compounds 1 and 2 at concentrations of 150 and 300 lM. A stock of 20 mM of each compound was prepared in DMSO and an aliquot of this solu- tion was taken to obtain the desired concentration in an aqueous suspension containing 0.05% w/v of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The control group was sprayed with dis- tilled water containing the same amount of DMSO and Tween-20. 2.10. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence determination in intact leaves in vivo This was performed at room temperature with a portable Handy PEA apparatus [11] in the leaves of dark adapted-plants for 15 min both on the control and on the treated plants after 24, 40 and 72 h of being sprayed with the compounds. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Inhibition of ATP synthesis To know the effect of the furoquinoline alkaloids 1–5 on photo- phosphorylation, they were assayed on freshly lysed spinach chlo- roplasts. ATP synthesis was inhibited by 1, 2, 4 and 5 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The I50 values for this activity were 83.5 and 59.0 lM for 1 and 2, respectively; 4 and 5 had the same value 50.5 lM and 3 was almost inactive and it was not further studied (Fig. 2). 3.2. Effect of the natural furoquinoline alkaloids on chloroplast electron transport rate The light-dependent photophosphorylation is coupled to elec- tron transport rate and can be inhibited by different ways: by blocking the electron transport, by direct inhibition of the H+-ATP- ase, or by uncoupling the ATP synthesis process from the electron transport [24]. To elucidate the mechanism of action of the furo- quinoline alkaloids on photosynthesis, their effects on non- cyclic electron transport (basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled) from water to MV were investigated. 38 T.A.M. Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 Furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited basal, phosphor- ylating, and uncoupled electron transport as their concentrations increased up to 200 lM. The I50 values for uncoupled electron transport rate were 21.0, 18.6, 23.4 and 22.8 lM, respectively (Table 2). Compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the electron ﬂow (in basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions) and ATP syn- thesis; therefore they act as Hill reaction inhibitors. Other natural products that act as Hill reaction inhibitors are the biﬂavonoid iso- lated from Seleginella lepydophylla, robustaﬂavone [25] or the fur- anoditerpene canophyllol isolated from Celastrus vulcanicola) [16]. 3.3. Localization of furoquinoline alkaloids interaction sites on the light reaction of photosystem PS II and photosystem PS I and partial reactions To localize the inhibition site of the alkaloids on the thylakoid electron transport chain, their effects on PS II, PS I and photosys- tems partial reactions were tested using artiﬁcial electron donors and acceptors, as well as appropriate inhibitors [21]. Table 3 shows that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the uncoupled PS II electron ﬂow from water to DCBQ; 1 inhibited PS II 100% at a concentration of 300 lM, however, alkaloids 2, 4 and 5 inhibited partially this activity (81%, 67% and 89%, respectively) at the same concentration (300 lM); therefore, 1 was the most active compound inhibiting the PS II electron transport. To further localize the inhibition site of the furoquinolines on the PS II electron transport chain, their effects were measured on the electron ﬂow from water to SiMo (SiMo ac- cepts electrons from pheophytin, so in this way the electron ﬂow measurements are from the water splitting enzyme to pheophy- tin). The results indicate that1, 2, 4 and 5 did not affect this partial reaction, since the rate of treated thylakoids were similar to the control (data not shown), therefore, all active furoquinoline alka- loids inhibited the electron transport chain beyond the pheophytin site [20]. The polarographic measurements suggest that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited electron transport between QA and QB of PS II, at the D1 protein by displacing QB, similar to how DCMU herbicide acts. The mechanism action of 1, 2, 4 and 5 is similar to other natural prod- ucts like trachyloban-19-oic acid [26], ﬂindersine [4]. Uncoupled PS I electron transport rate was measured by polar- ography from reduced DCPIP to MV by using increasing concentra- tions of the alkaloids tested, in order to ﬁnd if they affect this photosystem. The results of these studies showed that the rate for control and treated samples were similar, therefore the furo- quinoline alkaloids do not interact with PS I electron transport chain (data not shown). 3.4. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in thylakoids in the presence of the furoquinoline alkaloids To corroborate the polarography results about the interaction site of the furoquinoline alkaloids at PS II, ﬂuorescence of chloro- phyll a were measured on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts incu- bated for 5 min in the dark at room temperature. Control chloroplast contained the amount of DMSO used for each treat- ment, the treated chloroplasts contained various concentrations of the compounds (each concentration was measured three times); chloroplasts incubated with Tris and 10 lM DCMU were used as positive control (Fig. 3). Chlorophyll a induction curves of thylak- oids control (Fig. 3) showed an OJIP sequence similar to that previously described for plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria [27] except that phase IP was in part suppressed due to the effect of MV [28]. The chloroplasts inﬁltrated with DCMU and the control samples showed almost identical FM level (Table 4). However, the FM level of treated chloroplasts decreased respect to the control, while the Fo was not been affected by almost all the compounds tested; only 1 increased lightly the Fo level. The ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a transients were normalized, and the difference be- tween the treated and control normalized transients revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band (Fig. 4A). The ﬂuorescence rise to the J-band provides information Table 1 Derived parameters, their description and formulae using data extracted from the chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence (OJIP) transient presented in this paper.

Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 39 about single turnover events of the primary reactions of the photo- chemistry, mainly QA reduction, indicating that the electron trans- port beyond QA is blocked at the QB level as DCMU does, suggesting that 1 interacts at this site and the unused energy is dissipated as heat [10]. In Fig. 4A, a small H-band was observed after 100 ms and closer to 1000 ms, this band is due to the electron acceptor MV ef- fect [28]. In Fig. 4B, a K-band is observed in chloroplasts treated with Tris 0.8 M. Even though a small K-band is also observable in chloroplasts treated with DCMU, this band can be to the solvent ef- fect of the ethanol where the DCMU was dissolved [28], however, the furoquinoline alkaloids were dissolved in DMSO as solvent and it have not any effect on the ﬂuorescence induction curve. Furthermore, the Fm value in the presence of DCMU plus MV is similar to the control sample (Table 4). In chloroplasts treated with furoquinolines alkaloids plus MV decreased Fm and the parameters derived from the JIP test (see Table 1) had similar behavior with DCMU treatment (Fig. 5), with the parameter dR0 exception, [it reﬂects the efﬁciency with which an electron can move from the reduced electron acceptors coming of the intersystem to the PS I (reducing site)] [29]; this parameter was slightly increased by the furoquinoline treatments (with DCMU treatment it drastically diminished). Values like REo/CS, REo/RC and uRo decreased with all treatments, being more drastic for DCMU. These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electrons transport chain in two sites, one at donor and the other on the acceptor side in PS II (Fig. 5). The effect of furoquinoline alkaloids site at the donor side was detected only by the technique of ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a of PS II, and not by polarography technique [10]. 3.5. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in leaf discs To know if the alkaloids can reach their targets on the photo- synthesis electron transport chain, ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a induction curves were measured in discs obtained from fresh spinach leaves. In Fig. 6A the OJIP sequences for control and discs treated with the most active furoquinoline 1 (in this case MV was omitted from the medium) showed a rise in the J peak. In discs treated with 1, 2, and 5 at concentration of 400 lM, the differences between normalized curves and control showed a J-band (Fig. 6B). Furthermore 4 did not show any effect on the discs ﬂuorescence (data not shown). J-band for 1 was bigger than for 2 and 5 (Fig. 6B). Also 1 and 2 showed a small K-band while compound 5 lacks this band (Fig. 6C). When the transients were normalized between FM and F5, a band in the IP region ap- peared (30 ms to about 300 ms) for compounds 2 and 5 (Fig. 6D).

In addition, the quantum yield for the reduction of PSI end acceptors per photon absorbed also increased. These results suggest that end acceptors of PS I cannot be reduced because the electrons from PS II are not available. The parameters for 2 and 5 are similar to the con- trol (Fig. 7) indicating that these compounds do not reach com- pletely their target.

In vivo assays In order to conﬁrm if 1 can penetrate the intact whole leaf and affect the plants in vivo, this compound was sprayed on the leaves of L. perenne and P. ixocarpa plants after 15 days of growth in the green house. Studies of chlorophyll a Fluorescence were performed on the plants after 24, 48 and 72 h of being sprayed with 1 at 150 and 300 lM. The results showed non-signiﬁcant inhibiting growth effect. These results suggest that 1 does not overcome the natural barriers provided by the plants, since the chlorophyll a and dry bio- mass of these plants were not affected by 1 (data not shown). 4. Conclusions The results indicated that furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited ATP synthesis and electron transport in spinach chloro- plasts while 3 was inactive. The inhibition site of alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 was located at the acceptor side of PS II by polarographic technique. When these results were corroborated by chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II data; we found that the donor side of PSII is inhibited by these furoquinoline alkaloids. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence measurements on leaf discs treated with furoquinoline alka- loids showed changes in the induction curve of ﬂuorescence only with 1, transforming the OJIP trace at OJ step, showing a J band which indicates that only 1 can reach its inhibition target. However when 1 was sprayed on intact whole leaves, this compound could not penetrate the leaves plant natural barriers. Furthermore, 1 with two methoxy groups has the lowest molar volume unlike com- pounds 2, 4 and 5 with 3 methoxy groups and therefore larger mo- lar volumes which make more difﬁcult their translocation in the leaves. Also alkaloid 3 has a lower molar volume, but it has a LogP value of 2.70, similar to compounds 4 and 5. However, 1 has a high- er LogP value of 3.20 suggesting that this compound fulﬁlls the speciﬁc structure requirements for inhibiting PSII electron trans- port chain in leaf discs that the other furoquinoline alkaloids stud- ied lack these characteristics.

The largest number of conidia was obtained after 5 days of incubation in oat medium and the highest level of antimicrobial activity was produced when the fungus culture was developed in the Czapek medium. The activity against Staphylococcus aureus was found only in the chloroform extract from Czapek culture broth, which also showed activity against Micrococcus luteus. Fumiquinozoline F was isolated from the active chloroform extract by using chromatographic methods. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for M. luteus and S. aureus were 99 mg/ mL and 137 mg/mL, respectively. & 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved. Introduction Microorganisms have been traditionally used to produce a variety of important substances for the pharmaceutical and food industries. Hence, pri- mary and secondary metabolites, such as peptides, enzymes, organic acids and antibiotics produced by ﬁlamentous fungi are used for these purposes (Bennett, 1998; Demain, 2000). The discovery and development of antibiotics was one of the most signiﬁcant advances in medicine in the 20th century. Nevertheless, many antimicrobial agents that were used to treat a variety of human infectious diseases are now www.elsevier.de/micres KEYWORDS Fumiquinazoline F; Antibacterial activity; Penicillium corylophilum 0944-5013/$ - see front matter & 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

Therefore, to ensure that effective drugs will be available in the future, it is necessary to improve the antimicrobial use patterns and to devise strategies to identify new antibiotics through previously unexplored targets (Smith and Jarvis, 1999). Natural products play an important role in the discovery of leads for the development of drugs for the treatment of human diseases and microbial environment is an important source of novel active agents (Newman et al., 2003). Many of this products currently used are produced by microbial fermentation, or are derived from chemical mod- iﬁcation of a microbial product (Donadio et al., 2002). In this regard, the fermentation process is an important tool for production of secondary meta- bolites that can not be isolated from plants and animals, or synthesized by chemists because of the ease of increasing production by environmental and genetic manipulation (Demain, 2000). Several secondary metabolites have been identi- ﬁed from Penicillium corylophilum, as well as their biological activities. In this work, we determined the best procedure for the production and extrac- tion of antimicrobial metabolites from P. corylo- philum and an alkaloid derived from tryptophan with antimicrobial activity was isolated by using chromatographic methods. Material and methods Microorganisms: P. corylophilum was isolated from a soil sample collected in Sa˜o Carlos, state of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, and identiﬁed by ‘‘Fundac-a˜o Tropical de Pesquisas e Tecnologia Andre´ Toselo’’. The fungus is stored as a conidial suspension on silica gel (6–12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated) at 4 1C. The strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Pseudomo- nas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were acquired from the ATCC. Conidia production: Penicillium corylophilum was submitted to four different media: oat agar (Crotti et al., 1999), malt extract (Tzean et al., 1992), potato dextrose agar—PDA (Kim et al., 1990) and Vogel medium (Vogel, 1956). The cultures were incubated at 30 1C for 5 days. Conidia produced in each culture were harvested with 2% of Tween 80 and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. Production of secondary metabolites: The pro- duction was carried out by inoculating 4 106 con- idia/mL, obtained in oat medium, into the pre- fermentative medium (Jackson et al., 1993) at 30 1C with shaking (120 rev/min) for 24 h. The obtained mycelium mass was then inoculated into three different fermentative media: Czapek (Atlas, 1995), Jackson (Jackson et al., 1993) and Vogel (Vogel, 1956). Cultures were reincubated at 30 1C and 120 rev/min for an additional 144 h. For alkaloid production the fungus was grown in ﬁve Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 240 mL of pre-fermen- tative medium in each and was transferred to Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 480 mL of Czapek medium. Partition of the culture broth with organic solvents and isolation of the fumiquinazoline F from the chloroform extract: The culture broths were separated by ﬁltration, followed by three times partition with chloroform and buthanol in sequence. All the resulting organic solvents were evaporated under vacuum and the remaining water fractions of the culture broths were lyophilized. The crude chloroform extract from Czapek culture broth (3698 mg), the active one, was then sub- mitted to column chromatography over 400 g of silica gel 60 H (70–230 mesh, Merck) and eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate at increasing propor- tions. The 7th fraction eluted with ethyl acetate (1077 mg) was submitted to ﬂash chromatography (Still et al., 1978) over 11 g of silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh), which was eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of hexane-acetate 3:2. Afterwards, the fourth obtained fraction (576 mg) was sub- mitted to HPLC analysis. Instrumentations con- sisted of a Shimadzu (SCL-10Avp, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD- M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control and data collection and processing. Analytical chroma- tography was carried out using isocratic gradient (methanol/water/acetonitrile 11:1:8) in 25 min. A CLC-ODS (M)—4.6 250 mm2 Shimadzu column was used at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The spectral data from the detector were collected within 25 min over the 200–400 nm range of the absorption spectrum and the chromatograms were analyzed and plotted at 281 nm. The alkaloid was collected between 16.1 and 16.5 min. General experimental procedures: A Bruker DRX- 400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C was used. All spectra were run in CDCl3 with TMS as internal standard. For a HREIMS an Autospec-Micromass-EBE was used (Uni- versidade Estadual de Campinas, UNICAMP). Antimicrobial activity: The crude extracts were investigated for antimicrobial activity by using the agar diffusion method with Petri dish template system inoculated with the assayed microorgan- isms, followed by incubation at 37 1C for 24 h. For this procedure, aliquots of the extracts, free of M. Garcia Silva et al. 318 solvents, were solubilized (5.0 mg/mL) in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, v/v) aqueous solution and applied into the template holes made on the medium surface. Negative controls were run for DMSO aqueous solution, chloroform and buthanol. Streptomycin (77.7 U, 50 mL, Sigma) for Gram- negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa and E. coli), Penicillin G (0.6075 U, 50 mL, Sigma) for M. luteus and Penicillin G (1.215 U, 50 mL, Sigma) for S. aureus were used as the positive controls. The inoculum was prepared by culturing each organism in Antibiotic N11 agar medium (Merck) for 24 h at 37 1C. The microorganisms were transferred to 0.9% NaCl until they reached the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard. Each microorganism sus- pension (0.5%) was added in Antibiotic N11 agar medium, and distributed over the plates. The MIC values of the isolated alkaloid were evaluated in triplicate by microdilution broth method (Andrews, 2001). The alkaloid was solubilized in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) at 1 mg/mL, and was diluted in Tryptone soya broth in the range of 147.536.8 mg/mL. The inoculum was adjusted to each organism yielding a cell concentration of 103 colony forming units (CFU/mL). It was included both inoculated wells, that controls the adequacy of the broth to support the growth of the organisms and uninoculated wells, that remains free of antimicrobial agent to check the sterility of the medium. Penicillin G (Sigma) was used as positive control. The microplates (96-well) were incubated at 37 1C for 24 h. After that, 40 mL of 2,3,5- triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.7%) in aqueous solution were added to indicate the viability of microorganisms (Leverone et al., 1996). The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of drug able to totally inhibit microorganism growth. Results Determination of the best conditions for conidial production The largest number of conidia was obtained after 5 days of incubation in oat agar, Vogel, malt extract and PDA media, in this order (Fig. 1). Selection of fermentative medium for antimicrobial activity production Different fermentative media were investigated to determine in which broth the antimicrobial activity was produced. The highest level of antimicrobial activity was produced by P. corylophilum when the fungus culture was developed in the Czapek medium, as observed for the results obtained by the agar diffusion method (Table 1). The activity was considered for inhibition zones wider than 12 mm since the template punches holes of approximately 10–11 mm into the agar surface. The activity against S. aureus was found only in the chloroform extract from Czapek culture broth. Independently of the culture medium, the anti- microbial activity was detected only in the chloro- form extracts. Moreover, no extracts showed activity against Gram-negative bacteria at the concentration evaluated in this work.

The MS High Resolution showed the [M+] peak m/z 358.14298. The 13C NMR spectrum of the compound showed 21 carbon signals. The multiplicities of the carbons deter- mined by APT led to the attribution of: 8 C, 11 CH, 1 CH2 and 1 CH3. Among the quaternary carbons two were attributed to amide carbonyls (d 168.9, C-12 and 160.7, C-5). The 1H NMR spectrum showed two broad singlets at d 8.00 (1H, H-13) and d 5.83 (1H, H-16) indicating that these hydrogens could be attached to nitrogens. Hence, these data suggested an alkaloid type structure for the compound (Fig. 2). The 1H NMR spectrum also showed nine hydrogen signals between d 6.64 and 8.30. In the 1H–1H COSY experiment the signals at d 7.35 (dd, J ¼ 8:1 and 0.8 Hz, H-9), d 6.87 (ddd, J ¼ 8:1; 7.1 and 0.8 Hz, H- 10), d 7.06 (ddd, J ¼ 8:1; 7.1 and 0.8 Hz, H-11) d 7.23 (dd, J ¼ 8:1 and 0.8 Hz, H-12) were coupled to each other. The hydrogen at d 6.64 (d, J ¼ 2:5 Hz; H-14) was coupled to the hydrogen at d 8.00 (H-13). The chemical shifts of the carbons attached to these hydrogens were attributed according to the HMQC data (Table 2). These data allowed us to propose an indolic moiety for the compound, which was corroborated by the H-C correlations observed in the HMBC experiment. The HMBC experiment showed the correlation of the indolic carbon at d109:6 (C-8a) with the hydrogens at d 3.66 (dd, J ¼ 14:9 and 3.3 Hz, H-80) and d 3.59 (dd, J ¼ 14:9 and 5.3 Hz, H-800). In the HMQC experiment these hydrogens were attached to the carbon at d 27.0. The 1H–1H COSY experiment showed that these hydrogens (H-8) are coupled to each other and to another hydrogen at d 5.63 (dd, J ¼ 5:3 and 3.3 Hz, H-7). The HMBC experiment showed the correlation of both H-8 with C-7, C-8a and C-15. These data led us to propose an alkaloid derived from tryptophan for the isolated compound (Bergman and Bergman, 1985). The 1H–1H COSY experiment also revealed that the hydrogens at d 8.30 (ddd, J ¼ 8:1; 1.5 and 0.5 Hz, H-4), d 7.47 (ddd, J ¼ 8:1; 7.3 and 1.3 Hz, H-3), d 7.71 (ddd, J ¼ 8:3; 7.3 and 1.5 Hz, H-2) and d 7.53 (dd, J ¼ 8:3 and 1.5 Hz, H-1) were coupled to each other. The aromatic carbons chemical shifts were attributed on the basis of HMQC data. These spectral data suggested an anthranilic acid derivative moiety. It was corrobo- rated by the correlation of the carbon at d 160.7 (C-5) with H-4 (d 8.30). The remaining 1H NMR signals were observed at d 1.29 (d, J ¼ 6:6 Hz; 3 H, H-19) and d 2.99 (q, J ¼ Table 2. 13C (100 MHz) and 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectral data for fumiquinozoline F (CDCl3) Position C H 1 127.3 7.53 dd (8.3; 0.5) 2 134.6 7.71 ddd (8.3; 7.3; 1.5) 3 127.1 7.47 ddd (8.1; 7.3; 1.3) 4 126.9 8.30 ddd (8.1; 1.5; 0.5) 4a 120.3 — 5 160.7 — 6 — — 7 55.6 5.63 dd (5.3; 3.3) 8 27.0 3.66 dd (14.9; 3.3) 3.59 dd (14.9; 5.3) 8a 109.6 — 8b 127.2 — 9 118.6 7.35 dd (8.1; 0.8) 10 121.6 6.87 ddd (8.1; 7.1; 0.8) 11 122.6 7.06 ddd (8.1; 7.1; 0.8) 12 111.1 7.23 dd (8.1; 0.8) 12a 136.0 — 13 — 8.00 br s 14 123.4 6.64 d (2.5) 15 168.9 — 16 — 5.83 br s 17 49.1 2.99 q (6.6) 17a 151.6 — 18 — — 18a 147.1 — 19 19.3 1.29 d (6.6) N H N H N O N O 1 2 3 4 4a 5 6 8 8a 8b 9 10 11 12 12a 13 14 15 16 17 17a 18 18a 19 7 Figure 2. Structure of the fumiquinozoline F, isolated from Czapek chloroform extract. M. Garcia Silva et al. 320 6:6 Hz; 1 H, H-17), both coupled to each other as observed in the 1H–1H COSY experiment. The HMBC experiment showed the following correlations: H- 19 (d 1.29) correlated with a carbon at d 151.6 (C- 17a) and C-19 (d 19.3) correlated with H-16 (d 5.86). These data suggested an alanine moiety for the compound. Therefore, the data allowed to propose the structure of fumiquinozoline F as an alkaloid derived from the linking of the aminoacids tryptophan and alanine plus an anthranilic acid unit. Regarding the antimicrobial activity, the MIC values of this compound against M. luteus and S. aureus were of 99 mg/mL and 137 mg/mL, respec- tively. Nevertheless, the penicillin G standard was more active than the isolated compound for both microorganisms (0.011 mg/mL and 0.023 mg/mL, respectively). Discussion The expression of secondary metabolites might depend on the culture conditions and the strains. P. corylophilum is often isolated from temperate climates (Malmstro¨m et al., 2000), but in this work we investigated a strain isolated from Brazilian soil sample, a tropical country. According Gaden-Junior (2000), the metabolites production is inﬂuenced by medium composition, nutrients availability and others aspects. Different nitrogen and carbon sources may affect the synth- esis of enzymes involved in primary and secondary metabolism. Microorganisms are able to use a wide variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. Never- theless, many secondary metabolic pathways are negatively affected by these sources favorable for growth (Sanchez and Demain, 2002). In the study of the secondary metabolites of the P. corylophilum, Cutler et al. (1989) isolated the 3,7-dimethyl-8-hydroxy-6-metoxysocroman, from the mycelia using shredded wheat medium, which was maintained 12 days at 22 1C. By cultivation in malt medium, strains of P. corylophilum produced the alkaloid epoxyagroclavine I (Grabley et al., 1992). In this work, a two step culture was used for antimicrobial active compounds production. In the ﬁrst step, the microorganism was cultivated in pre- fermentative medium, which is rich in nutrients to increase vegetative biomass production. The har- vested mycelium was then transferred to fermen- tative medium for secondary metabolites production. The fumiquinazolina F was isolated from the chloroform extract of the Czapek fermen- tative medium, after 144 hours of incubation. From the three evaluated media, the Czapek one was the best for antimicrobial metabolites production. Fumiquinazoline F was originally obtained from a strain of Aspergillus fumigatus, which was isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of the marine ﬁsh Pseudolabrus japonicus (Takahashi et al., 1995), and it was also detected in Penicillium thymicola (Larsen et al., 1998). It was the ﬁrst time that Fumiquinazoline F was isolated from P. corylophi- lum. Besides, it is the ﬁrst time that the anti- microbial activity of this compound is been described. The fumiquinazolines belong to a class of compounds possessing a wide range of biological activities. For instance, fumiquinazolines A, B and C from A. fumigatus showed moderate cytotoxicity against the cultured P-388 lymphocytic cells (Nu- mata et al., 1992). Fumiquinazolines H and I, isolated from Acremonium sp. presented signiﬁcant antifungal activity (Snider and Zeng, 2003). Kariba et al. (2002), showed that extracts of Schizozygia coffaeoides, containing indolines pre- sented antifungal and antibacterial activities. The berberine, benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, isolated from Hydrastis canadensis, is active against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well against fungi and parasites (Scazzocchio et al., 2001). Fumiquinazoline F is derived of tryptophan, plus anthranilic acid and it showed value of MIC lower than berberine, canadaline and canadine for S. aureus (ATCC 25923) (Scazzocchio et al., 2001). The identiﬁcation of this class of alkaloid in cultures of P. corylophilum opens new possibilities for bioprospection of new compounds belonging to this class with potential for the design of new drugs.

Introduction Although Coussarea is considered to be only a small genus within the taxon Rubiaceae, it is well represented in the main Brazilian biomes including the Amazoˆnia and the Cerrado. Coussarea hydrangeifolia, commonly know as ‘‘falsa-quina’’, is characteristic of the vegetation of the Cerrado and of the semi-deciduous forests of Brazil, where it is considered to be a pioneer species (Cor- rea, 1974). In the course of our studies concerning the bioactive principles of Brazilian plants, with special emphasis on the vegetation of the State of Sa˜o Paulo (Pauletti et al., 2003; Hamerski et al., 2003), we found that the aqueous extract of the leaves of C. hydrangeifolia showed antioxidant activity, as determined by a prelimin- ary test with b-carotene, and strong free radical scaveng- ing activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH). Fractionation of this extract provided ﬁve phe- nylpropanoid glycosides including two new compounds, 1 and 2, which had their structures determined by spec- troscopic methods. 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated from the aqueous extract of C. hydrangeifolia as an amorphous powder with an ½a30 D of 44.3. A quasimolecular ion peak [M H] for 1 was observed at m/z 415.1610 in the high-resolu- tion electrospray ionisation mass spectrum (HRESIMS; negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula of C19H28O10. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorp- tion bands at 3430 and 1042 cm1 suggesting the pres- ence of hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed signals that could be attributed to a monosubstituted benzene ring [d 7.54 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-2,6), 7.30 (m, H-3,5), 7.23 (m, H-4)], a b-D-glucosyl moiety [d 4.90 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-10), 4.06 (dd, J = 7.5, 8.0 Hz, H-20), 4.19 (t like, J = 8.0 Hz, H-30), 4.12 (m, H-4), 4.20 (ddd, J = 9.5, 7.5, 2.5 Hz, H-50), 4.18 (dd, J = 11.0, 7.5 Hz, H 60 a), 4.64 (dd, J = 11.0, 2.5 Hz, H 60 b), and a rhamnosyl group [d 5.55 (d, J = 1.0 Hz, H-100), 4.62 (m, H-200), 4.55 (dd, J = 3.5, 9.0 Hz, H-300), 4.26 (t like, J = 9.0 Hz, H-400), 4.97 (m, H-5), 1.62 (d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-600). Additionally, the signals at d 4.85 (d, J = 11.5 Hz) and 5.15 (d, J = 11.5 Hz) could be as- cribed to benzylic oxymethylene hydrogens, thus cha- racterising the aromatic portion of 1 as a benzylic system. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed sig- nals at d 137.8, 128.2 (2·), 127.9 (2·), 127.2 and 70.9, which were consistent with the presence of a monosub- stituted benzylic ring. Two anomeric methine carbons at d 103.7 and 102.6, several hydroxymethines, one hydroxymethylene carbon at d 68.4 and one methyl group at d 18.7 resembled those of glucose and rham- nose, respectively, and clearly suggested that 1 possessed glucopyranosyl and rhamnopyranosyl units. Data from COSY and TOCSY experiments revealed the hydrogen sets belonging to the glucosyl and rhamnosyl moieties. The complete assignment of hydrogen and carbon sig- nals and the positions of the bonds of the sugar moieties in 1 were determined by an HMBC experiment which showed long-range correlations between H-60 and C-40 and the anomeric C-100, between H-100 and the methylene C-60, and between H-7 of the benzylic system and C-10 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data of hydrangeifolin I (1), hydrangeifolin II (2) and 1,6-di-O-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranose (3) in pyridine-d5 Position 1 2 3 d 1H d 13C d 1H d 13H d 1H d 13C 1 – 137.8 (s) – 126.6 (s) – 127.6 (s) 2 7.54 d (7.5) 128.2 (d) 7.53 d (2.0) 115.8 (d) 7.05 m 111.7 (d) 3 7.30 m 127.9 (d) – 147.0 (s) – 148.8 (s) 4 7.23 m 127.2 (d) – 148.7 (s) – 149.5 (s) 5 7.30 m 127.9 (d) 7.16 d (8.0) 116.7 (d) 6.80 m 116.2 (d) 6 7.54 d (7.5) 128.2 (d) 7.10 dd (2.0; 8.0) 122.2 (d) 6.99 m 124.1 (d) 7 4.85 d (11.5) 70.9 (t) 7.97 d (15.5) 145.5 (d) 6.64 d (16.0) 114.8 (d) 5.15 d (11.5) 8 6.56 d (15.5) 114.4 (d) 7.93 d (16.0) 147.4 (d) 9 – 165.3 (s) – 169.6 (s) 10 4.90 d (7.5) 103.7 (d) 6.20 d (8.0) 96.1 (d) 4.48 d (7.4) 104.3 (d) 20 4.06 dd (7.5) 75.1 (d) 4.27 t (9.0) 78.8 (d) 4.04 t (9.0) 74.4 (d) 30 4.19 t (8.0) 77.2 (d) 4.34 m 78.5 (d) 3.95 t (9.0) 76.9 (d) 40 4.12 m 71.9 (d) 4.36 m 71.1 (d) 3.93 t (9.0) 71.0 (d) 50 4.20 ddd (9.5, 7.5, 2.5) 78.5 (d) 4.08 m 79.5 (d) 4.10 m 77.5 (d) 60 4.18 dd (11.0, 7.5) 68.4 (t) 4.40 d (12.0) 62.3 (t) 4.29 m 66.5 (t) 4.64 d (11.0, 2.5) 4.60 d (12.0) 4.39 m 100 5.55 d (1.0) 102.6 (d) 5.90 d (3.5) 94.2 (d) – 127.5 (s) 200 4.62 m 72.3 (d) 4.20 dd (3.5; 9.0) 74.6 (d) 7.05 m 111.7 (d) 300 4.55 dd (3.5; 9.0) 72.8 (d) 4.08 m 72.7 (d) – 148.8 (s) 400 4.26 t (9.0) 74.1 (d) 4.75 t (9.0) 75.5 (d) – 149.4 (s) 500 4.97 m 69.8 (d) 4.54 dd (2.5; 11.5) 63.1 (t) 6.80 m 116.2 (d) 4.42 dd (5.5; 11.5) 600 1.62 d (6.0) 18.7 (d) 6.99 m 124.1 (d) 700 6.52 d (15.5) 114.7 (d) 800 7.87 d (15.5) 147.1 (d) 900 – 169.7 (s) 1000 5.35 d (7.5) 99.6 (d) 2000 4.29 t (8.5) 74.3 (d) 3000 4.14 t (8.5) 76.9 (d) 4000 4.25 t (8.5) 72.2 (d) 5000 4.03 ddd (2.5; 5.5; 9.0) 78.6 (d) 6000 4.39 d (11.5) 63.3 (t) 4.58 d (11.5) 1928 L. Hamerski et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 1927–1932 of the glucosyl moiety and C-2/C-6 of the aromatic system. Consequently, the structure of 1 was established to be 10-O-benzyl-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(100 ! 60)-b-D- glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin I. Compound 2 exhibited a quasimolecular ion peak [M H] at m/z 635.1828 in the HRESIMS (negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula C26H36O18. MS/MS analysis of the quasimolecular ion revealed a signiﬁcant fragment ion at m/z 502.1321 assigned to [M H deoxyhexose]. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) clearly showed the presence of three sugar moieties together with nine additional signals that could be attributed to the aglycone moiety. Data from the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the pres- ence of an (E)-caﬀeoyl system [1H, d 7.97 (d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-7), 6.56 (1H, d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-8), 7.53 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2), 7.16 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5), 7.10 (1H, dd, J = 2.0, 8.0 Hz, H-6)] together with three anomeric protons, two of which [5.35 (d, J = 7.5 Hz) and 6.20 (d, J = 8.0 Hz)] were as- signed to the two b-glucose units, and one [d 5.90 (d, J = 3.5 Hz)], to an a-xylose moiety. From the 13C NMR spectrum it could be established that the aro- matic unit was an ester of (E)-caﬀeic acid [d 165.3 (C-9), 145.5 (C-7), 114.4 (C-8), 126.6 (C-1), 115.8 (C- 2), 147.0 (C-3), 148.7 (C-4), 116.7 (C-5), 122.2 (C-6)]. Complete assignment of the protons in each sugar sys- tem was achieved by considering the 1D and 2D TOCSY, 1D and 2D NOESY, and the 1H–1H COSY spectra, while the carbons were assigned from HMQC and HMBC data. A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at d 5.35 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) revealed a set of coupled oxymethine protons (d 4.29, 4.14, 4.25 and 4.03) and a methylene proton (d 4.39). These data, when ana- lysed with the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum, led to the identiﬁcation of a b-D- glucosyl moiety. Its position at C-3 of the caﬀeic acid moiety was established unambiguously by HMBC cor- relations observed between the anomeric proton H-1000 at d 5.35 and C-3 (d 147.0), and from the proton at d 7.10 (H-6) to C-2 (d 115.8) and C-4 (d 148.7). A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at d 6.20 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz) showed a set of coupled oxymethine pro- tons (d 4.27, 4.34, 4.36 and 4.08) and oxymethylene protons (d 4.40 and 4.60). Analysis of the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum led to the identiﬁcation of an additional b-D-glucosyl moiety. From the HMBC correlation observed between the signals at d 6.20 (H-10) and d 165.3 [the carbonyl of the (E)-caﬀeoyl group], the site of esteriﬁcation with the (E)-caﬀeoyl acid unit was determined to be at C- 10 of the glucopyranosyl. The downﬁeld shift of C-20 (d 78.8) together with the upﬁeld shift of C-10 (d 96.1) of the b-glucopyranosyl unit also suggested that the a-xylopyranosyl unit was attached to C-20 of the glucopyranosyl moiety. The cross peak in the HMBC experiment between d 4.27 (t, J = 9.0 Hz, H-20) and d 75.5 (C-400), and the correlation in the NOESY experiment between the signals at d 4.27 (t, J = 9.0, H-20) and at d 4.75 (t, J = 9.0, H-400), conﬁrmed the (400 ! 20) linkage of the disaccharide moiety. Acid hydrolysis of 2 aﬀorded glucose and xylose, which were identiﬁed by TLC by comparison with authentic samples. Consequently, the structure of 2 was estab- lished as a-L-xylopyranosyl-(400 ! 20)-(3-O-b-D-gluco- pyranosyl)-10-O E-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin II (see Fig. 1). Compound 3 was identiﬁed as 1,6-di-O-caﬀeoyl-b-D- glucopyranose from physical and spectroscopic data (Akhmedov and Litvinenko, 1968). Although this com- pound was ﬁrst isolated from Scrophularia grossheimi (a traditional medicinal plant used in Russia for the treat- ment of jaundice, hepatitis and rheumatism), to the best of our knowledge its 13C NMR spectroscopic data re- main unreported. The assignment of the 13C NMR sig- nals of 3, based mainly on 1D and 2D NMR experiments, is provided in Table 1. Compounds 4 and 5 were identiﬁed as 1-O-(E)-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranose and 1-O-(E)-feruloyl-b-D-glucopyranose, respectively (Birkofer et al., 1961, 1969). Preliminary TLC autographic test using b-carotene as revealing agent (Silva et al., 2001) evidenced several anti- oxidant compounds in the aqueous extract from leaves of C. hydrangeifolia.

As shown on Table 2, compounds 3 and 4 exhibited strong antioxidant activities, comparable with that of caﬀeic acid, probably due to the presence of the 3,4-dihy- droxy (catechol) moiety in their structures. Compounds 2 and 5, which bear only one free hydroxy group, showed weak free radical scavenging activities towards DPPH and compound 1 was inactive. 3. Experimental 3.1. General IR and UV spectra were obtained using Perkin–El- mer model 1600 series FTIR and Lambda 14P UV/ VIS spectrometers, respectively. ES-MS were measured on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRESIMS on a VG Autospec (40 eV) spectrometer. 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (125 MHz) and 2D NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Inova model 500 spec- trometer. The NMR data were measured in pyridine- d5 or DMSO-d6 and chemical shifts are expressed in d (ppm) values with reference to TMS. Preparative HPLC was conducted using a Phenomenex Luna ODS column (250 · 21.20 mm i.d.; 10 lm) coupled to a Varian Prep- Star S0-1 pump with ﬂow rate of the mobile phase set at 10 mL/min; and a Varian ProStar 320 UV/VIS detec- tor set at 254 nm.

Plant material Leaves of C. hydrangeifolia were collected in Mogi- Guac¸u (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil) in December 1997 and identiﬁed and authenticated by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil). A vou- cher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sa˜o Paulo (number SP 167423). 3.3. Antioxidant assay The b-carotene test was performed on TLC plates according to a previously described method (Pratt and Miller, 1984;Silva et al., 2001). The stable radical DPPH was used for the determination of free radical scaveng- ing activity: a methanolic solution (200 lM, 2 mL) of DPPH was added to methanol (1 mL) containing an appropriate amount of each test compound in order to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 or 5 lM. Caﬀeic and p-coumaric acids were used as stan- dard positive controls, whilst a solution of DPPH (200 lM, 2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as blank. All samples were evaluated as triplicates (n = 3). Each reaction mixture was shaken thoroughly and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The amount of the reduced form of the radical (DPPH-H) generated in situ was determined from the measured de- crease in current (I) in the electrochemical cell of the ElCD (Son and Lewis, 2002). The area measured on each chromatogram was normalised and compared with that obtained for the blank. The radical scavenging activity of each sample was expressed in terms of IC50 (the concentration in lM of test compound required to produce a 50% decrease in I caused by the formation of DPPH-H) (Pauletti et al., 2003). 3.4. Extraction and isolation Dried and powdered leaves (2.70 kg) of C. hydrangei- folia were extracted with EtOH (3.0 L) for 24 h at room temperature, followed by solvent evaporation under re- duced pressure to yield the crude extract (65.80 g). This extract was suspended in water (3.0 L) and partitioned with n-BuOH (3.0 L): the aqueous solution was evapo- rated to dryness and the resulting residue (2.0 g) sub- jected to gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.0 · 120 cm) eluted with MeOH. Fractions (10 mL each) were collected and analysed by TLC (CHCl3/ MeOH 6:4). On the basis of their TLC proﬁles, fractions 6–10 were combined (380.8 mg) and further subjected to over Sephadex LH-20 CC with MeOH as eluent. Frac- tions 8–12 from this second column fractionation were combined (54.3 mg) on the basis of their TLC proﬁles and puriﬁed by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2 O (1:9) to yield 1 (12.0 mg; tR 12.54 min). Fractions 13–14 from the ﬁrst Sephadex column were combined (500 mg) and subjected to CC over C-18 eluted with a MeOH/H2O step gradient (in ratios 1:19, 3:17 and 3:2, successively) to yield fractions A, B and C. Fraction A (132.7 mg) was further puriﬁed by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (7:93) to yield 2 (35.8 mg: tR 10.25 min). Fraction B (67.5 mg) was subjected to HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (1:9) to yield, 3 (6.1 mg; tR 22.38 min) and 4 (16.9 mg; tR 14.64 min). Fraction C (145.9 mg) was puriﬁed under the same conditions and aﬀorded 5 (8.4 mg, tR 18.91 min). 3.4.1.

Introduction Endophytic fungi are organisms living within the tissues of hosts plants (Andrews and Hirano, 1991). These organ- isms are known as potential sources of biologically active secondary metabolites (Dreyfuss and Chapela, 1994; Tan and Zou, 2001; Strobel et al., 2004) and relatively little is known about the potential of these microorganisms from Brazilian endemic plant species (Azevedo et al., 2000, 2004). As part of our studies on bioactive agents from metabo- lites produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado, we initially selected 16 species of plants, which had already been phy- tochemically proﬁled by our group. Those species were submitted for isolation of endophytic fungi and 82 pure isolates were obtained, preserved, cultivated in liquid media and extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain crude extracts. Some metabolites produced by fungi were already published by our group (Teles et al., 2005; Cafeˆu et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005). The crude EtOAc extract of Phomopsis cassiae isolated from Cassia spectabilis showed moderate antifungal activ- ity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladospo- rium cladosporioides, stimulating further studies. Bioassay guided fractionation of this extract aﬀorded ﬁve new ses- quiterpenes (1–5). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular for- mula C15H22O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 273.1486). Their IR spectra revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm1) and phenolic groups (1466, 1690 cm1). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) showed two aromatic signals, one at d 6.87 (1H, s) and the other at d 6.43 (1H, s), sug- gesting a tetra-substituted aromatic spin-system with a para conﬁguration. A series of complex signals at d 3.76 (1H, m) 3.35 (4H, m); d 3.04 (1H, m) and d 2.30 (1H, m) were indicative of two carbinolic and two benzyl hydrogens, respectively. Further signals at d 0.51 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 1.03 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 2.05 (3H, s) revealed the presence of two aliphatic and one aromatic methyl groups in the molecule. The 13C NMR chemical shifts for 1 along with the infor- mation obtained from a DEPT-135 experiment (Table 1), indicated a total of 15 signals, suggesting a sesquiterpene: six aromatic carbons at d 152.9 (s), 141.1 (s), 128.1 (d), 127.4 (s), 121.9 (s) and 114.7 (d), conﬁrming the tetra-sub- stitution for the aromatic moiety and the para hydrogen system; two carbinolic signals: a methine at d 67.8 and a methylene at d 64.4; three signals for methines at d 40.1, 38.4 and 36.5; one aliphatic methylene at d 24.6 and three signals for methyl groups: d 16.7, 15.9 and 10.8. The above data suggested a cadinane skeleton (Zhang et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 1996). The total attribution for the observed signals was accomplished based on gHMQC correlations. Additional gHMBC correlations of H-5 (d 6.87) with C- 15 and C-7 (d 15.9 and d 36.5, respectively) and H-2 (d 6.43) with C-10 and C-4 (d 40.1 and d 121.9) allowed us to fully determine the aromatic moiety. The phenolic func- tion linked at C-3, was supported by the correlations between H-15 (d 2.05) and C-3/C-5 (d 152.9 and d 128.1, respectively). The linkage of the p-menthane moiety was determined through the correlations shown by C-1 (d 141.1) with H-14/H-9 (d 1.03/d 3.76) and C-6 (d 127.4) with, H-11/H-8b (d 2.70/d 1.52). Observed correlations between C-12 ! H-7 (d 64.4/3.04) and H-13 ! C-7 (d 0.51/36.5) allowed us to fully determine the calamenene skeleton (Nagashima et al., 1996). gNOESY was useful to establish the relative conﬁgura- tion of the stereocenters for 1. A correlations between Me-14 and Me-13 conﬁrmed a cis-calamenene, according to reported literature (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993). Further observed corre- lations between H-9a and H-7 allowed us to conﬁrm a (cis)-1,3-pseudo-diaxial relationship between these centers (Nabeta et al., 1993). We were not able to determine the conﬁguration of the stereocenter at C-11, due to free rotation of this center with C-7–C-11 bond. Compound 1 was thus identiﬁed as the rel. ()-(7S,9S,10S)-3,9,12- trihydroxycalamenene. Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H22O3 ([M + HH2O]+) at m/z 233.1542. The obtained mass and similarities observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) indicated that 2 was a diastereoisomer of 1. The main spectroscopic diﬀerences observed for this molecule were elucidated by using gNOESY. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 indicated that both groups remained in a cis conformation. The appearance of a strong correlation of Me-14 and H-9 indicated that H-7 and H-9 were in a trans conformation.

Assignments were aided by 1H–1H gCOSY and gHMQC. G.H. Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 1964–1969 1965 et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993) allowed us to provisionally deduce identify 2 as rel. (+)-(7S,9R,10S) the C-9 diastereo- isomer of 1. Compound 3 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. HRESI mass data allowed us to propose the molecular formula C15H22O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 235.1777). The absence of an oxygen atom in this molecule allowed us to provisionally deduce that a reduction occurred at position C-9. This reduction was conﬁrmed by 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) due to the presence of the signal at d 28.5 and the lack of the carboxymethine signal at d 67.8/69.1 present in 1 and 2, respectively. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 was observed in the gNOESY experiment thus concluding that 3 has a cis calamenene relative stereochemistry. Observed correla- tions between H-9a and H-8a and H-7 deﬁned their relative conﬁguration also as cis. Further observed correlations between H-8b and H-9b, conﬁrmed the relative conﬁgura- tion established for the p-menthane moiety. Compound 3 was hence identiﬁed as the rel. (+)-(7S,10S) 3,12- dihydroxycalamenene. Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. A molecular formula C15H18O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 231.1405) was obtained after HRESI mass data analysis. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed a new aromatic hydrogen spin system at d 7.03 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) and d 6.93 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) with an ortho conﬁguration. The downﬁeld shift observed for Me-14 (Dd +1.3) was indic- ative of an aromatization of the p-menthane moiety (Nab- eta et al., 1994). 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) data showed 10 aromatic carbons, three methyls: two benzylic and one aliphatic; one carboxymethylene and one benzylic methine, indicative of the presence of a naphthalene skele- ton. All correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and compared with reported data for cadalene analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Further correlations observed in the gHMBC experi- ment, particularly the ones of H-8 (d 6.93) with C-6/C-11 and H-9 (d 7.03) with C-1/C-14 allowed us to fully deter- mine the substitution pattern of the B ring for the naphtha- lene moiety. Compound 4 was identiﬁed as 3,12- dihydroxycadalene. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H18O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 269.1179). The appearance of a hydroxyl group in 5 was corroborated by the loss of the signal assigned to H-11 (d 3.59) in 4 thus suggesting that oxidation had occurred at this position. 13C NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopic data corroborated this assump- tion showing a signal at d 75.3 (s) which exhibited a corre- lation showed in the gHMBC experiment with H-8 (d 7.21) indicating that the new oxidized position was at C-11. Other correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, and compared with reported data for analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Compound 5 was identiﬁed as the new 3,11,12- trihydroxycadalene. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–5 against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaero- spermum was evaluated by bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). The compound 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (2) exhibited potent activity against two fungi. The detection limit for the compound 5 was found to be 1.0 lg, compara- ble with the same amount of the standard nystatin. Cytotoxicity of the compounds 1–5 against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983). Compound 4 exhibited HO H3C CH3 OH CH3 HO H3C CH3 OH CH3 HO H3C CH3 CH3 HO H3C CH3 CH3 HO H3C CH3 CH3 OH HO HO HO HO HO 1 2 3 4 5 10 7 6 3 12 13 4 1 11 14 15 1966 G.H.

Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC50 5 lmol L1. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure Optical rotations were determined at room temperature using Perkin–Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin–Elmer 1710 spectrometer and Perkin–Elmer UV–Vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on Microquimica MQAPF-301. 1H and 13C NMR spectra; gHMBC and gHMQC, gCOSY and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive and nega- tive ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-reso- lution orthogonal time of ﬂight (o-TOF) conﬁguration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 ll/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH–H2O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using a ESI capil- lary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/ MS spectra of mass selected ions were acquired using 10– 20 eV collisions with argon. For preparative HPLC separa- tions, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, and a Phe- nyl-hexyl Luna Phenomenex column, (250 · 21.20 mm, 5 lm), were used in this study. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromato-integrator connected to a UV detector. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisal- dehyde 5% in H2SO4 followed by heating. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated C. spectabilis plant material was collected in the Chemistry Institute UNESP – Araraquara, SP, Bra- zil in June 17, 2001 by G.H. Silva. The botanical identiﬁca- tion was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SILVA – 193). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus The fungal strain P. cassiae was an endophyte isolated from leaves of C. spectabilis. The leaves were washed in running H2O and surface sterilized by successive soaking in NaOCl 1% for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 1 min and then rinsed twice with water. Aseptically the leaves were cut open and 1 · 1 cm2 pieces of the leaves were placed on water agar in Petri plates. After incubation at 25 C for seven days, individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maier et al., 1997). During the ﬁrst three weeks of incubation, the cultures were periodically checked for purity and successively subcultured by hyphal tipping method until pure culture was obtained. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar. The taxonomic iden- tiﬁcation as P. cassiae was performed based on fungal morphology by Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited Cole- c¸a˜o Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lav- ras fungal herbarium and assigned as CML 292. 3.4. Growth of P. cassiae and production of the EtOAc extract The fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlen- meyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 C for 15 min. Approxi- mately 10 small pieces (1 · 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the P. cassiae isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration. The culture broth was extracted with EtOAc (3 · 2,0 L). The EtOAc extracts were combined, ﬁltered, and evaporated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (277.12 mg). 3.5. Antifungal assay The microorganisms C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Com- pounds 1–5 were applied on a precoated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 lL) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 lg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control. 3.6. Cytotoxicity bioassays The human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described (Mosmann, 1983). Cisplatin was used as positive control (IC50 5.0 lmol L1). 3.7. Extraction and isolation The extract was subjected to C18 column chromatogra- phy employing gradient elution from H2O to MeOH, to yield 7 fractions (H2O:MeOH, 85:15, 65:35, 60:40, 55:45, 45:55, 35:65, 00:100 each 150 mL). 1H NMR spectro- scopic analyses identiﬁed fractions 3, 4 and 5 as promising G.H. Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 1964–1969 1967 for further fractionation. The fraction 3 (23.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 · 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (19:81) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpene 1 (3.5 mg). Fraction 4 (15.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 · 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (22:78) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/ min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpenes 2 (2.5 mg) and 4 (4.0 mg). Fraction 5 (30.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phe- nomenex 21.20 · 250 mm] using CH3CN:H2O (29:71) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpenes 3 (4.0 mg) and 5 (4.8 mg). 3.7.1.

Their chemical structures were assigned based on analyses of MS, 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopic experiments. Biological analyses were performed using two mammalian cell lines, human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO). The results showed that compound 1 had no eﬀect when compared to the control group, which was treated with the vehicle (DMSO). Compound 2 was able to induce a slight increase in cell proliferation of HeLa (37% of increase) and CHO (38% of increase) cell lines. Analysis of compound 3 showed that it has potent cytotoxic activity against both cell lines, with an IC50 of 8.0 lM. Biological analyses using the phytopathogenic fungi Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides revealed that also 2 showed potent antifungal activity compared to nystatin. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction This study was conducted as part of our ongoing biopro- specting program Biota-FAPESP, that aims to discover potential antitumor, antifungal and antioxidant agents pro- duced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado. Among sixty screened fungi, Periconia atropurpurea, isolated from the leaves of Xylopia aromatica, was chosen for detailed chemical inves- tigation due to its antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides, i.e. as demon- strated by the ethyl acetate extract which in turn led to isolation of two new compounds: 6,8-dimethoxy-3-(20- oxo-propyl)-coumarin (1) and 2,4-dihydroxy-6-[(10E,30E)- penta-10,30-dienyl]-benzaldehyde (2), as well as the known compound periconicin B (3) (Kin et al., 2004). In this paper, we report the isolation, structure elucidation and biological evaluation of compounds 1–3 using two mammalian cell lines, human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), as well as two phytopathogenic fungi, Clad- osporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides. 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion The known compound periconicin B (3) was identiﬁed by comparing its physical and spectroscopic data with liter- ature values (Kin et al., 2004). It was described for the ﬁrst time from the fungus Periconia sp., and has not been reported from any another fungal source. The new compound 6,8-dimethoxy-3-(20-oxo-propyl)- coumarin (1), was obtained as a brown amorphous powder and had a molecular formula of C14H14O5, as revealed by analysis of the positive ion HRESI-MS data. The UV spec- tra showed four bands at 215, 231 (sh), 249 (sh) and 287 nm, with the latter being typical of an aromatic chro- mophore. The IR spectrum had bands at 1740 and 1630 cm1, suggesting conjugated carboxyl and carbonyl groups, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1, two methoxy moieties were identiﬁed by observation of signals at d 3.80 (3H, s, 6-OCH3) and d 3.89 (3H, s, 8- OCH3). A spin-system corresponding to a 1,2,3,5-tetrasub- stituted benzene ring was also assigned on the basis of the signals at d 6.76 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-5) and d 6.86 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-7). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum dis- played an isolated oleﬁnic hydrogen signal at d 7.80 (1H, s, H-4) and resonances at d 3.68 (2H, s, H-10) and d 2.19 (3H, s, H-30) attributable to a 20-oxo-propyl group. These data were consistent with the corresponding 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) and with similar information from analogues published in the literature (Dittmer et al., 2005), which suggested that 1 could possess a coumarin skeleton. This was inferred by signals at d 142.1 (C-4), d 100.0 (C-5), d 102.9 (C-7) and d 119.6 (C-10) observed in the 13C NMR spectrum, and additional resonances at d 161.0 (C-2), d 125.0 (C-3), d 156.0 (C-6), d 147.0 (C-8) and d 139.0 (C-9) observed in the gHMBC spectrum. In addition, two signals at d 55.7 (6-OCH3) and d 56.5 (8- OCH3), and three at d 44.2 (C-10), d 205.0 (C-20) and d 29.6 (C-30) were observed and attributable to methoxy and oxo-propyl groups, respectively. Data from the gHMBC and NOESY experiments (Table 1) supported these conclusions and enabled completion of the structure of 1. Correlations of the H-10 protons with oleﬁn (C-4) and carboxyl (C-2) carbons supported the location of a 20-oxo-propyl group at C-3. NOESY experiments were conducted on all hydrogens of 1 and showed a NOE corre- lation between 6-OCH3/H-5, H-5/H-4, H-4/H-10, H-10/H- 30 and H-7/8-OCH3 thereby conﬁrming unambiguously Table 1 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectroscopic data for compounds 1(1H, DMSO-d6; 13C, CDCl3 + CD3OD)a and 2 (DMSO-d6)a Position 1 2 1H (d) 13C (d) gHMBC NOESY 1H (d) 13C (d) gHMBC NOESY 1 111.2 2 161.0 b 165.3 3 125.0b 6.18 d (2.5) 101.4 C-1, C-2, C-4 – 4 7.80 s 142.1 C-9 H-5, H-10 165.1 5 6.76 d (2.5) 100.0 – H-4, 6-OCH3 6.49 d (2.5) 105.8 C-3, C-4, C-6, C-10 H-20 6 156.0b 143.7 7 6.87 d (2.5) 102.9 C-9 8-OCH3 8 147.0b 9 139.0b 10 119.6 10 3.68 s 44.2 C-20, C-2, C-4 H-4, H-30 7.16 d (15.5) 124.8 C-5, C-6, C-30 1-COH, H-30 20 205.0b 6.71 dd (10.5, 15.5) 134.0 C-6, C-40 H-5, H-40 30 2.19 s 29.6 C-20 H-10 6.27 ddd (0.5, 10.5, 15.0) 131.7 – – 40 5.95 dq (6.5, 15,0) 132.3 C-20, C-50 H-20, H-50 50 1.80 dd (0.5, 6.5) 18.1 C-30 H-40 1-COH 10.10 s 192.3 C-1, C-2, C-6 H-10 6-OCH3 3.80 s 55.7 C-6 H-5 8-OCH3 3.89 s 56.5 C-8 H-7 a Chemical shifts (relative to TMS) are in (d) ppm, coupling constants in Hz in parentheses.

Teles et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 2686–2690 2687 the positions of the methoxy and oxo-propyl groups (Fig. 1). 2,4-Dihydroxy-6-[(10E,30E)-penta-10,30-dienyl]-benzalde- hyde (2) was obtained as a colorless amorphous powder and was assigned the molecular formula of C12H12O3, via analysis of the negative ion HRESI-MS. The UV spectra showed bands at 261, 294 and 339 nm, assuring the pres- ence of an aromatic ring. The IR spectrum had bands at 3470 and 1629 cm1 accounting for the aromatic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 displayed a signal at d 10.10 (1H, s, 1-COH) attributable to an aldehyde group. The spin-system corre- sponding to a tetra-substituted benzene ring was identical to that obtained for 1 and was observed at d 6.18 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-3) and d 6.49 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz, H-5). The spectrum also displayed four resonances at d 7.16 (1H, d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-10), d 6.71 (1H, dd, J = 10.5, 15.5 Hz, H- 20), d 6,27 (1H, ddd, J = 0.5, 10.5, 15.0 Hz, H-30) and d 5.95 (1H, dq, J = 6.5, 15.0 Hz, H-40) attributable to oleﬁnic hydrogens in an S-trans arrangement, suggesting the pres- ence of a conjugated diene with a trans/trans conﬁguration (E/E). In addition, a signal at d 1.80 (3H, dd, J = 0.5, 6.5 Hz, H-50) was attributable to a vinyl methyl moiety in a vicinal coupling with H-40 and allylic coupling with H- 30. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals (Table 1), including one for the aldehyde group at d 192.3 (1-COH). The penta-10,30-dienyl moiety was conﬁrmed by assignment of the carbon resonances at d 124.8 (C-10), d 134.0 (C-20), d 131.7 (C-30), d 132.3 (C-40) and d 18.1 (C-50), these being substantiated by the gHMQC correlations observed. Data from the gHMBC experiment (Table 1) also supported these conclusions. Correlation of the 1-COH hydrogen with C-2 and C-6, and between H-20/C-6 and H-5/C-10 conﬁrmed the linkage of the aldehyde at C-1 and of the penta-dienyl unit at C-6, respectively. 1D-TOCSY experi- ments, showed a complete set of sequence correlations for the penta-dienyl unit. 1D-NOE experiments were also conducted showing NOE between 1-COH/H-10, H-10/H- 30, H-5/H-20, H-20/H-40 and H-40/H-50 corroborating the E/E suggested arrangement (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of an endophytic fungus from Xylopia aromatica (Annonaceae) and the ﬁrst isola- tion of this class of compounds from P. atropurpurea. Compounds 1–3 were evaluated against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides using direct bioau- tography (Rahalison et al., 1991). Only compound 2 exhib- ited strong antifungal activity against both fungi, showing a detection limit of 1.0 lg, comparable to nystatin (used as a positive control). Compound 1 did not show any anti- fungal activity, and 3 showed a relatively weak detection limit of 25.0 lg. Compounds 1–3 were also evaluated for cytotoxicity using HeLa and CHO mammalian cell lines. Compound 1 showed no activity to either cell lines, when compared to the vehicle-treated cells. Compound 2 was able to induce proliferation of HeLa cells (maximum of 37% of increased proliferation at 2.0 lM) and CHO cells (maximum of 38% of increased proliferation at 20.0 lM). Results obtained with compound 3 showed that it is a potent cytotoxic agent against the two mammalian cell lines analyzed. Compound 3 decreased cell viability of HeLa and CHO cells, with an IC50 of 8.0 lM, showing potency similar to that of cis- platin, a well known antineoplastic agent (IC50 5.0 lM), which was used as a cytotoxic positive control. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure UV spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer UV–Vis Lambda-14P spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Impact-400 spectrophotometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded using a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, with TMS as an internal standard. HRESI mass spectra were obtained using a Bruker Daltonics (UltroTOF-Q) mass spectrometer. Analytical HPLC was performed with a Var- ian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm · 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230–400 mesh and normal-phase silica gel G60 (Merck). TLC was per- formed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and pre- coated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anis- aldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm · 21.2 mm) preparative column. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated Xylopia aromatica (Lamarck) Martius plant material was collected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Experimental de Araraquara’’, Araraquara, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in 2001. The botanical identiﬁcation was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was depos- ited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SP 142.360). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus For isolation of the endophytic fungus, adult and healthy leaves were selected and subjected to surface steril- ization. They were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, and then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solu- tion for 5 min and aqueous ethanol (3:7, %) for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 cm2 pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dex- trose-agar) and gentamicin sulfate (0.5 mg/ml) with approximately 3–4 pieces on each dish. The material was incubated at 25 C for 10 days and the endophyte P. atro- 2688 H.L. Teles et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 2686–2690 purpurea was isolated by replication and preserved in sterile water (Maier et al., 1997). The fungus was identiﬁed by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning using rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and deposited in the (Colec¸a˜o Micolog- ica de Lavras, at the Universidade Federal de Lavras fun- gal herbarium with the accession number CML 631). 3.4. Growth and production of the crude extract The fungus was cultivated using three diﬀerent culture media: PDB (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/1.0 l H2O), Czapek (30.0 g saccharose; 3.0 g NaNO3; 1.0 g K2PO4; 0.5 g MgSO4; 0.5 g KCl; 0.01 g Fe2(SO4)3/1.0 l H2O) and Czapek + polystyrene resin XAD-2. For the ﬁrst medium, were used 2 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (500 ml), each con- taining 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 ml distilled water which were autoclaved at 125 C for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA (potato extract, dextrose and agar) medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of the P. atropurpurea isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 · 200 ml). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase in vacuo yielded a brown solid residue (129 mg). The above process was scaled up (4.0 l of PDB in 20 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) after the antifungal bioactivity against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was detected, aﬀording 1.44 g of EtOAc extract (A). For the other two culture media the process described was directly scaled up, using 5.0 l of Czapek med- ium [aﬀording 200 mg of EtOAc extract (B)] and 1.0 l of Czapeck + 50.0 g of XAD-2. After incubation, the resin XAD-2 was separated from medium by ﬂotation and extracted with MeOH aﬀording 700 mg of MeOH extract (C). 3.5. Antifungal assay C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sph- aerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay, and were maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds 1–3 were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using solution (10 ll) contain- ing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.0 and 1.0 lg. After eluting with CHCl3–CH3OH (9:1), they were sprayed with spore sus- pensions of the fungi (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). Nystatin was employed as positive control. 3.6. Biological assays using mammalian cell lines Biological assays aiming to determine cell viability after treatment with the compounds were performed as described previously (Teles et al., 2005). Brieﬂy, HeLa and CHO cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc., Gai- thersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). A stock solution (20.0 mM) was prepared by dissolving compounds 1–3 in DMSO (vehicle). The ﬁnal concentrations (200.0, 20.0 and 2.0 lM) were achieved by direct dilution into the cell medium. The compound 3 was also diluted in the following concentrations: 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 50.0 lM. After addition of the compound or the vehicle, cells (104 cells/well plated 24 h before) were analyzed after a period of 48 h using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983; Rubinstein et al., 1990). 3.7. Extraction and isolation EtOAc extract A (1.44 g) was fractionated by CC using silica gel and eluted with a CHCl3–MeOH gradient (95:5 ! 100% MeOH) aﬀording 15 fractions. Fraction 01 (290 mg) was fractionated by CC using Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4, 200 ml); CH2Cl2-ace- tone (3:2, 200 ml), CH2Cl2-acetone (1:4, 200 ml), acetone (150 ml) and MeOH (150 ml), aﬀording six sub-fractions. Sub-fraction 01 (11 mg) was further puriﬁed using reversed-phase prep. HPLC [k = 235 nm, 10.0 ml/min, CH3CN–H2O (9:1)] aﬀording 1 (2.8 mg, Rt = 17 min). EtOAc extract B (200 mg) was fractionated by CC using reversed-phase silica gel and eluted with a MeOH–H2O gradient (25:75 ! 100% MeOH) aﬀording four fractions. Fraction 4 (80.5 mg) was puriﬁed by HPLC using phe- nyl–hexyl phase in preparative column [k = 220 nm, 15.0 ml/min, MeOH–H2O (6:4)] aﬀording 3 (16 mg, Rt = 20 min). The MeOH extract C (700 mg) was fraction- ated by CC using reversed-phase silica gel and eluted with a MeOH-H2O gradient (20:80 ! 100% MeOH) aﬀording 05 fractions. Fractions 4 (160 mg) and 3 (41 mg) were puriﬁed by HPLC using a phenyl–hexyl phase preparative column and using the following chromatographic conditions: [k = 225 nm, 15.0 ml/min, MeOH–H2O (63:37)] and [k = 233 nm, 15.0 ml/ min, MeOH–H2O (50:50)], aﬀording 2 (20.0 mg, Rt = 22 min) and an additional sample of com- pound 1 (6.4 mg, Rt = 20 min), respectively. 3.7.1. 6,8-Dimethoxy-3-(20-oxo-propyl)-coumarin (1) Brown amorphous powder.

The structures of all compounds were elucidated primarily from 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All ﬂavonols were screened to identify secondary metabolites as potential myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitors, and at concentrations of 0.50–50 nM, quer- cetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) exhibited strong inhibitory eﬀects with IC50 values of 1.22 ± 0.01, 3.75 ± 0.02 and 3.60 ± 0.02, respectively. The MPO activity detected for the new derivative 1 was markedly decreased (IC50 10.3 ± 0.03) when compared with known ﬂavonols 5–7, and interestingly increased when tested against ABTS scavenging activity. 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Keywords: Pterogyne nitens; Fabaceae; Acylated ﬂavonol; Myeloperoxidase; Antioxidant 1. Introduction Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-enzyme present in human neutrophils and plays a role in infection and inﬂam- mation, converting hydrogen peroxide and chloride to hypochlorous acid and water (Winterbourn et al., 2000). Although hypochlorous acid has important roles in killing microorganisms, it also possesses high reactivity and the ability to damage macromolecules by oxidation (Teixeira et al., 2003). The excessive MPO activity and reactive oxy- gen species (ROS), especially HOCl, production are impli- cated in many inﬂammatory processes (Heinecke et al., 1993; Gurel et al., 2004), including atherosclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease; the search for new myeloperoxi- dase inhibitors from natural sources has become a staple in drug discovery. Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae) is popularly named in Bra- zil as ‘‘tipa´”, ‘‘viraro´”, ‘‘cocal”, ‘‘amendoinzeiro”, ‘‘amen- doim-bravo”, according to the region where this plant grows. It is a beautiful legume tree, and the sole member of the genus Pterogyne, which is distributed mainly in Bra- zil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, and can reach a height of 5–12 m. (Burkart, 1952). Its wood is also widely 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.01.006 * Corresponding author. Tel.: +55 16 33016660; fax: +55 16 33227932.

Our previous studies on P. nitens have resulted in the isolation of ﬂavones, and ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited selective activity towards a DNA repair-deﬁcient strain of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting poten- tial anti-cancer activity (Bolzani et al., 1995). In our contin- uing interest in searching for new biologically active metabolites from plants of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest regions, we have investigated the fruits of this plant, col- lected at the Botanical Garden, Sa˜o Paulo, in May 2003. We report herein the isolation, and structural elucidation of one new ﬂavonol rhamnoside, namely pterogynoside (1) and six known ﬂavonols: kaempferol (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (Pizzolat- ti et al., 2003), quercetin, isoquercitrin and rutin (Markham et al., 1978). Additionally, these compounds were screened for MPO inhibitory activity, using a guaiacol oxidation method (Capeille`re-Blandin, 1998). The new ﬂavonol 1 was also analyzed for the scavenging of DPPH and ABTS free radicals activities and its antioxidant potential was evaluated (see Fig. 1). 2. Results and discussion Shade-dried, powdered fruits of P. nitens were ﬁrst defatted with n-hexane and exhaustively extracted by re- maceration with ethanol. The solvent was evaporated at low temperature under reduced pressure to yield a syrup which was suspended in methanol–water (4:1) and then successively partitioned with ethyl acetate and n-butyl alco- hol. The resulting fractions were subjected to successive column chromatography separation steps to yield ptero- gynoside (1) along with six known ﬂavonols. Pterogynoside (1) was isolated as yellow prisms, m.p. 272–273 C, and gave a positive reaction with ferric chlo- ride, indicating it as a phenol derivative. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydro- xyl (3280 cm1), chelated hydroxy group (3265 cm1), con- jugated ester (1695 cm1), conjugated ketone (1650 cm1) and aromatic C@C absorptions (1612, 1593, 1550 and 1508 cm1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions (kmax) (loge) at 316 (4.53) and 297 (4.29), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a ﬂavonol struc- ture (Mabry et al., 1970; Agrawal et al., 1989). The UV spectra recorded in EtOH and shift reagents such as KOH, NaOAc and AlCl3 suggested the presence of free hydroxy groups at C-40, C-7 and C-5, respectively. Its ele- mental composition C29H26O14, with 17 of unsaturation, was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deproto- nated molecular ion ([MH]) at m/z 597.5087 (calcd for C29H26O14, 597.5081) consistent with its 13C NMR data (Table 1, Supporting Information). The CID (collision induced dissociation) experiments using the product ion scan mode (MS2) allowed characterization and establish- ment of the fragmentation pathway of pterogynoside, with an intense (64%) kaempferol peak at m/z 285 in the nega- tive ion mode. The positive ion mode also gave an intense kaempferol peak at m/z 287. Further MS analysis showed a deprotonated ion peak at m/z 597, and a product ion at m/z 431 indicating the presence of one hexose residue in com- pound 1.

Regasini et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 1739–1744 denced the presence of a 5,7,400- trisubstituted ﬂavonol moi- ety, in addition to 4000-methylgallate and a-L-rhamnopyr- anosyl residues. The assignment of all proton and carbon signals followed from extensive analysis of 1H–1H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC spectra (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 presented 29 carbons deduced from DEPT 90, DEPT 135 and gHMQC techniques as one methyl, thirteen methines, one methoxyl and fourteen quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 167.7 and d 179.5, attributed to ester and ketone groups, respectively. The 1H NMR and 1H–1H gCOSY spectra (Table 1) showed an A2M2 spin system assigned to the hydrogen sig- nals at d 7.74 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-200, 60) and 6.87 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-30, 50) attributed to a 1,4-disubstituted aro- matic ring; and a pair of doublets at d 6.10 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6) and 6.29 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-8) for the trioxygenated A ring of compound 1, suggesting a kaempferol moiety for its aglycone. Additionally, the 1H NMR resonances at d 5.38 and 0.89 evidenced an a- rhamnopyranosyl moiety, which was conﬁrmed by obser- vation of correlated signals at d 103.6, d and d 17.7 in the HMQC spectrum. A cross-peak between the signals for C-3 (d136.0) and the anomeric hydrogen H-100 (d 5.38) in the gHMBC spectrum indicated the position of the rhamnosyl unit at C-3 of the kaempferol moiety. Further analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) indicated an additional methylgallate unit in compound 1, which was placed at C-300 of the rhamnopyranosyl moi- ety due to the downﬁeld chemical shift observed for H-300 (d 5.11), and a gHMBC cross-peak of H-300 with the car- bonyl ester C-7000 (d 167.7). An additional gHMBC correla- tion was observed between the signal at d 141.2 (C-4000) and d 3.77 (OMe) which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-4000. Hence, the structure of pterogynoside (1) was completely elucidated, and established as kaempfer- ol-3-O-(300-O-4000-methylgallate-a-L-rhamnoside. Addition- ally, six known ﬂavonols were isolated and identiﬁed as kaempferol (2) (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (3) (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (4) (Pizzolatti et al., 2003), quer- cetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) (Markham et al., 1978). Their identiﬁcation was based on analyses of 1H, 13C NMR and MS data, as well as by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory. Furthermore, this is the ﬁrst report of ﬂavonol glycosides from P. nitens. Although a broad spectrum of biological activities has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids (Middleton et al., 2000; Cuzzocrea et al., 2001; Havsteen, 2002; Mol- lace et al., 2005), few studies have been devoted to the mye- loperoxidase inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols (Kato et al., 2003). Myeloperoxidase production is triggered by inﬂamma- tory mediators resulting in acceleration of superoxide anion (O 2 ) conversion to hydrogen peroxide an other ROS especially HOCl, which reacts further to generate sin- glet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (HO) as powerful oxidizing agents. Such species are involved in oxidative stress-related diseases as atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer disease etc., which evidences the importance of research towards new MPO inhibitors. All isolates were assayed for their MPO inhibitory activ- ity (Table 2), evidencing a key role of the B ring oxygena- tion pattern on the level of activity. Compounds 5–7, presenting a catechol derived B-ring, exhibited IC50 values of 1.22, 3.75 and 3.60 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1–4, which are kaempferol derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. The aglycone quercetin (5) was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003) and presented higher activity than its glucosides isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7), suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-3 for enhancement of the MPO inhibitory activity. This trend has also been observed for kaempferol derivatives 1–4, as the glucosides pterogynoside (1), afzelin (3) and kaempferi- trin (4) exhibited IC50 values of 10.3, 13.9 and 15.8 nM, respectively, and were less active than the aglycone kaempferol (2, IC50 8.3 nM). These results indicate a clear positive correlation between MPO inhibitory activity and antioxidant properties of ﬂavonoids as shown in Table 2. The catechol on B ring and the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moieties have been extensively pointed out as the main fea- tures in ﬂavonoids associated with enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant activity (Van Acker et al., 1996). The presence of a galloyl group, e.g. in ﬂavonoids, has also been associ- ated with increased antioxidant capacity (Heijnen et al., 2002). In this respect, the presence of an additional galloyl unit in compound 1 might explain its higher MPO inhibi- tory activity, when compared with compounds 3 and 4. The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging eﬀects using two diﬀerent assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay. Quercetin derivatives 5–7 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with values of IC50 (lg/mL) of 4.12, 4.37 and 4.85, and DPPH with values of 2.60, 2.77 and 3.15, respectively, than kaempferol derivatives 1–4 (Table 2), indicating a major role of the catechol moiety on the B-ring Table 2 Myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory activity and free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) towards ABTS and DPPH of ﬂavonols 1-7 Compound MPO inhibition IC50 (nM)a Free radical scavenging activity ABTS IC50 (lg/mL)a DPPH IC50 (lg/mL)a Pterogynoside (1) 10.3 ± 0.03 8.10 ± 0.1 >80.0 Kaempferol (2) 8.30 ± 0.03 18.0 ± 0.5 17.8 ± 0.8 Afzelin (3) 13.9 ± 0.04 17.0 ± 0.7 >80.0 Kaempferitrin (4) 15.8 ± 0.05 18.5 ± 0.2 55.8 ± 0.8 Quercetin (5)b 1.22 ± 0.01 4.12 ± 0.2 2.60 ± 0.1 Isoquercitrin (6) 3.75 ± 0.02 4.37 ± 0.2 2.77 ± 0.4 Rutin (7) 3.60 ± 0.02 4.85 ± 0.2 3.15 ± 0.3 Trolox – 0.63 ± 0.3 4.72 ± 0.4 a IC50 values were determined by regression linear and expressed as means ± SD of tree replicates. b Quercetin was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003).

Additionally, among compounds 1–4, increas- ing activities were observed for pterogynoside (1) and kaempferol (2), which conﬁrms the importance of the free hydroxyl groups on C-3 (in 2) and the enhancement of RSA due to the galloyl group (in 1) in both assays. Among compounds 5–7, quercetin (5) exhibited higher activity than its 3-O-glucosyl derivatives 6 and 7, which conﬁrmed the inﬂuence of the free-hydroxy group at C-3 for potenti- ating the free radical scavenging activity of ﬂavonoids. 3. Concluding remarks In summary, ﬂavonoids with either the catechol moiety or a,b-unsaturated carbonyl with the free hydroxyl group at C-3 have shown best anti-radicalar and MPO inhibitory properties, which corroborates the involvement of MPO in redox processes. The absence of such features in ptero- gynoside (1) has been counteracted by the galloyl moiety on C-300 leading to MPO inhibitory activity comparable to kaempferol (2), and higher free radical scavenging abil- ity than 2 or its glucosides 3 and 4. Flavonols from P. nitens presented potent inhibition towards the pro-oxidant and pro-inﬂammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase and potent radical scavenging eﬀects, which may be particularly important because they are eas- ily available in the plant kingdom (Middleton et al., 2000) and are able to protect biological systems against stress phenomena such as lipid peroxidation, as shown for a vari- ety of kaempferol derivatives exhibiting high antioxidant selectivity (Gebre-Mariam et al., 2005), and for quercetin and its derivatives, which have been shown to protect cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and calcium dysreg- ulation (Wang and Joseph, 1999). 4. Experimental 4.1. General methods Melting points were recorded on a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melting point apparatus. The 1D – (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D – (1H – 1H gCOSY, gHMQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 126 MHz (13C), using the solvents as an internal standard. Negative-ion high resolution mass spectra were recorded on HRMS ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF instrument (Bruker Dal- tonics). IR spectra absorptions were measured on a Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr discs, whereas UV spectra were acquired on a Perkin Elmer UV–vis Lambda 14P spectrophotometer. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and pre- coated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde- hyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 C. Pre- parative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden. All enzymatic or scavenging free radical assays were performed using a Spectrophotom- eter HP 8543, Diode Array. Guaiacol, ABTS [2,20-azin- obis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were purchased from Sigma Chemical. All other reagents were analytical grade and commercially available. MPO was purchased from Planta Natural Products. 4.2. Plant material Fruits of P. nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A vou- cher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the her- barium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil). 4.3. Extraction and isolation The shade-dried fruits (2 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (15 L 5, at room tempera- ture, for two weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macer- ation with EtOH (25 L 5) at room temperature. The combined ethanol extracts were concentrated in vacuo (< 40 C) to yield 8.0 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH:H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.5 and 3.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue was subjected to silica gel (230–400 mesh) CC eluted with EtOAc/MeOH gradient (0–100% MeOH) to aﬀord eight fractions (E1–E8) and free agly- cones 2 (220.9 mg) and 5 (150.8 mg). Fraction E6 (397.8 mg) was further puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH:- H2O:AcOH (58:42:0.1), UV detection at 254 nm; ﬂow rate 10 mL/min], aﬀording acylated ﬂavonol 1 (115.9 mg) and two ﬂavonol monoglycosides 3 (82.9 mg) and 6 (78.7 mg). The n-BuoH residue was dissolved into MeOH and sub- mitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, aﬀording 23 fractions (B1–B23). After TLC com- parison, fractions B12–B19 were combined (488.3 mg) and puriﬁed by RP-HPLC using MeOH:H2O:AcOH (68:32:0.1) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 254 nm and ﬂow rate of 12 mL/min, aﬀording ﬂavonol diglycosides 4 (150.7 mg) and 7 (299.0 mg). 4.4.

Assay for MPO inhibitory activity MPO inhibitory eﬀects of ﬂavonols 1–7 were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM). The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calcu- lated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at diﬀerent sample concentrations of compounds 1–7 (0.50–50 nM) and in the their absence (Kato et al., 2003). The IC50 values were calculated from the rates calculated on the basis of inhibition percentage expressed in concentration–response curves. 4.6. Evaluation of radical scavenging activity (RSA) Radical scavenging activity (RSA) of compounds 1–7 was determined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS+ [2,20-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sul- fonic acid)] as reagents. Sample solutions of 1–7 and Trolox at various concentrations (10–100 lg/ml) in EtOH were indi- vidually added to 0.6 mM DPPH in EtOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 C for 30 min (Soares et al., 1997; Duarte-Almeida et al., 2006). Remaining DPPH was deter- mined colorimetrically at 531 nm by blanking against abso- lute ethanol. ABTS+ was prepared by reacting 5 mL of ABTS (7 mM) water soln. with 88 lL of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12–16 h before use. Prior to assay ABTS+ stock soln. was diluted with KH2PO4/ K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buﬀer soln. (ratio 1:88). One milliliter ABTS+ was added to glass test tubes containing diﬀerent concentrations of compound 1 and Trolox (0.5–7.0 lg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging activity (Pellegrini et al., 1999). Anti-radical abilities against ABTS+ and DPPH species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (inhibition%) calculated from the equation: Inhibi- tion % = [1 (Asample/A) 100], where A is test absorbance without sample (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with compounds 1–7 or Trolox.

This study provides evidence that the limonoid methyl angolensate (MA) is present at higher concentrations in K. ivorensis with symptoms of stem cankers rather than in the plants without symptoms. A rapid, sensitive and selective HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method (using selected reaction monitoring – SRM – mode) was developed for quantiﬁcation of MA in all aerials parts of such plants, with a good linearity over a range of 0.1–20.0 g/kg, with r2 > 0.996 ± 6.1%. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were less than 0.03 g/kg and 0.08 g/kg, respectively. Relative Standard Deviations (RSDs) ranged from 1.7% to 19.2% for all matrices. While the MA concentration did not change in the stem bark, its amounts increased nearly fourfold in stems and by 20% in leaves, when plants with symptoms were compared with those without symptoms. These data suggest that MA plays a role in plant–pathogen interactions, probably as a phytoanticipin. 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Mahogany trees are characterized by having a high quality hard wood, whose color is yellowish to reddish-brown. Its wood is extensively utilized by the timber industry, and historically, mahogany has been highly valued for centuries. Mahogany is di- rectly associated with Swietenia genera (Meliaceae), such as Swie- tenia mahogany (Cuban mahogany) and Swietenia macrophylla (Brazilian and Honduran mahogany), amongst others (Dünish and Rühmann, 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Gasparotto et al., 2001). However, reforestation programs involving S. macrophylla culti- vars for the Brazilian timber industry have been seriously damaged by attacks from the shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella (Ferreira et al., 2005). This has resulted in serious economic problems for Brazil which is the 4th leading producer of hardwoods worldwide (FAO, 2008). In an attempt to avoid such consequences in the future, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation – Embrapa – has been evaluating changing cultivars of S. macrophylla for trees from the Khaya genus (African mahogany, Meliaceae) over the last decade. Such plants exhibit excellent growth properties, and they are not affected by the shoot borer H. grandella (Ferreira et al., 2005). Re- cently, however, Khaya trees found in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, were infected by a new microbial pathogen. The probable microorgan- ism involved was identiﬁed as Botryosphaeria rhodina, based on morphology, DNA sequences (ITS-1, ITS-2; GenBank EU276018) and pathological data (Niekerk et al., 2004; Slippers et al., 2007; Wet et al., 2008). Infection takes place either through wounds, or directly through the stomata and other openings. These fungi can then persist in healthy tissue. Successful infection and susceptibil- ity of infected trees are closely linked to environmental conditions, where high temperatures, water logging and other forms of stress favor infection, causing stem and branch cankers and dieback. Re- sprouting of the plants, followed by repeated infection, generally results in the development of numerous side branches and conse- quently in badly formed trees (Fig. 1), unsuitable for timber pro- duction, and in some cases tree death. The Khaya genus is a rich source of limonoids with a wide vari- ety of structural types (Olmo et al., 1996, 1997; Ferreira et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008). Apart from the limonoids other constit- uents were also reported for various plants of Khaya, as some pen- tacyclic triterpenes, cycloartanes, sterols, sesquiterpenes, ﬂavonoids and coumarins (Banerji and Nigam, 1984). However, none of these compounds have been implicated in defense re- sponses to a speciﬁc disease in Khaya species. In a previous work, 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 2027–2033 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Phytochemistry journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/phytochem Khaya ivorensis with and without symptoms of stem and branch cankers, caused by B. rhodina, were examined in order to deter- mine whether secondary metabolites present in the plant were produced or accumulated as chemical defense (Reche, 2007; Mar- inho, 2007). These studies gave some preliminary evidence that the limonoid methyl angolensate (MA 1, Fig. 2) was present at higher concentrations in K. ivorensis with symptoms of stem and branch cankers than in those without symptoms. Therefore, HPLC–ESI- MS/MS by the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was em- ployed to develop a speciﬁc and sensitive method for quantifying MA (1) in all aerial parts of plants. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Method development and speciﬁcity A screening by HPLC–ESI-MS was ﬁrst carried out to check whether compounds other than MA (1) were associated with K. ivorensis infection (see Supplementary material). In an attempt to establish a suitable method for detection and quantiﬁcation of MA (1) in different parts of K. ivorensis, the stems, stem bark, and leaves from plants with and without symptoms of stem and branch cankers, caused by B. rhodina, were analyzed by HPLC– ESI-MS/MS using the SRM mode. Investigations, therefore, ini- tially focused on establishing the best extraction and separation conditions for MA (1), and the conditions identiﬁed included ultrasound bath-assisted extraction for 10 min, using ethanol as extracting solvent. Separation of MA (1) was rather difﬁcult, since it often exists as a complex mixture of related limonoids of similar polarity. However, HPLC–ESI-MS/MS using the SRM mode have a number of advantages, including speed of analysis, high sensitivity, wide applicability combined with a good toler- ance toward contaminants, and the ability to analyze complex mixtures (Severino et al., 2009). Therefore, the crude ethanol ex- tracts of the stems, stem bark, and leaves from plants with and without symptoms of stem and branch cankers were re-dissolved in methanol and analyzed by LC–APCI-MS/MS. The mobile phase was determined after testing different compositions of solvents. A good chromatographic resolution was achieved using a gradi- ent H2O, MeOH and iso-PrOH, each one supplemented with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid. This mobile phase provided both excel- lent separation between MA (1) and related compounds, and good ionization levels under the APCI ion source. The SRM tran- sitions were chosen on the basis of the stability of product ions obtained under collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS and also on the basis of interfering compounds from the matrixes. The standard MA (1) used in this study was isolated from the stem of K. ivorensis, and it was identiﬁed on the basis of spectro- scopic data, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those from the literature (Olmo et al., 1997). The second-genera- tion product ion spectrum of MA (1) showed a protonated mol- ecule ([M+H+]) at m/z 471 and some fragments (Fig. 3). Even when the collision energy was high enough to reduce the inten- sity of m/z 471 to less than 5% of the base peak, no other signif- icant transitions were observed (Fig. 3A). The product ions chosen m/z 471 ? 453, m/z 471 ? 439, and m/z 471 ? 411 (Fig. 3), to perform the transitions in SRM mode during the development and application of this method, provided an excel- lent speciﬁcity of the method as shown by the SRM chromato- grams of Fig. 4. The standard addition is recommended for conditions in which the matrix without the analytes cannot be used for preparing the calibration solutions. Thus, calibration curves were made by spiking MA (1) in blank tested samples of leaves, stem bark and stems. The most concentrated point in the spiked stem bark analytical curve exhibited a lower ioniza- tion level (expressed by SRM peak area) than the same point in leaves or even in stems. Stems also exhibit the lower concentra- tion of endogenous MA (1) (Fig. 4). 2.2. Linearity and sensitivity The calibration curves by spiking MA (1) in blank tested sam- ples of leaves, stem bark and stems showed an excellent linearity at a 0.1–20.0 g/kg concentration range, with a correlation coefﬁ- cient above 0.996 ± 6.1% (Table 1) for all curves (Fig. 5). In addition, homoscedasticity tests were performed on each matrix in order to conﬁrm the above linearity. According to Almeida et al. (2002), this test should be performed in each linear regression analysis. Exper- imental F-values (1.34 108 for stems, 4.66 109 for stem bark and 5.17 107 for leaves) clearly indicated that homoscedasticity was not met for a conﬁdence interval of 99% since these values should be lower than 19 (Almeida et al., 2002). Therefore, it was necessary to employ weighting factors for each calibration curve. Such factors were empirically chosen and they were determined according to the lower values of percentage relative errors, ex- tracted from graphics in which residuals are plotted against con- centration. For all blank tested samples of leaves, stem bark and Fig. 1. Disease evolution on Khaya ivorensis: (A) After invasion, the pathogen induces formation of small cankers; (B), (C) and (D) during disease progression in the stem, the stem bark sheds off the infected region and new cankers appear; (E) Nodes are created, promoting re-sprouting of the plants. Fig. 2. Chemical structure of methyl angolensate (MA, 1). 2028 K.V.G. Reche et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 2027–2033 stems a weighting factor of 1/x2 provided the best results (Fig. 6). Analyzing such plots it is possible to realize that the maximum percentage relative errors were fewer than ±20%. This is in accor- dance with those results usually accepted for quantiﬁcation of ana- lytes in vegetal matrices (Gilbert and Anklam, 2002). Therefore, by adjusting weighting factors it was possible to achieve a good line- arity over a range of 0.1–20.0 g/kg. The limits of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) for MA (1) were 3.37 ± 3.6, 3.86 ± 1.0 and 4.41 ± 3.9 ng/mL for leaves, stems, and stem bark, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) were determined at 1.01 ± 4.6, 1.16 ± 0.9 and 1.32 ± 3.8 ng/mL for leaves, stems, and stem bark, respectively, reﬂecting high sensitivity of the proposed method (Table 1). 2.3. Precision and accuracy The intra- and inter-day precisions were assessed using the data of six different concentration of spiking MA (1) in blank tested samples of leaves, stem bark and stems, analyzed over a 5-day per- iod. The results are given in Table 2 and are expressed as Relative Standard Deviations (RSDs). The accuracy evaluated from back cal- culation was determined as the percent deviation between the amount found and the amount added of standard at the six con- centrations examined. However, they were expressed in Table 2 as relative errors, whose values should not vary up to ±20% during the quantiﬁcation process (Gilbert and Anklam, 2002). RSDs values (Table 2) ranged from 1.7 to 19.2% and relative errors from 18.9% Fig. 3. Product ion spectra of MA (1) obtained under CID-MS/MS: (A) 25 eV, 471 [M+H]+, Anal.

Recovery Percentage relative recovery of 80.7%, 89.8% and 29.4% for MA (1) were acquired in blank tested samples of stems, stem bark and leaves, respectively, and they showed RSD ranging from 4.1% to 10.7%, 7.2% to 18.4% and 6.2% to 18.8% (n = 5), respectively (Ta- ble 3). Thus, the proposed method can be considered suitable for quantiﬁcation MA (1) on stems and stem bark. These data suggest that a more selective extraction of MA (1) is necessary during its evaluation on leaves of K. ivorensis. However, the main proposal of this work was to develop a rapid and efﬁcient method for detec- tion and quantiﬁcation of MA (1) in different parts of K. ivorensis plants, employing an extraction step which could be used for stems, stem bark and leaves at the same time. Thus, the proposed method can be considered suitable for quantiﬁcation of MA (1) on plant material. Apparently, no ion suppression occurs when leaves are analyzed, since both RSDs and relative errors evaluated during precision and accuracy steps were smaller than those obtained for stems and stem bark (Table 2). So far, it appears that nothing has been reported on the current literature concerning quantiﬁcation of MA (1) on any plant species. This fact certainly makes difﬁcult a comparison between recovery Fig. 5. Analytical curves obtained for each matrix. Fig. 6. Graphics showing residuals against concentration: (A) stems; (B) bark; (C) leaves. In all cases, residuals were fewer than 20%. Such residuals were obtained using a weighting factor of 1/x2.

Therefore, a concise HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method, in which both time-consuming and la- bor tasks could be avoided, should be preferred rather than employing different extraction and clean-up procedures for differ- ent matrices. 2.5. Method application to K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stems and branch cankers, caused by B. rhodina The HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method has been applied to quantiﬁca- tion of MA (1) in the stems, stem bark, and leaves from plants of K. ivorensis with and without symptoms of stem cankers, caused by B. rhodina (Fig. 7). MA (1) in the samples was expressed as g/ kg of stems, bark, or leaves. MA (1) was found in all samples. The concentration of MA (1) in stem bark without symptoms of stem cankers was 1.86 g/kg ±5.5%, and similar proportions were present in those with symptoms, 1.61 g/kg ±16.7%. On the other hand, MA (1) was observed in markedly higher concentration in stems with symptoms (1.23 g/kg ±8.0%) than in those without symptoms (0.34 g/kg ±10.4%). These data suggest that MA (1) plays a role in plant–pathogen interaction, probably as a phytoanticipin (Griebel and Zeier, 2008; Pedras et al., 2005; Adesogan and Taylor, 1967). Biosynthesis of such a metabolite might represent a plant defense strategy in response to the pathogen attack, since this compound is reported to have antimicrobial activity (Chiruvella et al., 2007; Abdelgaleil et al., 2004). MA (1) was also observed in higher concentrations in leaves with symptoms (4.3 g/kg ±0.44%) than in those without symptoms (3.28 g/kg ±0.294%). Thus, assuming that MA (1) acts as a phytoan- ticipin, such behavior could be understood as a chemical-signaling for the whole plant. Increasing MA (1) concentration in leaves, the plant might prevent additional infection by avoiding pathogen penetration into the stomata. However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of MA (1) in plant–pathogen inter- action until isolated MA (1) can be evaluated in direct bioassays with B. rhodina, which is currently in progress. 3. Conclusions A HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determination of the limonoid MA (1) in different parts of K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stem cankers caused by B. rhodina. As expected, stem and leaves of symptomatic plants presented a larger concentration of MA suggesting that this limonoid acts as a good barrier for the growth of B. rhodina. These data stimulated an investigation of MA (1) as B. rhodina inhibitor. Experiments on the dose–response of B. rhodina to MA (1) are in progress. 4. Experimental 4.1. General experimental procedures All organic solvents used were of analytical grade and pur- chased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and for LC–APCI–MS/ MS they were HPLC grade purchased from JT Baker (Ecatepec, Mex- ico); prior to use they were ﬁltered through a polytetraﬂuoroethyl- ene (PTFE) membrane Millipore ﬁlter (0.45 m) and degassed by sonication for 15 min. Water puriﬁed (18 M<OMEGA>) by a reverse osmosis Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for all solutions. All specimens were separately dried in an air circular oven (Tecnal, TE-394/3, Piracicaba, Brazil), powdered using a mill (Tecnal, TE-340, Piracicaba, Brazil) and granular sizes were homog- enized using a granular sieve (75 m; 200 mesh), (Tecnal TE-631, São Paulo, Brazil). Liquid chromatography coupled with atmo- sphere pressure chemical ionization and tandem mass spectrome- try data (LC–APCI–MS/MS) were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography, and mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaﬂow electrospray probe. All MS data were ac- quired and processed using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, United Kingdom), with processed charts constructed using Origin 6.0 software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA, USA). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) (1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz). 4.2. Plant material K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stem cankers, caused by B. rhodina, were collected on October 15th 2006 at the Cacao Research Experimental Unit (CEPLAC), Experimental Forest Station ‘‘Sosthenes de Miranda” (ESOMI), located in São Sebastião da Posse city in Bahia State, Brazil. Plant collection was supervised by Dr. Manfred Willy Müller from CEPLAC (BH4863). 4.3. Extraction procedure Individually, stem bark, stems and leaves of K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stem cankers were powdered and granular sizes were homogenized using a granular sieve (75 m; 200 mesh). From homogenized ground stem bark, stems and leaves 50.0 ± 1.0 mg were ultrasound bath-assisted extracted three times for 10 min using ethanol as extracting solvent. Crude ethanolic ex- tracts were obtained after ﬁltration through a polytetraﬂuoroethyl- ene (PTFE) membrane Millipore ﬁlter (0.45 m). The samples were diluted affording solutions of 1 ppm. Aliquot of 60 lL of each sam- ple was evaporated to dryness by vacuum (Savant SpeedVac Plus CS 10A, São Paulo, Brazil) at 42 C for two hours, affording the con- centrated extract. The dry residues were reconstituted in MeOH (1 mL) for HPLC–ESI-MS/MS analysis. 4.4. Extraction and isolation of methyl angolensate standard Ground stems (1.4 kg) from healthy K. ivorensis were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH, at room temper- ature, three times. The concentrated hexane extract (30 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (70– 230 mesh) under vacuum. Elution with hexane–EtOAc gradient yielded four fractions. Puriﬁcation of fraction 4 was carried out Fig. 7.

Reche et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 2027–2033 2031 by applying it to an ODS (C18) SPE cartridge. The solvent was re- moved from the cartridge under vacuum. The eluent was evapo- rated and re-suspended in MeOH and subjected to Reversed phase-HPLC (H2O–MeOH 28:72; detection, UV 217 nm, ﬂow rate, 4.7 mL min1, Phenomenex Gemini C18 column, 250 10 mm i.d.) yielding MA 1 (24.8 mg) and other limonoids. 4.5. Calibration standard and analytical curves A stock solution of MA (1) at 1000 lg/mL was prepared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) and working solutions at 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 ng/mL were prepared by serial dilu- tion. Individually, stem bark, stems and leaves concentrated ex- tract (prepared as described in Section 4.3) were reconstituted in 1 mL of such working solutions for HPLC–ESI-MS/MS analysis. Then, MA (1) in the samples expressed as g/kg of stems, stem bark, or leaves were 0.1, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 20.0 g/kg. All calibration standard curves were obtained in triplicate. The dynamic range used was from 5 to 1000 ng/mL (0.1–20 g/kg) for all analyzed curves. Calibration curves were obtained by plotting concentration (ng/mL and g/kg) in axis x per area below SRM peaks (arbitrary units) in axis y. 4.6. HPLC and MS parameters LC–APCI–MS/MS data were acquired using a Luna ODS analyti- cal column (150 4.6 mm i.d., 5 m, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), samples (20 lL) were injected into the analytical column un- der a ﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/min, the column was maintained at 20 C in all runnings; the gradient elution system consisted of the follow- ing steps (H2O, MeOH and iso-PrOH in lines A, B and C respectively, each one supplemented with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid, TFA): a gra- dient elution starting at 70:30:0 (A:B:C) and varying linearly to 10:90:0 (A:B:C) for 25 min; then, a new linear variation was em- ployed varying from 10:90:0 (A:B:C) to 0:100:0 (A:B:C) for 30 min; the column was then washed with a new linear variation from 0:100:0 (A:B:C) to 0:90:10 (A:B:C) for 35 min, and re-condi- tioned with 70:30:0 (A:B:C) for 5 min; a ﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/min was used for the analysis; mass spectral data were acquired in po- sitive ion mode; nitrogen was used for nebulizatioin (12 L h1) and desolvation (820 L h1); the capillary voltage was set at 3.27 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 32 and 5 V respectively; argon (Ar) was used for the product ions experiments (CID-MS). For SRM experiments, the cone voltage was maintained using tune parameters previously optimized for all compounds at 32 V, and three transitions were selected: m/z 471 ? 453 and m/z 471 ? 439 (monitoring) and m/z 471 ? 411 (quantiﬁcation), using a collision energy (CE) of 15 eV. The dwell time was 0.3 s, and the interscan delay was 0.02 s. The collision gas pressure (argon) was set at 1.40 e3 mbar for all experiments. Software: All MS data were acquired and processed using Mass- Lynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, United Kingdom). 4.7. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantiﬁcation (LOQ) Individually, stem bark, stems and leaves concentrated extract (prepared as described in Section 4.3) were reconstituted in 1 mL of MeOH and limits of detection (LOD) were performed using the signal-to-noise ratio – 3/1 criterion. Limits of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were established analyzing the same standard samples with serial diluted solutions, and were considered as the concentration at which the method is able to quantify the substance with accept- able accuracy and precision, i.e. with relative standard deviation (RSDs) and 20% variability. The limits were tested by injecting standard samples replicating each injection at least three times. 4.8. Speciﬁcity, linearity, precision, and accuracy Speciﬁcity was assessed by using three different transitions for quantiﬁcation of MA (1) in the SRM mode. Linearity was achieved by coefﬁcients of determination (r2) of analytical curves prepared as described in Section 4.5. Linearity studies of these curves were also accomplished using homoscedas- ticity test according to Almeida et al. (2002). Precision and accuracy were evaluated by individual analyses of stem bark, stems and leaves concentrated extract (prepared as de- scribed in Section 4.3) reconstituted in 1 mL of working solutions of MA (1) at 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 ng/mL (or expressed as g/kg of stems, stem bark, or leaves: 0.1, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 20.0 g/ kg). Each concentration was analyzed on ﬁve non-consecutive days. The results are given in Table 2 and are expressed as Relative Standard Deviations (RSDs). The accuracy evaluated from back cal- culation was determined as the percent deviation between amount found and amount added of standard at the six concentrations examined, but expressed as relative errors in Table 2. 4.9. Recovery A stock solution of MA (1) at 1000 lg/mL was prepared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) and working solutions of 6.0, 600.0 and 900 ng/mL were prepared by serial dilution. Then, aliquots of each solutions (1.0 mL) were added individually to powdered stem bark, stems and leaves (50 ± 1.0 mg) from K. ivor- ensis plant without symptoms of stem cankers, and dried under N2 ﬂow for 2 h. Thereafter, samples were submitted to solvent extraction as described in Section 4.3. Each sample was evaporated to dryness by vacuum (Savant SpeedVac Plus CS 10A, São Paulo, Brazil) at 42 C for two hours, affording the spiked quality controls (QCs). The dry residues were reconstituted in MeOH (1 mL) for HPLC–ESI-MS/MS analysis. Recoveries were calculated by compar- ing spiked quality controls (QCs) with directly-extracted QCs at same concentrations. SRM areas of each quality control were di- rectly compared with spiked quality controls (ﬁvefold for each one). Concentrations of low (LQC), medium (MQC) and high quality controls (HQC) were set at 6.0 ng/mL (0.16 g/kg), 600 ng/mL (12.0 g/kg) and 900 ng/mL (18.0 g/kg), respectively.

Introduction Fungal endophytes comprise a wide range of fungi character- ized by the ability to live for a certain period of their life-cycles internally and asymptomatically in plants (Wang et al., 2007). Such co-existence may confer adaptative advantages to the plant host, such as feeding deterrence, protection against insects and microbial pathogens (De Souza et al., 2004). Considering that chemical clues are usually involved in these biological interactions, natural products from endophytic fungi very often present a broad spectrum of biological activities (Zhang et al., 2006). Isocoumarins are metabolites of limited distribution, which occur in bacteria, fungi and lichen (Kutschera et al., 2003). These compounds have also been detected in secretions of termites and ants (Engelmeier et al., 2004). Several biological activities have been reported for this class, including cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antiallergic, algicidal, gastroprotective, protease inhibitory, anti- fungal (O¨ zcan et al., 2007; Krohn et al., 1997; Guimara˜es et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009) as well as plant growth regulators (Kuramata et al., 2007). The Brazilian cerrado trees are well known sources of bioactive secondary metabolites (Bolzani et al., 1991; Young et al., 1992; Silva et al., 2007, 2010). Among these, A. macrophylla K. Schum (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were chosen for a detailed microbiological investigation. These plants presented several endophytes, including Penicillium and Xylaria species, which were submitted to chemical and biological investigations. Herein, we report the isolation and biological activities of one new dihydroisocoumarin, (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6-dihydroxy-3- methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid (1) and two known dihydroisocoumarins, (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Fig. 1). 2. Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as yellow amorphous powder, and showed a positive reaction with ferric chloride suggesting the presence of a phenol functionality. The IR spectrum of 1 showed strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (3474 cm1) and a conjugated carbonyl group (1672 cm1). The UV spectrum of 1 displayed absorptions (lmax) (log e) at 220 (4.28) and 314 (3.34), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a dihydroisocoumarin structure (Pontius et al., 2008). Its elemental composition C11H10O6 with seven degrees of insaturation was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([MH]) at m/z 237.0381 (calcd for C11H9O6, 237.0399), consistent with its 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

Additionally, two known compounds, (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3), were isolated from Penicillium sp. associated to Alibertia macrophylla (Rubiaceae).

Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.phytol.2010.11.003 gHMBC NMR experiments enabled us to assign all 1H and 13C signals. The 13C NMR, DEPT 908, and 1H–13C gHMQC indicated that compound 1 had one methyl, four methines, and six quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 169.5 and d 167.1, assigned toa carboxyl and toad-lactonegroups, respectively.The 1H NMR and 1H–1H gCOSY spectra of 1 showed two ortho-coupled hydrogens at d 7.04 (H-8) and d 8.10 (H-9), suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 1H–1H gCOSY spectrum indicated a spin system in 1 which included a methyl group atd 1.43 (H3C-10) coupled with an oxymethine hydrogen at d 4.72 (H-3), itselfcoupledwithamethinehydrogenatd5.47(H-4).Therefore,the aliphatic portion of 1 was unambiguously established as a H3C– CH(O–)–CH–OH chain. Long-range correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum between H-7 (d 7.04) with C-6 (d 163.9), C-5 (d 108.7), and C-8a (d 120.0), between H-4 (d 5.47) with C-4a (d 144.8), C-5, C-8a and C-3 (d 78.2), as well as between H-8 (d 8.10) with C-6, C-1 (d 167.1) and C-4a enabled us to establish unequivocally the substitution pattern of the aromatic moiety of 1. A logical deduction ofthe datacollectedwouldobviouslyleadtothe structure1.SinceH- 3 and H-4 showed a coupling constant of 1.8 Hz, these protons had an axial–equatorial relationship. Thus, the relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was established as (3R*, 4R*). This relative conﬁguration at C-3 and C-4 was very similar when compared with data of similar isochromanes (Okuno et al., 1986; Aldridge et al., 1971). A comparison of the optical rotation of 1 ([a]D 28 60.3, c 0.034, MeOH)withthe literature values reportedfor three of the four possible 4-hydroxymellein stereoisomers (Devys et al., 1980) indicated that (3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-mellein has both the signal and magnitude of optical rotation ([a]D 1.5) comparable to compound 1. Therefore, the absolute conﬁguration of 1 was assigned as (3R,4R) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Hence, the structure of compound 1 was completely elucidated, and established as (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6- dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid. In addition, two known dihydroisocoumarins were isolated from a Penicillium sp. and identiﬁed as (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Compounds 2 and 3 were identiﬁed by analysis of spectroscopic data, as well as of optical rotation data, with literature values. Both 2 and 3 exhibited a rare 7,8-dihydroxy substitution. To date, related compounds have been isolated from plant and fungi sources, including Azadirachta indica, Septoria nodorum, Cytospora eucalypticola, Nodulisporum sp. and Cephalosporium sp. (Devys et al., 1980; Siddiqui et al., 1988; Kokubun et al., 2003; Bi et al., 2006; Pontius et al., 2008). The cathecol moiety of 2 and 3 is probably formed after an additional oxidation at C-7, subsequently to the formation of the aromatic polyketide skeleton. Dihydroisocoumarins 1–3 were evaluated for their antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladospor- ioides using direct bioautography assay (Table 1) (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds 2 and 3 showed a potent effect against the yeasts, exhibiting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 mg against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 1 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity towards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 mg, respectively. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydroisocoumarins and catechol moiety at C-7 and C-8. The identiﬁcation of the compounds 1–3, potentially bioactive against the phytopathogenic fungi, indicates that they act as defense of the host species against possible infection by pathogens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for metabolites from Penicillium and Xylaria genera, few studies have been devoted to the acetylcholin- esterase inhibitory activity of this class of pentaketides. Com- pounds 2 and 3 showed a limit of detection of 10 mg in a TLC-based AChE inhibition assay which was considered as weakly potent. Dihydroisocoumarin 1 displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 3.0 mg. In conclusion, three dihydrocoumarin derivatives, one new from Xylaria sp. and two known from Penicillium sp., associated with P. aduncum and A. macrophylla leaves, respectively, have been isolated and identiﬁed and exhibited antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results herein reported suggest that dihydrocoumarins should be considered as potential lead com- pounds in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for use in the drug design for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the non-deuterated residual signal as refer- ence. Mass spectra were measured on a LC–MS Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using the ESI mode and MeOH–H2O (1:1) as eluent (cone voltage 25 V). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde- hyde–H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 8C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C18 (250 mm 21.2 mm) preparative column. Ana- lytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 HPLC system using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica [()TD$FIG] OH HO O O OH CH3 OH HO O O CH3 2 3 10 9 O O OH CH3 1 1 4 4a 7 8a HO CO2H Fig. 1. Structures of compounds 1–3.

Optical rotations were measured with PerkinElmer polarimeter with sodium lamp operating at 589 nm at 28 8C. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated A. macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were collected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Ecolo´gica Experimental de Mogi-Guac¸u, Fazenda Campininha’’, Mogi-Guac¸u, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identiﬁcations were assigned by Dr. Ineˆs Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher no. SP 370915 and Cordeiro PAO, respectively). 3.3. Isolation and identiﬁcation of the endophytes Adult and healthy leaves of P. aduncum and A. macrophylla were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. Leaves were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and in 70% aqueous EtOH for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate (50 mg/mL), 3–4 pieces on each dish. The material of the two species was incubated at 25 8C for 10 days and the endophytes Penicillium sp. and Xylaria sp. were isolated by successive inoculation in Petri dishes from Alibertia macrophyla and P. aduncum, respectively (Silva et al., 2006). The fungus Penicillium sp. was identiﬁed by Dr. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quı´micas, Biolo´ gicas e Agrı´colas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number 05070032-C. The fungus Xylaria sp. was identiﬁed by Prof. Dr. Ludwing H. Pfenning (Universidade Federal de Lavras, Departamento de Fitopatologia) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number PA-01. 3.4. Growth of Xylaria sp. and extraction The strain was inoculated in twenty Erlenmeyers (500 mL each) containing each one: 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose (PDB) in 300 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved at 121 8C for 15 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, for 28 days. The mycelia biomass accumulated in the Erlenmeyers was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was subjected to a liquid–liquid partition with EtOAc (3 2 L). The EtOAc fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g). 3.4.1. Extraction and isolation of compound 1 The crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g) was puriﬁed by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting with MeOH, to afford 08 fractions (F-1–F-8, 100 mL portions). Compound 1 (175.0 mg) was obtained from fractions F-6 to F-7 as a yellow amorphous powder. 3.5. Growth of Penicillium sp. and growth medium extraction The Penicillium sp. strain was inoculated in nine Erlenmeyers (500 mL each), containing each one: 90 g of corn meal in 75 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 8C for 40 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C in still mode during 21 days. At the end of the growth period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 250 mL). The MeOH was evaporated, to give 15 g of the MeOH extract. The MeOH extract was dissolved in MeCN and then subjected to liquid– liquid partition with hexane. The MeCN fraction was evaporated to give 6.0 g of a MeCN-deffated extract. 3.5.1. Extraction and Isolation of compounds 2 and 3 The MeCN-deffated fraction obtained (6.0 g) was fractionated using a C18 reversed-phase CC, eluted with a gradient of MeOH in H2O (5–100% MeOH), to afford 16 fractions (Fr1–Fr16). Fraction Fr- 2 (218.0 mg) was further separated using RP-HPLC [l = 254 nm, 10.0 ml/min, 8:2 H2O–MeCN (80 min)], to give compounds 2 (6.3 mg, Rt = 40.3 min) and 3 (6.1 mg, Rt = 30.0 min).

Antifungal activity Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. Compounds 1–3 were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.00 and 1.00 mg samples of pure compounds. After eluting with CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the plates were sprayed with the fungi suspension (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was used as a positive control at 1.0 mg. 3.7. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity Acetylcholinesterase (1000 U) was dissolved in 150 mL of 0.05 M Tris–hydrochloric acid buffer at pH 7.8. Bovine serum albumin (150 mg) was added to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 8C. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol) in order to clean the plates before drying at 30 8C. After elution of samples in CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the TLC plates were dried at 30 8C for complete removal of solvent. The plates were then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and carefully dried at r.t. again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was deposited ﬂat over plastic plugs in a covered plastic tank containing a small amount of H2O, in order to keep the humidity constant. The incubation of plates was performed at 37 8C for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1- naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple coloration after 1–2 min (if positive). Galantamine was employed as positive control 1.0 mg (Marston et al., 2002).

In the present work, the cytotoxicity of pristimerin was eval- uated in human tumor cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This work also examined the eﬀects of pri- stimerin (0.4; 0.8 and 1.7 lM) in HL-60 cells, after 6, 12 and 24 h of exposure. Pristimerin reduced the number of viable cells and increased number of non-viable cells in a concentration-dependent manner by tripan blue test showing morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. Nevertheless, pristimerin was not selective to cancer cells, since it inhibited PBMC proliferation with an IC50 of 0.88 lM. DNA synthesis inhibition assessed by 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in HL-60 cells was 70% and 83% for the concen- trations of 0.4 and 0.8 lM, respectively. Pristimerin (10 and 20 lM) was not able to inhibit topoisomerase I. In AO/EB (acridine orange/ ethidium bromide) staining, all tested concentrations reduced the number of HL-60 viable cells, with the occurrence of necrosis and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, results in agreement with trypan blue exclusion ﬁndings. The analysis of membrane integrity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by ﬂow cytometry in the presence of pristimerin indicated that treated cells under- went apoptosis. The present data point to the importance of pristimerin as representative of an emerging class of potential anticancer chemicals, exhibiting an antiproliferative eﬀect by inhibiting DNA synthesis and triggering apoptosis. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite many therapeutic advances, mortality is still unacceptably high (Reddy et al., 2003). Most of the drugs used today in the clinic were ﬁrst discovered from plants and microorganisms (Mann, 2002). Thus, natural products continue to perform an essential role in the search for new anti-cancer molecules. Chemical studies carried out on Celastraceae species have revealed the occurrence of phenolic metabolites, such as condensed tannins (Gonzalez et al., 1982), ﬂavonoids (Corsino et al., 2003) and quinonemethide triterpenes (Cor- sino et al., 2000; Buﬀa Filho et al., 2002a,b; Carvalho et al., 2005). The quinonemethide triterpenoids of the Celastra- ceae family have a variety of biological activities, such as 0887-2333/$ - see front matter 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Pessoa). www.elsevier.com/locate/toxinvit Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971), antioxi- dant (Jeller et al., 2004; Carvalho et al., 2005) and antima- larial (Figueiredo et al., 1998). Maytenus ilicifolia Martius (Celastraceae) is popularly known as ‘‘espinheira santa”, being well known for allevi- ating stomach pain, nausea and treating ulcers and gastritis (Camparoto et al., 2002). In vivo studies have proved the eﬀectiveness of M. ilicifolia in ethanol- and/or indometha- cin-induced gastric lesion models (Bersani-Amado et al., 2000). Pristimerin (Fig. 1) (20a-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-24-nor-frie- dela-1-10,3,5,7-tetraen-carboxylic acid-29-methylester) is a quinonemethide triterpenoid, which in nature is restricted to the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families (Dirsch et al., 1997). Dirsch et al. (1997) demonstrated that pristim- erin inhibits the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by a mechanism that involves inhibition of NFKB activation, thereby contributing to its anti-inﬂammatory activity. It is also known that pristimerin exhibits cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines (Chang et al., 2003). However, the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic eﬀect of pristimerin has not been completely explored. In 2005, Wu et al. (2005), observed that human breast cancer cells (MDA/ MB-231) treated with pristimerin showed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and a decrease of mito- chondrial membrane potential leading to apoptosis. More recently, Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated that pristimerin induces death of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) by its potent proteasomal inhibition. Although this compound has a variety of reported bio- logical activities, the eﬀect of pristimerin on human leuke- mia cell lines and the underlying mechanism of action have never been investigated. In this way, the aim of the present work was to determine the antiproliferative eﬀects of pri- stimerin on diﬀerent human cancer cell lines and in periph- eral blood monocluear cells (PBMC). Its mechanism of action was also evaluated in leukemia cancer cell line HL-60. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Extraction and isolation of pristimerin Dried and powdered root bark of M. ilicifolia (900.0 g) was extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to aﬀord a brown gum (606.0 g), which was submitted to liquid-liquid partition- ing. The CH2Cl2 soluble part of the EtOH extract was con- centrated in vacuo (121.0 g), submitted to a silica gel column chromatography (700 g, 70–230 mesh) with hex- ane/EtOAc gradient elution, yielding 43 fractions (A1– A43). Fraction A10–A14 (2.88 g) was submitted to ﬂash sil- ica gel column chromatography (230–400 mesh) with hex- ane/EtOAc gradient elution, resulting in 38 fractions (B1–B38). Fraction B12–B14 (0.609 g) was submitted to preparatory reverse phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), c = 420 nm, 10 mL/min] to aﬀord pristimerin (retention time = 21.0 min; 0.310 g; MW = 464.6). 2.2. Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines The cytotoxic potential of pristimerin was evaluated by the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983), against ﬁve human tumor cell lines: HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), K-562 (chronic myelocytic leukemia), SF-295 (glyoblastoma), HCT-8 (colon cancer) and MDA/MB-435 (melanoma), all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin, at 37 C with 5% CO2. Tumor cell growth was quantiﬁed by the ability of living cells to reduce the yel- low dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetra- zolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product (Mosmann, 1983). Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.7 105 cells/well for adherent cells and 0.3 105 cells/well for suspended cells) and pristimerin (0.08–53.7 lM) dissolved in DMSO 1% was added to each well. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL). Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dis- solved in 150 lL DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). Doxorubicin was used as positive control. The cytotoxicity of pristimer- in was also evaluated after 24 h of incubation in order to establish the concentrations for the studies in HL-60 cells. 2.3. Inhibition of PBMC proliferation – Alamar Blue assay In order to investigate the selectivity of pristimerin toward a normal proliferating cell, the Alamar Blue assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug exposure. Heparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug at least 15 days prior to sampling) was collected and O H O CH3 C H3 CH3 CH3 CH3 C H3 O O CH3 H Fig. 1. Structure of pristimerin isolated from M. ilicifolia. P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 855 PBMC were isolated by a standard method of density-gra- dient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 3 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mL streptomycin at 37 C with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (3%) was added at the beginning of culture. After 24 h, the compound (0.08–53.7 lM) dis- solved in DMSO 1% were added to each well and incu- bated for 72 h. Doxorubicin (0.02–8.6 lM) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incuba- tion, 10 lL of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of the Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma–Aldrich Co) was added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter) and the drug eﬀect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of con- trol absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of the medium is also measured at the higher and lower wave- lengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absor- bance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absor- bance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOLW. A correction factor R0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOLW, where R0 = AOLW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced then is expressed as follows: % reduced = ALW(AHW R0) 100. 2.4. Study of the mechanism involved in the leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity The following experiments were performed in order to investigate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic eﬀect of pristimerin against HL-60 cells using a 24 h exposure. Pristimerin dissolved in sterilized DMSO (vehicle control) was added to cell cultures of HL-60 cells (3 105 cells/ mL) to obtain ﬁnal concentrations of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 lM, corresponding to IC50/2, IC50 and two times IC50 values obtained by the MTT assay after 24 h of incubation. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. 2.4.1. Trypan blue exclusion Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (Renzi et al., 1993) after incubation of HL- 60 cells with pristimerin. Aliquots from wells were removed from cultures after 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber. 2.4.2. Inhibition of DNA synthesis HL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with pristimerin. Before the end of a 24 h drug exposure, 20 lL of 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37 C. To determine the amount of BrdU incorpo- rated into DNA (Pera et al., 1977), cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and covers- lipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was per- formed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per sample to determine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. 2.4.3. DNA relaxation assay The inhibitory eﬀects of pristimerin (10 and 20 lM) on human Topo I were measured using Topo I Drug Screen- ing Kit (TopoGEN, Inc.). Supercoiled (Form I) plasmid DNA (250 ng) was incubated with human Topo I (4 units) at 37 C for 30 min in relaxation buﬀer (10 mM Tris buﬀer pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine and 5% glycerol) in the absence or presence of 10 and 20 lM pristimerin (ﬁnal 20 lL). Campothecin (0.1 mM) was used as positive control. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10% SDS (2 lL). Proteinase K (50 lg/mL) was added and incubated at 37 C for 30 min. DNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel for 120 min at room temperature, and visual- ized with ethidium bromide. 2.4.4. Analysis of morphological changes Untreated or pristimerin-treated HL-60 cells were exam- ined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metr- impex Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar lab). To evaluate morphology, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, ﬁxed with ethanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H/E). Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. 2.4.5. Morphological analysis with ﬂuorescence microscopy Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining (McGahon et al., 1995) of HL-60 cells was performed to evaluate the cell death pattern induced by increasing con- centrations of pristimerin. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. After 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted and each sample was mixed with 1 lL of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 lg/mL of AO in PBS; 100 lg/mL EB in PBS) just prior to ﬂuorescence micros- copy and quantiﬁcation (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hundred cells were counted per sample and scored as fol- lows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells (Geng et al., 2003; Cury-Boaventura et al., 2004). 2.4.6. Flow cytometry analysis 2.4.6.1. Cell membrane integrity. HL-60 cell membrane integrity was evaluated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 lg/mL). Cell ﬂuorescence was then determined by ﬂow cytometry in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were 856 P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 evaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.4.6.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. HL-60 cells were incubated at 25 C for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 lg/mL propidium iodide. Cell ﬂuorescence was then determined by ﬂow cytometry in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.5. Statistical analysis For cytotoxicity assays, the IC50 values and their 95% conﬁdence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Graphpad program (Intuitive Software for Sci- ence, San Diego, CA). In order to determine diﬀerences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman–Keuls test (P < 0.01). 3. Results 3.1. Cytotoxicity assays The MTT analysis showed that pristimerin exhibited cytotoxic activity against all ﬁve cancer cell lines. Based on data collected from two independent experiments car- ried out in triplicate, the IC50 values ranged from 0.55 to 3.2 lM in MDA/MB-435 and K-562, respectively, after 72 h of incubation with pristimerin (Table 1). The IC50 val- ues obtained in PBMC for pristimerin and doxorubicin were 0.88 (0.75–1.03) and 1.66 (0.89–3.10) lM, respec- tively, also after 72 h of incubation. All subsequent experiments were conducted on HL-60 cell lines to determine the mechanism of action of pristim- erin in this cell line. 3.2. Pristimerin reduces cell viability and inhibits DNA synthesis Pristimerin produced a signiﬁcant decrease (P < 0.01) in cell viability and increased number of non-viable cells as soon as 6 h exposure, which occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). To further under- stand the antiproliferative activity, the incorporation of the nucleoside BrdU into DNA was measured by direct perox- idase immunocytochemistry assay. In Fig. 3, we can see that HL-60 cells treated by pristimerin showed about 30% and 17% of BrdU incorporation at the concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 lM, respectively (P < 0.01), while doxorubi- cin (0.6 lM) lead to 24% of incorporation. BrdU positive cells in control correspond to 65%. Since pristimerin was able to inhibit DNA synthesis, it could be a suitable candi- date to cause inhibition of topoisomerase. However, pri- stimerin (10 and 20 lM) did not show any eﬀect in the DNA relaxation assay (data not shown). 3.3. Pristimerin alters cell morphology Analysis by H/E of HL-60 treated and untreated cells revealed several drug-induced morphological changes. Con- trol cells exhibited a typical non-adherent and vacuolization round morphology after 24 h in culture (Fig. 4A). The cells treated at all concentrations showed a progressive DNA fragmentation, a reduction in cell volume and destabiliza- tion of the plasma membrane, indicating an increasing pro- gression toward cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C–E). Pyknotic nuclei were observed at higher doses as early as 6 h of treatment. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) also induced reduction in cell volume, besides nuclear fragmenta- tion and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). 3.4. Pristimerin induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells To further determine whether the growth-inhibitory eﬀect of pristimerin was related to the induction of apopto- sis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/ EB staining by ﬂuorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment with the compound, a decreasing number of viable cells (Fig. 5A) and an increasing number of apop- totic cells (Fig. 5B) were observed in a dose-dependent manner. As early as 6 h of pristimerin (0.4 lM) exposure (P < 0.01), apoptosis was observed. Regarding necrosis, a signiﬁcant increase was seen at 0.8 lM after 6 h of treat- ment (Fig. 5C), while extensive cell damage indicative of necrosis occurred only at 1.7 lM after 24 h (P < 0.01). 3.5. Pristimerin disrupts cell membrane integrity The propidium iodide intercalation test showed that pri- stimerin caused disruption of the cell membrane in HL-60 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The results revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in cell viability starting at 0.8 lM Table 1 Cytotoxic activity of pristimerin in tumor cell lines Substance CI50 (lg/ml (lM))a HL-60 K-562 MDA/MB- 435 SF-295 HCT-8 Doxorubicin 0.02 (0.04) 0.14 (0.24) 0.48 (0.83) 0.23 (0.40) 0.01 (0.02) 0.01–02 0.09–23 0.34–0.66 0.19– 0.25 0.01– 0.02 Pristimerin 0.61 (1.31) 1.49 (3.20) 0.26 (0.55) 0.57 (1.22) 0.69 (1.48) 0.56– 0.67 1.17– 1.90 0.20–0.34 0.38– 0.85 0.59– 0.82 a Data are presented as IC50 values and 95% conﬁdence intervals for leukemia (HL-60, K562), breast (MDA/MB-435), glyoblastoma (SF-295) and colon (HCT-8) human cancer cells.

This activity was also shown to be dependent on time exposure (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). 3.6. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was examined by ﬂow cytometry in HL-60 cells. All DNA that was sub-dip- loid in size was considered fragmented. All concentrations of pristimerin tested led to a signiﬁcant increase in DNA fragmentation (P < 0.01) in a time- and dose-dependent way. After 12 h of exposure, pristimerin at all concentra- tions produced a peak of DNA fragmentation (38.43%, 68.23% and 79% for 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 lM, respectively) (Fig. 6B). 4. Discussion Various compounds derived from plant secondary metabolites are commonly used in cancer chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, camptothecin and tenoposide. Chemo- therapy has been improved over the past years, but until now, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, mainly because of side eﬀects or multi-drug resistance. Moreover, it is important to ﬁnd new molecules with activity against cancer with more speciﬁc eﬀects (Kamb, 2005). In this con- text, many researches have found bioactive metabolites in plants of the Celastraceae family with antitumor (quinon- emethide triterpens) and cytotoxic (triterpene dimers) activities (Shirota et al., 1994), which makes these com- pounds promising new anti-cancer drug candidates. In this work, we investigated the eﬀect of pristimerin iso- lated from M. ilicifolia in ﬁve human tumor cell lines (HL- 60, HCT-8, SF-295, MDA/MB-435 and K-562) and in nor- mal proliferating PBMC.

Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 action of pristimerin was further evaluated in the promyel- ocitic leukemia cell line HL-60. In the ﬁrst part of this study, pristimerin showed high cytotoxicity against all cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.55 lM (MDA/MB- 435) to 3.2 lM (K-562) after 72 h. Goncalves de Lima et al. (1971) and Setzer et al. (1998) also demonstrated that quinonemethide triterpenoids isolated from the Celastraceae family inhibits cell growth. Our study also corroborates the ﬁndings of Wu et al. (2005) showing that pristimerin inhibits cell growth of cancer cell lines: A-549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) and Hep3B (liver) with IC50 values ranging from 0.42 to 0.61 lM. In the present work, we also demonstrated that pristimerin was cytotoxic to PBMC in the same concentration range than to leukemia cells, suggesting a poor selectivity of this compound. When considering the chemotherapy side eﬀects, it is very impor- tant to verify whether the drug shows a harmful eﬀect against normal dividing cells such as proliferating lymphocytes (Zuco et al., 2002; Anazetti et al., 2003). Mammalian cells provide an excellent tool for study- ing cytotoxic substances, where the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line is one of the most often used model for this purpose (Collins, 1987; Milita˜o et al., 2006). In try- ing to identify the mechanism of action involved in the Fig. 4.

Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 859 antiproliferative eﬀects of pristimerin, we assessed changes in cell viability and morphology (induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis) and inhibition of DNA synthesis and topoisomerase activity. First, the antiproliferative action was conﬁrmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, which is a suitable and useful test to determine eﬀects on cell proliferation and viability (Renzi et al., 1993). At all concentrations tested, pristimer- in reduced the number of viable cells, which was more evi- dent at higher concentrations (0.8 and 1.7 lM). These results are consistent with the MTT ﬁndings and ﬂow cytometry. The antiproliferative eﬀects were further investigated to determine the mechanism underlying pristimerin cytotoxic- ity. DNA synthesis was aﬀected by treatment with pristim- erin at all concentrations in a dose-dependent way, with extensive cell destruction at 1.7 lM, which made quantiﬁ- cation diﬃcult. Current cancer chemotherapy drugs such as intercalating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors can inhibit DNA synthesis. This inhibition can be due to sev- eral cellular processes such as DNA topology state. More- over, topoisomerase plays an important role by altering the topological state of DNA in events such as overwinding, underwinding, and catenation, and it is involved in prolif- erative processes such as DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and chromosome segregation. We investi- gated the eﬀect of pristimerin on topoisomerase I activity, since this enzyme can be a primordial target for the action 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * * * * * * Number of viable cells 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * * * * * * Number of apoptotic cells 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * Number of necrotic cells Fig. 5.

Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 of a wide variety of anti-cancer drugs (Li and Liu, 2001). However, pristimerin was not able to inhibit human topo- isomerase I activity indicating that the antiproliferative mechanism of pristimerin is probably due to alterations in another pathway. In order to determine the mechanism of cell death, alter- ations in cell morphology were examined. Some authors have considered the distinction between apoptosis and necrosis diﬃcult and controversial. According to Masque- lier et al. (2004), the morphological deﬁnition is commonly based on membrane integrity. Dartsch et al. (2002) and Schultz and Harrington (2003) considered crucial points for distinguishing apoptosis from necrosis: an early occur- rence of nuclear and DNA fragmentation concomitant with membrane integrity, showing apoptotic bodies, phos- phatidylserine externalization, reduction of nuclear volume and chromatin condensation. Generally, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is a great beneﬁt for cancer chemo- therapy (Reddy et al., 2003). In the morphological studies, appreciable DNA frag- mentation was observed at the all doses, with highest one revealing signs of extensive destabilization of the plasma membrane with loss of integrity, reduction of cell volume and pyknotic nuclei typical of necrotic processes (Hannun, 1997; Desoize and Sen, 1992). As seen in cytometry analy- sis, pristimerin induced an increase in sub-G1 population cells, which was concentration and time-dependent, sug- gesting that cells underwent DNA fragmentation, an important hallmark of apoptosis. Moreover, in AO/EB ﬂuorescence experiments, pristimerin treated cells dis- played characteristics of apoptosis as fragmented and con- densed nuclei and a brilliant intense green ﬂuorescence, with exception of 24 h exposure at 1.7 lM, which revealed necrosis as probably the result of late apoptosis. These ﬁndings are in agreement with those reported by Wu et al. (2005) who showed that pristimerin causes apoptosis induction in MDA/MB-231 cells triggering a rapid and time-dependent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria within 0.5 h and activation of caspase-3, acting by the intrinsic pathway. In conclusion, the present data point to the importance of pristimerin, a quinonemethide triterpenoid, as representa- C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 0 20 40 60 80 100 6h 12h 24h Pristimerin * * * * * * Viable Cells (%) C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 0 20 40 60 80 100 6h 12h 24h (μM) (μM) Pristimerin * * * * * * * * * * DNA fragmentation (%) Fig. 6.

It is involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among the proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, cathepsin V is a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In the present work, natural ﬂavonoids were screened against cathepsin V, and two ﬂavones were identiﬁed as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. On the basis of this result, a combinatorial library of chalcones and ﬂavones was prepared, in solution phase employing a scavenger reagent, and fully evaluated. Introduction Coronary arterial disease is one of the major causes of human death. In this context, atherosclerosis, which is characterized by a thickening and loss of elasticity of the arterial wall, is the leading cause of cardiac illness. Cathepsin V is a papain-like cysteine protease, involved in the control of human T cells (responsible for cell immunity), and presents the largest elastolytic activity among proteolytic enzymes.1,2 It is predominantly expressed in the thymus, testicles, and epithelial corneal. Although cathepsin V can be considered a potential molecular target for the treatment of atherosclerosis, few inhibitors are described in the literature.2,3 The benzopyranone-ring system, found in ﬂavonoids, is a molecular scaffold of considerable interest, and some reports describe this class of compounds as inhibitors of cathepsin acitvity. Kenyon and co-workers reported the activity of chalcone derivatives toward the enzyme cathepsin B.4,5 Patil et al. isolated a new dimeric dihydrochalcone and a preny- lated ﬂavone from Artocarpus altilis (Moraceae) which are potent inhibitors of cathepsin K, with IC50 values of 98 and 840 nM, respectively.6 Pan et al.7 and Zeng et al.8 described biﬂavones isolated from Taxodium mucronatum (Taxodiacea) and Cycas guizhouensis (Cycadaceae) with activity against cathepsin B and K. Bauvois et al. examined the effects of synthetic ﬂavones on a number of metalloproteinases, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase as well as serine proteases such as cathepsin G.9 Medicinal chemistry efforts have focused on diversifying the benzopyranone scaffold and utilizing combinatorial chemistry approaches to construct small benzopyranone libraries.10 In the literature are described several ﬂavonoid libraries synthesized in solution phase, such as, for example, chalcones11–13 and ﬂavones.14,15 Solid-phase organic synthesis (SPOS) has long been an integral component of the synthetic repertoire employed by combinatorial chemists.16 In SPOS, solid support-bound substrates are elaborated synthetically by using an excess of reagents to drive reactions to completion. Desired products can then be isolated easily by simple ﬁltration and removed from the support material. Previous reviews have discussed the importance of combinatorial libraries of ﬂavonoids prepared by solid phase synthesis.17–19 Nicolaou et al. reported a solid-phase synthesis of a 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran motif employing a cycloloading strategy that relies on the use of a polystyrene-based selenenyl bromide resin.20 Harikrishnan and Showalter prepared a small library of isoﬂavone analogues employing a solid-supported diisopro- pylsilyloxy traceless linker.21 Cheng et al. prepared a small library of chalcones via parallel solid phase synthesis.22 A different strategy was employed by Yao et al. for the preparation of a ﬂavone library.23 A functionalized ﬂavone was prepared in solution phase by classical Claisen conden- sation, mixed acid nitration, and oxidative cyclization reac- tion with iodine-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Then, the ﬂavone was employed as scaffold for the synthesis of a combinatorial library in solid phase. Arai et al. developed an efﬁcient one-pot synthesis by Michael aldol reaction of chromone and ﬂavonoid derivatives bearing heterocyclic units.24 The 2,3-heterocyclic-substituted chromones were obtained in one step. Moreover, the use of substituted benzaldehydes and subsequent addition of heterocyclic aldehydes gave 3-pyridyl-substituted ﬂavones. They have also examined these one-pot reactions in the solid phase by attaching the acetophenone derivative to (4-methoxyphenyl)- diisopropylsilylpropyl polystyrene beads. * Towhomcorrespondenceshouldbeaddressed.E-mail:agcorrea@ufscar.br.

Chem. 2010, 12, 687–695 687 10.1021/cc100076k 2010 American Chemical Society Published on Web 06/25/2010 SPOS has many advantages but also many limiting drawbacks: it can be difﬁcult to adapt conventional solution phase chemistry to a solid-phase format, some solid-phase reactions are signiﬁcantly slower than they are when run in solution, and the progress of solid-phase reactions can be difﬁcult to monitor.11 An alternative is the use of polymer- supported reagents, catalysts, and cleanup agents (scavengers) which facilitate reactions of substrates in solution. For example, a solid-supported reagent can be used to drive to completion a coupling reaction between two reactive sub- strates, one of which is present in excess. A support-bound scavenger can then be used to remove the excess reagent, yielding pure product. Or a support-bound capture reagent can be used to remove the coupling product directly, which is then cleaved from the support.25 Bhat et al. employed a piperazinyl Merriﬁeld resin in the synthesis of a library of ﬂavones.26 Huang et al. described a solid-phase synthesis of ﬂavones employing a Lewis acid-mediated polystyrene- supported selenium induced intramolecular cyclization of chalcones.27 After the oxidative cleavage of selenium resin, the ﬂavones were obtained in good overall yields and high purity. In the present work, we describe the use of tosyl hydrazide scavenger resin in the preparation of a combinatorial library of chalcone and ﬂavone derivatives, identiﬁed as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. Results and Discussion In an ongoing program toward the development of speciﬁc, potent inhibitors of cathepsin V enzyme, several natural products were screened. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation: where Vi and V0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determined in the presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively. Among some other active compounds, a series of ﬂa- vonoids showed interesting activity at initial concentration of 25 µM. The most potent compounds were ﬂavones 1 and 2 (Figure 1), isolated from Vitex polygama (Verbenaceae)28 and Lonchocarpus subglaucescens (Leguminoseae),29 re- spectively, with IC50 ) 2.5 and 13.5 µM. The IC50 values correspond to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V, and were determined from collected data by non-linear regression analysis. On the basis of these results, a small library of ﬂavonoids waspreparedinsolutionphaseemployingtheClaisen-Schmidt condensation,30 followed by oxidative cyclization catalyzed by I2 (Scheme 1).31 The library components were obtained in moderate to good yields and were characterized by 1H NMR and MS. The compounds then were submitted to biochemical evaluation against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 1). In this small series we have already identiﬁed ﬂavone (6d) with a higher inhibition activity than the natural products 1 Figure 1. Natural ﬂavonoids evaluated against cathepsin V. Scheme 1.

To evaluate a larger number of ﬂavonoids and establish some structure-activity relationships, a ﬂavone library was prepared through parallel synthesis using the polystyrene-tosyl hydrazide (PS-Ts-NHNH2) (7) as a car- bonyl scavenging resin.32 Before carrying out the synthesis of the library some tests were realized to optimize the reaction conditions using the resin. The best results were obtained using 0.075 mmol of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxyace- tophenone, 0.1 mmol of resin 7, and 0.1 mmol of 2,4- dimethoxybenzaldehyde, at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and the presence of the aldehydes was not observed. Following the reaction conditions previously tested, a library of chalcones and ﬂavones was prepared (Scheme 2) using 4 acetophenones (3) (Figure 2) and 6 aldehydes (4) as building blocks (Figure 3). The diversity of the library was planned based on the structure of natural products 1 and 2, which are highly oxygenated, and also on the commercial availability of reagents. The reactions were carried out in 24 reaction vessels of a Bu¨chi Syncore synthesizer. Initially, for the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, to a solution containing the acetophenone 3 and the aldehyde 4 in methanol was added an aqueous solution of 50% KOH. After 3 h at 75 °C, an aqueous solution of 10% HCl was added to neutralize the mixture. Excess of aldehyde was removed from the reaction mixture by the use of resin scavenger 7 in dimethylformamide (DMF). Oxidative cyclization was carried out in DMSO at 150 °C for 1 h using iodine as catalyst. Thirteen chalcones 5 were puriﬁed by preparative TLC and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme (Table 2). As observed before, the chalcones showed no activity. The ﬂavones were puriﬁed by SPE or preparative TLC. Analyses Table 1.

Combinatorial Library of Chalcones and Flavones Journal of Combinatorial Chemistry, 2010 Vol. 12, No. 5 689 by HPLC in three different wavelengths (254, 280, and 320 nm) showed that 21 ﬂavones 6 were prepared in low to moderate yield (13-68%) and good to high purity (80-95%). All compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and the spectroscopic data were compared with those reported in the literature.33–57 The library components were submitted to biochemical evaluation (Table 3). The ﬁrst aspect of the validation of these results was the analysis of false positives. Depending on the assay design and detection method used for the screening assay, various artifacts can occur that lead to wrong results. Before performing the screening, all compounds were analyzed on a ﬂuorimeter using the test conditions without the addition of the enzyme. Flavones 6a, 6c, 6{1,2}, 6{2,4}, and 6{4,4} showed intrinsic ﬂuorescence; thus, it was not possible to verify their potency as inhibitors. Compounds that inhibited more than 50% were selected for determination of IC50 values. When diluted, ﬂavones 6{1,1}, 6{1,3}, and 6{2,1} showed ﬂuorescence above the control, suggesting that at lower concentrations these compounds may cause a confor- mational change of the protein, and it was not possible to observe the ﬂuorescence quenching, thus interfering with the response of the test. Most of the ﬂavones showed signiﬁcant inhibition with IC50 values varying in the range of 0.8-25.1 µM. Primary studies on the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the ﬂavonoids suggest the importance of the ring C. Interestingly the chalcones exhibited lower inhibition in a unique con- centration demonstrating that cyclization to form the C ring is relevant to interaction between enzyme site and inhibitor. We also observed that among the most potent compounds, ﬂavones 6d, 6{3,1}, and 6{3,2} (IC50 ) 1.2, 0.8, and 1.6 µM, respectively) possess one halogen (bromine or ﬂuorine) as substituent in the A ring and methoxy groups in the C ring. In conclusion, despite the lack of a detailed experimental enzyme-inhibitor complex, from the natural products screen- ing, we have been able to identify synthetic ﬂavones with increased potency. These results indicate the potential of this class as promising inhibitors of cathepsin V. To further investigate these results and thus generate useful data for the computer aided molecular design, modeling studies are being performed through docking protocol. 3. Experimental Section All commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Reagents and solvents were puriﬁed when necessary according to the usual procedures described in the literature. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-200 (200 and 50 MHz respectively). The IR spectra refer to ﬁlms and were measured on a Bomem M102 spectrometer. Mass Spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on a 0.25 µm ﬁlm of silica gel containing ﬂuorescent indicator UV254 supported on an aluminum sheet (Sigma-Aldrich). Flash column chromatography was per- formed using silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 230-400 mesh, E. Merck). Gas chromatography was performed in a Shimadzu GC-17A with H2 as carrier and using a DB-5 column. Solid- phase extraction (SPE) was carried out using silica cartridges (Phenomenex Strata Silica SL-1, 500 mg, 6 mL). HPLC analyses were performed in Shimadzu equipment with a LC- 20AT pump, SIL-10A injector, SPD-20A detector, and in a Phenomenex column Luna C18(2) 5 µm (150 × 4.6 mm).

Synthesis of the Combinatorial Library of Flavones 6. In 24 reaction vessels of a Bu¨chi Syncore synthesizer was placed a solution of acetophenone 3{1-4} (0.075 mmol) and aldehyde 4{1-6} (0.10 mmol) (Figure 2) in methanol (2.0 mL). Then it was added an aqueous solution of KOH 50% (150 µL). The mixture was stirred at 75 °C for 3 h, and then an aqueous solution of HCl 10% (750 µL) was added. The solvent was evaporated, then ethyl acetate (3 mL) was added and the organic layer was transferred to another vessel. This procedure was repeated three times and then concentrated under vacuum. Then DMF (1 mL) was added followed by PS-Ts-NHNH2 (7) (50 mg, 0.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, then it was washed with methylene chloride (3 mL), and the organic layer was transferred to another vessel. This procedure was repeated three times; then the solvent was evaporated furnishing chalcones 5. One third was separated for further character- ization and bioassays. To the previously prepared chalcones 5 was added a 1 mg/mL solution of iodine in DMSO (1 mL). The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 150 °C, and then an aqueous solution of 0.1 M sodium thiosulfate (0.1 mL) was added. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum, and the crude product was puriﬁed by SPE using silica gel (500 mg) and methylene chloride: ethyl acetate (8:2) or preparative TLC using hexane: ethyl acetate (8:2) as eluent. The ﬂavones 6 were analyzed by HPLC (see Table 3), characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and evaluated against cathepsin V enzyme. 4′-Benzyloxy-2′-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone (5{1,1}).37 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.86 (s, 3H); 5.11 (s, 2H); 6.47-6.62 (m, 2H); 6.94 (d, J ) 8.6 Hz, 2H); 7.30-7.53 (m, 6H); 7.61 (d, J ) 8.6 Hz, 2H); 7.82 (d, J ) 2.8 Hz, 1H); 7.88 (d, J ) 8.7 Hz, 1H); 13.52 (s, 1H). 4′-Benzyloxi-2′-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethoxychalcone (5{1,3}).38 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.90 (s, 3H); 3.92 (s, 3H); 3.97 (s, 3H); 5,11 (s, 2H); 6.50-6.62 (m, 2H); 6.73 (d, J ) 8.9 Hz, 1H); 7.31-7.52 (m, 6H); 7.63 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 7.78-7.90 (m, 1H); 8.05 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 13.56 (s, 1H). 4′-Benzyloxy-2′-hydroxy-4-triﬂuoromethoxychal- cone (5{1,4}). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 5.12 (s, 2H); 6.52-6.64 (s, 2H); 7.25-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.35-7.47 (m, 5H); 7.54 (J ) 15.5 Hz, 1H); 7.63-7.75 (m, 2H); 7.84 (d, J ) 9.5 Hz, 1H); 7.86 (J ) 15.5 Hz, 1H); 13.32 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-4,4′,6′-trimethoxychalcone (5{2,1}):39 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.84 (s, 3H); 3.85 (s, 3H); 3.92 (s, 3H); 5.97 (d, J ) 2.4, 1H); 6.11 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.87-7.02 (m, 2H); 7.51-7.63 (m, 2H); 7.80 (s, 2H); 14.40 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-2,4,4′,6′-tetramethoxychalcone (5{2,2}).40 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.83 (s, 3H); 3.86 (s, 3H); 3.90 (s, 3H); 3.91 (s, 3H); 5.96 (dd, J ) 2.4, 0.2 Hz, 1H); 6.10 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.47 (dd, J ) 2.4, 0.3 Hz, 1H); 6.53 (ddd, J ) 8.5, 2.3, 0.3 Hz, 1H); 7.55 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, 1H); 7.90 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 8.11 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 14.54 (s, 1H). 2′-Hydroxy-2,3,4,4′,6′-pentamethoxychalcone (5{2,3}).41 1H NMR(200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.84 (s, 3H); 3.89 (s, 3H); 3.91 (s, 3H); 3.95 (s, 3H); 5.96 (d, J ) 2.4, 1H); 6.11 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz, 1H); 6.72 (d, J ) 8.8 Hz, 1H); 7.35 (d, J ) 8.8 Hz, 1H); 7.90 (d, J ) 15.8 Hz, 1H); 8.02 (d, J ) 15.8 Hz, 1H); 14.44 (s, 1H). 4-Phenyl-2′-hydroxy-4′,6′-dimethoxychalcone (5{2,6}). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.85 (s, 3H); 3.94 (s, 3H); 5.98 (d, J ) 2.3 Hz, 1H); 6.12 (d, J ) 2.3 Hz, 1H); 7.35-7.55 (m, 3H); 7.57-7.75 (m, 6H); 15.65 (d, J ) 15.7 Hz, 1H); 7.96 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 14.32 (s, 1H). 5′-Fluoro-2′-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone (5{3,1}).42 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.88 (s, 3H); 6.91-7.06 (m, 3H); 7.17-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.42 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 7.52-7.2 (m, 3H); 7.93 (d, J ) 15.4 Hz, 1H); 12.65 (s, 1H). 5′-Fluoro-2′-hydroxy-2,4-dimethoxychalcone (5{3,2}). mp 106-107 °C. 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.87 (s, 3H); 3.93 (s, 3H); 6.48 (d, J ) 2.2 Hz, 1H); 6.55 (dd, J ) 8.5, 2.2 Hz, 1H); 6.97 (dd, J ) 9.0, 4.8 Hz, 1H); 7.14-7.32 (m, 1H); 7.52-7.67 (m, 3H); 8.18 (d, J ) 15.6 Hz, 1H); 12.81 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 55.5; 55.6; 692 Journal of Combinatorial Chemistry, 2010 Vol. 12, No. 5 Alvim, Jr. et al. 98.5; 105.7; 114.5 (d, J ) 23.1 Hz); 116.7; 117.5; 119.6 (d, J ) 7.0 Hz); 119.9 (d, J ) 6.2 Hz); 123.2 (d, J ) 23.5 Hz); 131.8; 142.2; 154.8 (d, J ) 237.5 Hz); 159.6 (d, J ) 1.6 Hz); 160.9; 163.7; 193 (d, J ) 2.8 Hz).

Inhibitory Activity Assay. Recombinant human cathepsin V was expressed and puriﬁed as described previously.57 The molar concentration of this enzyme was determined by active site titration with E-64. Kinetic measurements were carried out in a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX GEMINI XS. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO, and the inhibitors were screened against the cathe- psin V at initial concentration of 25 µM. The protease inhibitor activity was carried out in triplicate in 96-well black plate with the method previously described by Barret et al.58 The reaction mixture contained 192 µL of a sodium acetate buffer (100 mM, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTE, pH 5.5), 2 µL of 1 mM Z-Phe-Arg-MCA, 5 µL of sample, and 1 µL of cathepsin V (32 nM). The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE at 27 °C, after the solution was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The substrate was added to start the reaction, and the ﬂuorescence of 4-methyl-7- coumaryl-amide (release MCA) was measured at Ex 355 nm and Em 460 nm. Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the E-64 (positive control), an irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase. Values of IC50 were determined by making rate measurements for at least seven inhibitor concentrations. Kinetics parameters were determined from collected data employing the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. References and Notes (1) Yasuda, Y.; Li, Z.; Greenbaum, D.; Bogyo, M.; Weber, E.; Bro¨mme, D.

Vieira, and Sakae Komatsu Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natural Resources, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720 Three anacardic acids (1-3) have been isolated as cytotoxic agents against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells from the cashew Anacardium occidentale (Anacardiaceae) apple juice. In addition to these anacardic acids, the cytotoxicity of their 13 congeners (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut and nut shell oil has also been examined. Anacardic acids (1-4), cardols (5-81, and methylcardols (9-12) have been found to exhibit moderate cytotoxic activity against both BT-20 breast and HeLa epithelioid cervix carcinoma cells. INTRODUCTION We now control many tumors with available antitumor agents. However, the need for new antitumor agents still exists, especially against solid tumors. The unacceptable and undesired side effects of many antitumor agents are a major problem that needs to be improved, due to the need for the antitumor agents to be used for long durations. It seems that edible plants may be a good source of new antitumor agents. With this in mind, we have screened for new antitumor agents from various tropical fruits and vegetables that have been continuously consumed by many people for many years. In recent years the cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) (Anacardiaceae) apple has increased in value, especially in the countries where it is grown, such as Brazil. There is no doubt that the nut is the most important product of the cashew tree. However, this tree also yields the pear- shaped \"apple\" to which the nut is attached. The cashew apple is very sour and astringent until fully ripe, when it becomes edible. In contrast to the nut, the apple was neglected until recently, although it is available in far greater tonnage. A number of processes have now been developed for converting the cashew apple into various products such as juice, jam, syrup, chutney, and beverage (Winterhalter, 1991). Cashew apple juice is, in fact, one of the most popular juices in Brazil today. In our continuing search for prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors from tropical plants (Kubo et al., 1987) we began to test their antitumor activity, since many prostaglandin- related compounds exhibited potent antitumor activity (Zenser et al., 1980; Powles et al., 1982). Our preliminary screening has found the cashew (A. occidentale) apple juice to show significant (EDXI <20 pg/mL) in vitro cytotoxicity against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells. The active principles from a regularly imbibed beverage such as cashew apple juice may be superior as antitumor agents as compared to many nonnatural products. This paper deals with the identification of cytotoxic principles of cashew apple juice. MATERIALS AND METHODS General. UV spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 100-80 spectrophotometer in ethanol. IR spectra were acquired on a Perkin-Elmer 1310 IR in KBr. NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL GX-400 (400 MHz for lH and 100 MHz for l3C) in CDCl,. EIMS were acquired on a JEOL DX-303HF by direct inlet 70 eV. Recycle HPLC (R-HPLC) was performed on a LC-09 (Japan Analytical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) (Kubo and Nakatsu, 1991). Chemicals. The phenolic compounds 1-16 (Figure 1) used for bioassay were from our previous study (Kubo et al., 1986). However, the repurification of some of them was achieved by R-HPLC. Anethole was isolated from the seeds of Pimpinella anisum (Umbelliferae) as previously described (Kubo and Himejima, 1991). Indole, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), vitamin C, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo- lium bromide (M'M') were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Plant Materials. Suco de Caju, a commercial cashew apple juice (Maguary and Milani) was purchased at market places in SHo Paulo, SHo Carlos, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Cell Lines and Media. The cell lines BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma isolated from human, and HeLa ATCC CCL 219, epithelioid cervix carcinoma cell from human, used for the assay were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with nonessential amino acids supple- mented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO1-95 % air at 37 \"C. Thehumanmonolayer culture weresubculturedwitha0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution. Cytotoxic Assay. The cytotoxic assays were performed according to a microculture tetrazolium (MTT) method (Car- michaelet d., 1987). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtiter plates at 4000-6000 celldwell, with various concentrations of the samples. After incubation, 50 Fg/mL MTT (3 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The form- dye was solubilized by adding 100 pg/mL DMSO to each well, followed by gentle shaking. The extinction coefficient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photometer Labsystem, at a wavelength of 620 nm. Combination Study. The combination data were obtained according to the checkerboard method (Norden et al., 1979). Thus, a series of the 2-fold dilutions of anacardic acid (1) was tested in combination with 2-fold dilutions of the other (anethole, indole, BHA, and vitamin C) (Figure 2). Each compound was tested at least twice. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The cytotoxicity-guided fractionation using BT-20 breast carcinoma cells has led to the isolation of three active principles from the cashew (A. occidentale) apple by R-HPLC using an ODS Cle column. The active compounds were identified by means of spectroscopic methods as anacardic acids, more specifically, 6-[8(Z),- 11 (2) ,1Cpentadecatrienyllsalicylic acid (11, 6- [8(2),11- (2)-pentadecadienyllsalicylic acid (21, and 6- [8(Z)-pen- tadecenyl] salicylic acid (3). These nonisoprenoid alkyl side chain phenolic compounds were previously isolated from the cashew (A. occidentale) nut shell oil together 0021-856 11931 1441-10 12$04.00/0 1993 Amerlcan Chemlcal Soclety Antkumor Agents from Cashew J.

Similar nonisoprenoid long-chain phe- nols including anacardic acid (3) were isolated as antitumor agents against Sarcoma ascites in mice from the sarcotesta of Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) (Itokawa et al., 1987). In addition to the 3 above-mentioned anacardic acids (1-3) isolated from the cashew apple, 13 additional phenolic compounds (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut and cashew nut shell oil (Tyman, 1979) were also examined for comparison purposes. They were first assayed against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells at 10 pg/mL. As a result, anacardic acids (1-4), cardols (5-81, and methylcardol(9- 12) exhibited significant cytotoxicity. Interestingly, car- danols (13-16) did not demonstrate significant activity against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells, although 5-[8(2),- 11(Z),14-pentadecatrienyllresorcinol (5) was previously reported to exhibit potent antitumor activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (Itokawa et al., 1987). The EDm values of the phenolic compounds (1-12) were first obtained against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells (Table I). Then, only the active compounds (EDm < 10 pg/mL) were tested against HeLa epitheloidid cervix carcinoma cells. The most effective cytotoxicity was observed for the cardols, followed by the anacardic acids and then the 1014 J. Agric. FoodChem., Vol. 41, No. 6, 1993 B H A Kubo et el.

In ai lition to the natura. phenolic com- pounds (1-16), salicylic acid (17) and resorcinol (18) were also tested. Neither salicylic acid nor resorcinol exhibited any activity against these two carcinoma cells at this concentration. By comparison of salicylic acid (17) and resorcinol (18) with the corresponding anacardic acids (1- 4) and cardols (5-81, it seems that the addition of a CIS alkyl side chain plays an important role in increasing the cytotoxicity. In fact, logP (as the hydrophobic parameter) of long-chain phenols was found to be one of the most important factors for the EDm values against Chinese hamster V-79 cells (Itokawa et al., 1989). Moreover, all of the phenolic compounds isolated from the cashew (nut, apple, and nut shell oil) have a CU alkyl side chain with up to three double bonds. In the previous investigation of their molluscicidal and antimicrobial activities, an increase in the number of double bonds in the side chain, in general, increases the biological activity (Gellerman et al., 1969; Himejima and Kubo, 1991; Kubo et al., 1986). However, this seems not to be the case in the cytotoxic activity, although the phenolics possessing a CIS saturated alkyl side chain were found to be somehow less cytotoxic than the ones with a CIS unsaturated alkylgroup. Although the cytotoxicity of these phenolics may not be potent enough to use them as a leading compound for drug design, they are worthy of further investigation as natural producta isolated from a daily beverage. Therefore, the enhancement of their cytotoxicity by combining them with other substances was studied. The procedure for selecting these \"other substances\" is, however, still in a preliminary stage. The initial selection of other substances was based largely on our previous combination studies of antimicrobial agents. For example, the antifungal activity of polygodial against a filamentous fungus Candida albicans was enhanced 32-fold by combining it with sublethal amounts of anethole (Kubaand Himejima, 1991). Similarly, the antibacterial activity of crinitol against a cariogenic bactarium Streptococcus mutans was increased 64fold by BHT (Kubo et al., 1992a), and that of 6-cadinene was enhanced 128-fold by indole (Kubo et al., 1992b). Vitamin C was also added for the combination study because of its high content in the cashew apple. Thus, the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content in the cashew apple is reported to be greater than 6 times that for oranges (Cecchi and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981). Moreover, vitamin C (anti- oxidant) was found to increase the antifungal activity of both polygodial and warburganal 16-fold against a der- matomycotic fungus Pityrosporum ouale (Kubo and Himejima, 1992). Since these four compounds have been used as food additives, we can assume that their safety has been established. For the combination study, 6-[8(2),11(2),14-pentade- catrienyllsalicylic acid (I), otherwise known as anacardic acid, was selected for the following reasons: (1) it has been isolated from the edible cashew apple; (2) its ED60 values against the two human solid tumor (BT-20 breast and HeLa epitheloidid cervix) cells are less than 4 pg/mL, that is, it satisfies the NCI requirement to warrant further investigation; and (3) most importantly for conducting this experiment, it is available in quantity. Anacardic acid (1) was, therefore, combined with anethole, BHA, indole, and vitamin C, respectively. The combination study was carried out against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells by the checkerboard method (Norden et al., 1979). In contrast to the antimicrobial activity, none of these four compounds dramatically increased the cytotoxicity of anacardic acid (1). Their effect was only additive. As an example, the combination study of anacardic acid (1) with BHA by the checkerboard method is shown in Figure 2. The total yield of the antitumor anacardic acids (1-3) in the freeze-dried cashew apple juice was reported at about 0.05% (Kubo et al., 1986). In addition to these anacardic acids, the high content of vitamin C in the cashew apple is described above (Cecchi and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981). Together with previous papers (Kubo et al., 1987; Itokawa et al., 1987), these datasuggest that consuming the cahsew apple and/or ita products continuously for long durations may be advantageous in controlling tumors.

The MeOH extract of leaves of Iryanthera juruensis, one of the plants endemic to the Amazon region and consumed in Brazil, and the hexane extract from its seeds inhibited lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2)) enzymes in in vitro assays. Further analyses of these extracts yielded 5-deoxyflavones (1-5) from the leaf extract and sargachromenol (6), sargaquinoic acid (7), a novel juruenolic acid (8), ω-arylalkanoic acids (9a-c), and the lignan guaiacin (10) from the seed extract. Compounds 3-5 inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88% at 10 ppm, respectively, and compounds 6 and 9a-c showed inhibition at 76% and 78% at 100 ppm, respectively. However, compounds 7 and 8 were inactive and lignan 10 exhibited LPO inhibitory activity by 99% at 100 ppm compared to commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and vitamin E. The flavones 1-5 also inhibited COX-1 and -2 enzymes by 50-65% at 100 ppm. Compound 6 showed high but nonselective inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, when compared to aspirin and Celebrex, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Compounds 7 and 10 inhibited COX-1 by 60% and 65% and COX-2 by 37% and 18%, respectively, whereas compounds 8 and 9a-c showed little or no activity against these enzymes. KEYWORDS: Iryanthera juruensis; Myristicaceae; lipid peroxidation; cyclooxygenase; flavone; tocotrienol; ω-arylalkanoic acids; lignan INTRODUCTION Plants from Myristicaceae family have been traditionally used as food supplements by South American Indians. The anecdotal health benefits of these plants are implicated in healing stomach infections and wounds and for inducing central nervous system (CNS) alterations when used during religious ceremonies. The Iryanthera species are endemic to the Amazon region and their crushed leaves were reported to heal infected wounds and cuts. Also, the latex from the barks, mixed with warm water, was used for treating infections (1). The seeds of Iryanthera species are valued in Brazil for their high yield in fatty acids, which also explains their general designation as “ucu-uba”, or fat- producing tree. The protein-rich aril and roasted seeds as well as beverages prepared from the crushed leaves of Iryanthera are consumed by native people in the Amazon region. The major constituent in the seeds of Iryanthera species is myristic acid, a C14 fatty acid. It usually co-occurs with antioxidant toco- trienols and is extensively used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries (2). In the course of our systematic studies on Iryanthera species, we have demonstrated the presence of antioxidant tocotrienols, flavonoids, and flavonolignans in fruits and leaves of Iryanthera grandis, Iryanthera lancifolia, Iryan- thera sagotiana, and Iryanthera juruensis (3-7). Oxidative damage to the cell membrane and its components is the initial event in several human disease processes, including cancer and atherosclerosis. Iryanthera spp. are known for their health benefits and hence we have continued the search for natural antioxidants in this plant species. It is a popular notion that regular consumption of antioxidant compounds imparts beneficial effects to biological systems and that such compounds act as chemopreventive agents. It has been established that compounds with radical scavenging activity are beneficial to health since they induce detoxifying enzymes (8, 9). As part of ongoing projects aimed at the discovery of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora [Biota-FAPESP (www.biotasp.org.br) and BIOprospecTA (www.bioprospecta.org. br)], the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of 56 plant extracts have been examined by means of in vitro assays measuring the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and * Corresponding author: fax +1-517-432-2310; e-mail nairm@msu.edu. † Sa˜o Paulo State University. ‡ Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals, Michigan State Uni- versity. § Center for Human Nutrition, University of California at Los Angeles.

The methanol and hexane extracts of I. juruensis leaves and seeds, respectively, were subjected to bioassay-directed chro- matographic purification. This paper presents the comparative LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities of the pure isolates and of crude extracts along with commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and vitamin E, as well as clinically used antiinflam- matory agents aspirin and Celebrex. Also, this is the first report of flavones 1-5 from I. juruensis and of the novel juruenolic acid (8). MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedures. UV and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B and a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1750 spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR spectra [1H, 13C, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experi- ments] were measured on Varian INOVA (300 MHz) and VRX (500 MHz) instruments. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to residual proton signals of CDCl3 at 7.24 and DMSO-d6 at 2.50. Coupling constants, J, are in Hertz. 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to residual 13C signals of CDCl3 at 77.0 and DMSO-d6 at 39.5. Standard pulse sequences were employed for all 1D [1H, 13C, and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)] and 2D (COSY, HMBC, and HMQC) NMR experiments. Mass spectra were recorded at the Michigan State University mass spectrometry facility on a JEOL HX- 110 double-focusing mass spectrometer (Peabody, MA) operating in the positive ion mode for fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and high-resolution (HR) FABMS experiments. Merck silica gel (60 mesh size, 35-70 µm) with particle size of 60 µm was used for preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). For preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation, 250, 500, and 1000 µm silica gel plates (Analtech, Inc., Newark, DE) were used. TLC plates were viewed under UV light at 254 and 366 nm or sprayed with 10% sulfuric acid solution. Solvents were of ACS reagent grade and were purchased from Spectrum Chemical Co. (Gardena, CA). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), R-tocopherol, dimethyl sul- foxide (DMSO), and acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Celebrex was a physician professional sample. 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine was pur- chased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and 3-[p-(6- phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl]phenylpropionic acid was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were prepared in the Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals Laboratory (BNPP) from ram seminal vesicles and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2), from cloned insect cell lysate, respectively (12). Plant Material and Extract Preparation. Leaves and fruits of I. juruensis were collected in Reserva do Mocambo, in the Amazon forest in January during the rainy season, and identified as Iryanthera juruensis Warburg by botanist Nelson Rosa. A voucher specimen, ID 141860 MG, was deposited at the Herbarium Joa˜o Murc¸a Pires at Museu Paraense Emı´lio Goeldi (Bele´m, PA, Brazil). The dried and ground leaves (111 g) and seeds (53 g) were extracted separately with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol at room temperature, using 3 × 300 mL of each solvent for extraction of leaves and 3 × 130 mL of each solvent for extraction of seeds. Solvents were removed under vacuum by use of a rotary evaporator and afforded the crude extracts hexane (1.4 g), EtOAc (1.8 g), and MeOH (6.4 g) from leaves and hexane (13.5 g), EtOAc (14.1 g), and MeOH (3.3 g) from seeds. Isolation of Constituents. The MeOH extract from the leaves of I. juruensis (3.2 g) was stirred with CHCl3 and filtered to remove the precipitate (1.5 g). The CHCl3-soluble part of this extract was concentrated (1.7 g) and subjected to MPLC on silica gel. Elution with hexane/acetone (H/A) solvent system under gradient conditions (H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL) afforded 11 fractions (A1-A3, 100 mL each; A4- A6, 200 mL each; A7, 300 mL; A8 and A9, 250 mL each; and A10 and A11, 200 mL each). Fraction A7 was precipitated with acetone and gave pure compound 3 (17 mg) as a pale yellow precipitate. The acetone-soluble portion was concentrated (240 mg) and was further chromatographed on a silica gel MPLC column with CHCl3/MeOH (C/M) under gradient conditions (CHCl3 100%, 100 mL; C/M 99:1, 100 mL; C/M 49:1, 200 mL; C/M 19:1, 300 mL; C/M 9:1, 200 mL; C/M 4:1, 200 mL; C/M 3:1, 100 mL; C/M 1:1, 100 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) to give 12 fractions (B1-B3, 100 mL each; B4-B5, 150 mL each; B6-B11, 100 mL each; B12, 200 mL). Fractions B2-B4 were combined on the basis of their comparative TLC profiles and submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 19:1 v/v) to give compounds 1 (2.6 mg, Rf 0.5) and 2 (2.2 mg, Rf 0.4). Similarly, silica gel MPLC of fractions A8-A10 (340 mg) eluted with CHCl3/MeOH solvent systems (CHCl3 100%, 100 mL; C/M 99:1, 200 mL; C/M 49:1, 300 mL; C/M 19:1, 400 mL; C/M 9:1, 300 mL; C/M 4:1, 200 mL; C/M 3:1, 100 mL; C/M 1:1, 100 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) afforded 13 fractions (C1 and C2, 200 mL each; C3 and C4, 100 mL each; C5-C10, 150 mL each; C11-C13, 100 mL each). Preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 9:1 v/v) of fraction C6 yielded compounds 4 (6 mg, Rf 0.4) and 5 (4 mg, Rf 0.3). The hexane extract of seeds (5.1 g) was stirred with hot MeOH and was filtered. The MeOH-soluble fraction was concentrated (2.7 g) and subjected to MPLC purification on silica gel with hexane/acetone (H/ A) as the mobile phase under gradient conditions (H/A 49:1, 200 mL; H/A 19:1, 200 mL; H/A 9:1, 400 mL; H/A 4:1, 400 mL; H/A 7:3, 400 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) to afford 28 fractions (D1 and D2, 200 mL each; D3-D6, 100 mL each; D7-D14, 50 mL each; D15- D21, 100 mL each; D22-D25, 50 mL each; D26-D28, 200 mL each). Fraction D12 was precipitated with hexane to give compounds 9a-c (56 mg) as a white precipitate. Fractions D16-D18 (149 mg) were combined and further submitted to MPLC (hexane/acetone gradient: H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; acetone 100%, 100 mL) to afford five fractions (E1 and E2, 250 mL each; E3-E5, 300 mL each); preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH, 49:1, v/v) of fraction E4 afforded compound 8 (10 mg, Rf 0.3). Fractions D22-D24 (1.26 g) were pooled and also submitted to MPLC (hexane/acetone gradient: H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 7:3, 400 mL; H/A 3:1, 400 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 300 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL) to afford nine fractions (F1-F3, 300 mL each; F4-F9, 200 mL each), which gave compounds 6 (44 mg) and 7 (18 mg) as brown oils from fractions F8 and F3, respectively. Preparative TLC (hexane/acetone 3:1 v/v) of fraction F6 gave compound 10 (26 mg, Rf 0.4). 2-(4′-Methylpentenyl-3)-10-oxoundecan-2,6-dienoic acid (juruenolic acid, 8): Pale yellow oil; UV λmaxMeOH nm (ϵ): 246 (3800).

Antioxidant Assays: â-Carotene Assay. TLC plates were developed in appropriate solvent systems. After developing and drying, TLC plates were sprayed with a 0.02% solution of â-carotene (Aldrich) in MeOH. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background (10). Each plant extract was tested in two elution systems (CHCl3/ MeOH, 9:1 v/v, and CHCl3/MeOH/H2O, 13:6:1 v/v/v) for observation of low-, medium-, and high-polarity compounds. The yellow spots retained on the TLC plates indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the extracts tested. Lipoperoxidation Inhibition Assay. These antioxidant bioassays were conducted by analysis of model liposome oxidation by use of fluorescence spectroscopy (11). The lipid, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn- glycerol-3-phosphocholine (5 µmol), and fluorescent probe, 3-[p-(6- phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl]-phenylpropionic acid (5 µmol), were com- bined in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dried under vacuum at room temperature. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were produced by resuspension of the lipid-probe mixture [0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.01 M 3-(N-morpholino)- propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) maintained over Chelex 100 resin] followed by 10 freeze-thaw cycles in a dry ice-EtOH bath and 2570 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 55, No. 7, 2007 Silva et al. extrusion (29 times) through a 100 nm pore size membrane. The final assay volume was 2 mL, consisting of 100 µL of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)- piperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer [50 mM HEPES and 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)], 200 µL of 1 M NaCl, 1.64 mL of N2-sparged Millipore purified water, 20 µL of test sample or DMSO (solvent control), and a 20-µL aliquot of liposome suspension. Peroxidation was initiated by addition of 20 µL of FeCl2· 4H2O (0.5 mM) to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM Fe2+. The positive controls BHA, BHT, and R-tocopherol/vitamin E were tested at a final concentration of 10 µM. Fluorescence was measured at 384 nm and monitored at 0, 1, and 3 min and every 3 min thereafter up to 21 min on a Turner model 450 digital fluorometer (Barnstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA). The decrease of relative fluorescence intensity with time indicated the rate of peroxidation. Relative fluorescence (Ft/F0) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence value at a given time t (Ft) by that at t ) 0 min (F0). Cyclooxygenase Enzymes Inhibitory Assay. COX-1 enzyme inhibi- tory assay was conducted with an enzyme preparation from ram seminal vesicles (ca. 0.46 mg of protein/mL in 30 mM Tris buffer, pH 7). COX-2 activity was determined by using a preparation from insect cell lysate and diluting with Tris buffer (pH 7) to give an approximate final concentration of 1.5 mg protein/mL (12, 13). COX assays were measured at 37 °C by observing the initial rate of O2 uptake with a micro oxygen chamber and electrode (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) attached to a YSI model 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instrument, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Each assay mix contained 0.6 mL of 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7), 1 mmol of phenol, and 17 µg of hemoglobin. For each test compound (100 ppm) or standards in DMSO (10 µL), activities were determined following a 2-10 min preincubation of samples with enzyme COX-1 or COX-2 (10-20 µL) in the assay chamber. Celebrex (1.7 ppm) and aspirin (108 ppm) were used as positive controls in this assay. Different concentra- tions of standards used were due to their difference in inhibitory activities and also to achieve a uniform enzyme inhibition at 50%. Reaction was initiated by adding arachidonic acid (10 µL of a 1.64 µM solution). Data were recorded with Quicklog for Windows data acquisition software (Strawberry Tree Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We have evaluated 158 Brazilian plant extracts by TLC for the presence of antioxidant compounds (unpublished data) by spraying the developed TLC plates with â-carotene solution followed by exposure to natural light (10). The results indicated the presence of antioxidants in 56 extracts, based on the observation of persistent yellow spots after exposure of the plates to natural light (10). These 56 plant extracts were then evaluated for their LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities. On the basis of the bioassay results, the methanol and hexane extracts of I. juruensis leaves and seeds, respectively, were selected for the isolation of bioactive compounds. In summary, the chro- matographic purification of the leaf-extract afforded 5-deoxy- flavones (1-5) and the seeds extract gave sargachromenol (6), sargaquinoic acid (7), the novel juruenolic acid (8), ω-arylal- kanoic acids (9a-c), and guaiacin (10). The identification of isolates was based mostly on NMR, UV, and MS spectral analysis and comparison with literature data. Compounds 1-5 belonged to the class of flavones lacking a 5-oxy substituent, which was confirmed by the signal at ca. δ 7.90 (d, J ∼8.0 Hz), assigned to H-5, in their 1H NMR spectra. The position of -OCH3 groups in flavones 3 and 4 was established by UV spectral analysis with NaOAc/MeOH and NaOMe/MeOH as shift reagents for determination of the substitution patterns in rings A (band I) and B (band II), respectively (14, 15). Also, the NMR data of these compounds were identical to the reported chemical shift values and further confirmed their identities. Therefore, compound 1 was identified as 7,4′-dimethoxyflavone and was formerly isolated from Virola, a widely occurring neotropical Myristicaceae genus (16), whereas compound 3 was identified as tithonine, previously isolated from Tithonia (Asteraceae) (17). Compounds 2 and 4, identified as fasciculiferin and farnisine, respectively, were reported from Acacia fasciculifera and Acacia farnesiana (Fabaceae) (18, 19). Similarly, compound 5 was identified as 7,4′-dihydroxyflavone, reported from Pterocarpus marsupium (20). The structures of sargachromenol (6) and sargaquinoic acid (7) were also confirmed by NMR and MS spectral analyses. These compounds have been isolated earlier from brown seaweeds from the genera Sargassum and Stipopodium (21, 22) and as repeated isolates from I. juruensis (7). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 8 showed signals for four methyl groups on sp2 carbons at δ 1.59, 1.62, 1.68, and 2.13, which showed correlations to signals at δ 17.7, 15.8, 25.6, and 29.9, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. A triplet at δ 5.98, integrated for one proton, and a multiplet at δ 5.09 for two protons were observed in its 1H NMR spectrum. The 13C NMR signal at δ 172.0, assigned to an R,â-unsaturated carboxyl, and at δ 123.0, 130.0, 132.0, 135.0, and 145.6, assigned to olefinic carbons of an isoprene chain, suggested a partial structure similar to the side chain in compounds 6 and 7. An Bioactive Constituents in Iryanthera juruensis J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 55, No. 7, 2007 2571 additional signal at δ 208.0, which showed HMBC correlation with the singlet at δ 2.13 and the triplet at δ 2.45, indicated a methyl-carbonyl-methylene moiety in the structure of 8 (Figure 1). Also, one quartet at δ 2.60, two triplets at δ 2.08 and 2.11, integrated for two protons each, and one multiplet at δ 2.26, integrated for four protons, were assigned to the allyl-methylene protons. The HMBC correlation between H1′ (δ 2.26) and C1 (COOH, δ 172.6), in addition to correlations of H8 (δ 2.27) to C6 (δ 130.6) and to C10 (CdO, δ 208.8) indicated the position of -COOH moiety at C2. Additional COSY (Figure 2) and HMBC correlations led to the complete assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR signals (Table 1). HRFABMS and FABMS analysis showed peaks at 293.2116 [M + H+] and 585 [2M + H+], respectively, which confirmed the molecular formula as C18H28O3, whereas peaks at m/z 69 and 165 in the FAB mass spectrum (positive ion mode) were assigned to the isopentenyl (C5H9) moiety and to the ion resulting from the loss of isopentenyl and carboxyl moieties [M - C5H9 - COOH]+, respectively. Therefore, the spectral data gave conclusive support to the establishment of the structure of the new compound 8 as 2-(4′-methylpentenyl-3)-10-oxoundecan-2,6-dienoic acid. ω-Arylalkanoic acids 9a-c were identified on the basis of their UV, 1H and 13C NMR, and FABMS spectra and are probably biosynthetic precursors of γ-lactones known as jurue- nolides, which occur widely in Iryanthera species (7, 23). Compound 10 was identified from its spectroscopic data and by comparison with literature values as guaiacin, an aryltetralin lignan, previously isolated from Guaiacum officinale (Zygo- phyllaceae) (24, 25). Flavonoids are by far the most investigated class of natural products regarding antioxidant properties. The aromatic -OH groups and the C2-C3 double bond are some of the features of flavonoids important for their antioxidant activity (26). Flavones 3-5 showed lipoperoxidation inhibition by 95% when tested at 100 ppm. At lower concentration (10 ppm), they were still highly active (Figure 3) and inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88%, respectively. This suggested that flavones 3-5 offer better protection of lipid membranes from oxidation than sargachromenol (6) or sargaquinoic acid (7). Flavones 1-5 also showed moderate inhibition of COX enzymes. However, the COX-1 enzyme was inhibited the most, by 40-65%, compared to COX-2 enzyme (Figure 4). At 100 ppm, flavones 1 and 2 inhibited COX-2 enzyme by 31% and 51%, respectively, whereas flavones 3-5 showed <20% inhibition. This activity profile might be dependent on their polarity as well as the substitution pattern in ring B. For example, flavones 1 and 2 are fully methoxylated compounds, whereas compounds 3-5 contained free -OH groups in their structures. Moreover, the substitution pattern in ring B seemed to play a major role in determining the COX-2 enzyme activity, as the presence of a 3′,4′-dimethoxy ring B rendered the highest enzyme inhibitory activity among flavones 1-5 tested. Also, lack of a methoxy group in ring B led to a reduction in the activity as shown by flavone 5. The presence of either a 7-OMe or 7-OH group in ring A seemed to be of lesser impact on COX-2 inhibition as shown by compounds 3 and 4, which showed similar activities. In previous studies, sargachromenol (6) was shown to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties that were assessed by electrochemical studies, by reaction with the stable free radical DPPH, and by inhibition of TPA-induced mouse ear edema (7, 27). In this paper, we present additional support of the biological activity of I. juruensis by demonstrating the ability of its isolates to inhibit LPO (76% at 100 ppm) (Figure 3) and COX-1 (98%) and COX-2 (84%) enzymes (Figure 4). In contrast, plastoquinone 7 exhibited poor inhibitory activities of LPO and COX-1 and -2 enzymes. This was probably due to Figure 1. Selected HMBC correlations for compound 8. Figure 2.

Food Chem., Vol. 55, No. 7, 2007 Silva et al. the lack of aromatic hydroxyls in its molecule and/or its oxidizing features associated with the quinone moiety. Poor inhibitory activities toward COX-1 and -2 enzymes were also observed for compounds 8 and 9. In contrast, arylalkanoic acid 9 inhibited LPO by 79%, whereas compound 8 showed much lower ability to protect liposomes from oxidation (Figure 3b). Guaiacin (10) presented the highest LPO inhibitory activity (>95% at 100 ppm) among the tested compounds from I. juruensis fruits. This was probably due to the presence of two veratryl moieties in its structure, which may increase the hydrogen radical donating ability of the aromatic hydroxyl groups. It also strongly inhibited COX-1 (75% at 100 ppm) enzyme but showed weak activity toward COX-2 (<20% at 100 ppm). The findings of our research on I. juruensis seeds and leaves have clearly shown that the plant parts studied possessed LPO inhibitory activity and were in agreement with the anecdotal reports. In addition, the moderate inhibition of COX-2 enzyme by extracts from seeds and leaves and the isolates from them further suggested the potential health beneficial effects of this plant and validated the ethno uses of I. juruensis decoction by Amazon Indians.

Ten replicate analyses of cotton plant samples with 10% to 15% TNC gave standard deviations of 0.28 and 0.14, respectively. The same degree of accuracy was obtained when analyzing different parts of cotton plants and lyo- philized cactus pads (Opuntia, s.P.) harvested at different seasons of the year. These materials ranged from 10% to 70% TNC. The authors’ technique can be conducted for about one-tenth the cost of other methods in use. A complete analysis can be performed in 24 h elapsed time, while other techniques require 3 to 4 days. It should also be noted that a minimum of glassware is required. This represents a saving of initial cost and routine glassware- washing time. It is especially noteworthy that the de- tergent action of the Teles’ reagent allows effective cleansing of the Folin tubes by simple rinsing four times with distilled water. In addition, it also allows the use of a flow-through curvette. The reduced number of opera- tions make the technique more accurate and less tedious. The reagents used, in addition to being less expensive, can be prepared with distilled water with no need for deionizers or other water retreatment. The substitution of dini- trosalicylic acid (Summer and Somer, 1949) for Teles’ reagent gave similar results. One technician easily ana- lyzed an average of 96 samples in 24-h elapsed time. In case the laboratory is equipped with only an ordinary centrifuge (maximum speed ca. 1500 rpm), the use of 4 mL of a 2% solution of neutral lead acetate (only the neutral salt) in water instead of 4 mL of distilled water before centrifugation also gives a clear supernatant. This amount of lead salt does not interfere with the analysis as was demonstrated in the course of the experiment with comparative analyses. The lead precipitation also would allow aliquot filtration, but the authors avoided this op- eration since it increases time and cost.

Estragole, the major constituent of the essential oil of Croton aff. zehntneri, family Euphorbiaceae, occurs together with minor quantities of camphor, anethole, isoborneol, caryophyllene, y-elemene, safrol, methylisoeugenol, n-heptadecane, and n-eicosane. These compounds are being reported for the first time in the genus Croton. Fifteen predominant volatile constituents of the oil were analyzed by GC-MS and identified. The oil has a typical pleasant odor reminiscent of anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) The genus Croton is largely disperse in the semiarid lands of Brazilian Northeast and includes many species that produce essential oils with pleasant odors. This report deals with the examination of the volatile constituents of Croton aff. tehntneri (canelinha) family Euphorbiaceae collected in the state of CearB. The in- fusion of the leaves is used by local people as a beverage in place of coffee and as a remedy for stomachache and insomnia.

Preparative GLC was carried out using a modified FID chromatograph (splitter 1OO:l) with a 9 mm x 6.5 m aluminum column packed with 20% OV-210 on Chro- mosorb W. GC-MS separation was carried out with a glass column (3 mm X 1.5 m) packed with 3% OV-1 on Chromosorb W coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV. Infrared spectra were obtained using liquid films. NMR spectra were run in CCl,, using a 60 MHz in- strument and TMS as internal standard. Double reso- nance experiments were realized with the same above conditions at room temperature. Extraction of the Oils. The plant was collected in Araripe-Cearb and transported to the laboratory in an air-conditioned vehicle. Finely ground material was steam distilled in a modified steam generator (Craveiro et al., 1976); the oils were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and sealed in all-glass vials under Nz. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The essential oils were obtained by steam distillation of the leaves, stems, and wood in yields of 0.7, 2.5, and 0.273, respectively. The chemical composition of the above oils is described in Table I. The separations were performed initially with a GLC analytical column, followed by analysis with a GC-MS system. Whenever possible, preparative GLC was used to allow NMR and IR confirmations. Previous work in the essential oils of the Euphorbiaceae family, genus Croton (Guenther, 1950; Bracho and Crowley, 1966; Craveiro et al., 1976) do not make any reference to the present species which is native to the Brazilian Northeast. The presence of estragole, camphor, anethole, isoborneol, caryophyllene, y-elemene, safrole, methylisoeugenol, n- heptadecane, and n-eicosane is related for the first time in the genus as far as we know. Estragole imparts to the oil the characteristic flavor similar to anise seed oil. Methyleugenol, a potent anhestesic (Carlini et al., 1976), should be responsible for the pharmacological activity of the plant infusions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Botanical identification by Prof. Afrdnio G.

The leaves afforded three glabretal-type triterpene derivatives esterified by N-methylanthranilic acid (3-5). Compounds 1 and 2 displayed weak inhibitory activity when assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Compounds 1-5 were inactive in a brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality test. Raulinoa is a monospecific genus, and the species Raulinoa echinata Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic to the Itajaı´ Valley, Santa Catarina, Brazil.1 This perennial woody shrub is characterized by the presence of spines and has been found only in a restricted location (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks of the Itajaı´ River at an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing a high degree of adaptation to the environment. In continuation of our research on the chemistry of Raulinoa echinata,2,3 inves- tigation of methanol extracts of stems and leaves has led to the isolation of the new 21R,25-dimethylmelianodiol (1) and 21â,25-dimethylmelianodiol (2) and also three new N-methylanthranilic acid esters of the glabretal-type com- pounds 3-5. In this work, the isolated compounds were also assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and in the brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality test. The hexane extract of the stems of R. echinata yielded the triterpenes melianone and melianodiol, which exhibited spectral data in agreement with the literature.4,5 The hemiacetal ring of these compounds opens and closes in solution; thus, a mixture of epimers is always present. From the methanol extract compounds of R. echinata stems 1 and 2 were obtained. As shown previously for melianone and melianodiol, these compounds exhibited resonances in their 1H NMR spectra at ca. δ 5.30 (brd, J ) 3.0), ascribable to H-7, and seven singlets for quaternary methyl groups between δ 0.82 and 1.25. Resonances at δ 216.7, 145.6/145.3, and 118.1/118.0 were assigned to C-3, C-8, and C-7, respectively, in the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 2. In contrast to melianone or melianodiol, two methoxyl group signals were observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2. The side chain in each case was found to be the 21,- 25-dimethoxy analogue of melianodiol, as verified by het- eronuclear correlations of the methoxyl groups with C-21 and C-25 in the HMBC spectra of 1 and 2. The HSQC spectra of compounds 1 and 2 showed correlations of the C-21 group resonances at δ 109.7 and 104.7 with H-21 [at δ 4.79 and δ 4.68 d (J ) 3.4 Hz) for 1 and 2, respectively], characterizing them as C-21 epimers. The H-23 [4.16 ddd (J ) 7.3, 5.4, 2.9 Hz)] and C-23 (δ 75.1) resonances, in addition to the H-24 (3.37 brd) and C-24 (δ 76.4) signals, showed correlations in the HSQC spectrum of compound 1. The isomer 2 showed the same correlations but inverted chemical shifts for C-23 (δ 77.8) and C-24 (δ 76.7). Additional information was obtained by HMBC and NOE difference NMR experiments. In the HMBC spectra, cor- relations for C-25 (δ 77.2) and H-26/27 (δ 1.15 and 1.25) for compound 1, and at δ 77.7 with 1.18 and 1.25 for compound 2, were observed. The H-18 (δ 0.82) signal in the HMBC spectrum of compound 1 correlated with C-12 (δ 31.1), C-13 (δ 43.6), C-14 (δ 51.0), and C-17 (δ 50.7). For compound 2, H-18 showed the same correlations, but the chemical shift of C-17 was upfield (δ 44.9). This difference was attributed to a γ-gauche effect of the oxygenated substituent on C-21â. Nakanishi et al.5 performed the X-ray crystallographic analysis of a melianone acetate analogue, comparing chemical shifts of R- and â-melianone acetates. According to their findings, C-21 exhibited downfield shifts and C-23 showed upfield shifts, in the C-21R epimer. These arguments were confirmed by NOE difference experiments for 1 and 2 (Table 3).

This enhancement was not observed for OMe-21 of compound 2. Accordingly, the structures of 1 and 2 were assigned as 21R,25-dimethylmelianodiol- [(21R,23R)epoxy-24-hydroxy-21R,25-methoxy]tirucalla-7- en-3-one and 21â,25-dimethylmelianodiol[(21S,23R)epoxy- 24-hydroxy-21â,25-dimethoxy]tirucalla-7-en-3-one, respect- ively. Compound 3 exhibited a pair of doublets (one hydrogen each), at δ 0.49 (J ) 5.0 Hz) and 0.74 (J ) 5.0 Hz), in the COSY NMR spectrum. In the HSQC NMR spectrum, these hydrogens correlated with a methylene carbon at δ 13.4, indicating a 14,18-cycloapoeuphane skeleton. The side chain of compound 3 was assigned as a methylmelianodiol- type unit, as evidenced by resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum at δ 4.84 [(d, J ) 3.0 Hz), H-21], 4.04 [(ddd, J ) 10.2, 4.8, 2.0 Hz), H-23], 3.51 [(d, J ) 5.0 Hz), H-24], and 3.36 s (OMe-21).6 The H-21 signal correlated in the HSQC spectrum with C-21 at δ 108.5, suggesting a C-21R-methoxy carbon, as in the case of 1. In the HMBC spectrum, H-21 correlated with C-23 (δ 77.6) and C-20 (δ 49.5), while H-23 and H-24 correlated in the HSQC spectrum with oxyme- thine carbons at δ 77.6 and 77.9, respectively. A broad singlet at δ 3.76 indicated a H-7â substituent,6 correlating in the HSQC spectrum with a carbon at δ 74.1. In the HMBC spectrum, the H-7â signal correlated with methine carbons at δ 43.8 (C-9) and 46.1 (C-5). The former showed correlations with singlets attributed to H-30 (δ 1.03) and H-19 (δ 0.93); the latter correlated with H-28 and H-29 (δ 1.00/0.92), respectively. The HREIMS of compounds 3-5 revealed an odd molecular weight, in each case indicating the presence of nitrogen in these molecules. A 3â-N- methylanthranilate group was indicated in the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 3-5 by the resonances at δ 4.70 (dd, J ) 11.1 and 5.0 Hz for 3 and 4; J ) 10.3 and 5.8 Hz for 5) corresponding to H-3R, which correlated in their HSQC spectra with an oxymethine carbon (δ 80.4 ( 0.1). Com- pound 3 exhibited aromatic signals at δ 7.90 (dd, J ) 8.0, 1.6 Hz), 7.31 (ddd, J ) 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz), 6.65 (brd, J ) 8.0 Hz), and 6.58 (ddd, J ) 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz). In addition, doublets at δ 7.70 (br, J ) 4.6 Hz, N-H) and 2.90 (J ) 4.6 Hz, N-Me) were observed in the COSY spectra, consistent with a N-methylanthranilic acid ester.

Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2002, Vol. 65, No. 4 563 The N-Me hydrogens correlated in the HMBC spectra of 3 with the quaternary carbon at δ 152.0 (C-3′), which showed correlations with the signals at δ 7.90 (H-7′) and 7.31 (H-5′). The carbonyl C-1′ (δ 168.2) correlated with H-7′ (δ 131.3). In the COSY spectrum coupling between H-7′/ H-6′ and H-5′/H-4′ was observed. Accordingly, compound 3 was assigned as (21R,23S)-epoxy-21R-methoxy-7R,24,25- trihydroxy-4R,4â,8â,10â-tetramethyl-25-dimethyl-14,18-cy- clo-5R,13R,14R,17R-cholestan-3â-N-methylanthranilic acid ester. Compound 4 differed from compound 3 only in the configuration of C-21, with chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra observed for the hydrogens of the side chain along with upfield changes for carbons C-21, C-17, and C-16, in agreement with a â-configuration, as discussed earlier for 2. Compound 4 was assigned the structure (21R,- 23S)-epoxy-21R-methoxy-7R,24,25-trihydroxy-4R,4â,8â,10â- tetramethyl-25-dimethyl-14,18-cyclo-5R,13R,14R,17R- cholestan-3â-N-methylanthranilic acid ester. Compound 5 was also assigned an N-methylanthranilic acid ester with a 14,18-cycloapoeuphane skeleton, but did not exhibit a methoxyl singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance was observed downfield (δ 5.28) when compared to the methoxylated derivatives 3 and 4. Ad- ditionally, the signals for the side chain of compound 5 were duplicated in the 1H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance showed a second doublet (of minor intensity) at δ 5.32, multiplets at δ 4.40 and 4.23 attributed to H-23, and doublets at δ 3.58 and 3.13 assigned to H-24. These observations strongly suggested that 5 is a C-21 hydroxyl derivative, isolated as an epimeric mixture.6,7 As for compounds 1-4, compound 5 was finally elucidated by a series of 2D NMR experiments, including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. NMR spectral data for compounds 1-5 are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the main H-C correlations in the long-range HMBC spectrum of 5. Thus, the structure of 5 was assigned as (21,23S)-epoxy-7R,21,- 24,25-tetrahydroxy-4R,4â,8â,10â-tetramethyl-25-dimethyl- 14,18-cyclo-5R,13R,14R,17R-cholestan-3â-N-methylanthra- nilic acid ester. Methoxylated protolimonoids were described previously from Turraea holstii (Meliaceae).8 It is possible that the methoxylated compounds 1-4 are artifacts of the extrac- tion process. Protolimonoids of the melianone-type and compounds with the 14,18-cycloapoeuphane-type skeleton have been found mainly in species of the Meliaceae, but were also found in some Rutaceae species. The former group was encountered from Phellodendron chinense9 and the latter from Skimmia japonica.10 Benzoyl,6 cinamoyl,6 tigloyl,7,11 acetyl,11,12 and isobutyryl13 ester acids of glabre- tal triterpenes at C-3 have been reported in the literature, with all exhibiting the R-configuration. However, 3â-N- methylanthranilic acid esters of glabretal-type triterpenes seem to be unprecedented in the literature. Compounds 1-5 were assayed in vitro against the trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed weak activity against the trypomastigote form (Y strain) of T. cruzi with IC50 values of 134.9 and 114.5 µg/mL, respectively, when compared with the refer- ence compound crystal violet (IC50 7.5 µg/mL). Compounds 3-5 were inactive in this assay, with IC50 values of > 1000 µg/mL. Compounds 1-5 were all inactive in the brine shrimp lethality test (LD50 > 100 µg/mL). Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were determined on a Microquı´mica MQAPF-301 instrument and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. UV spectra were determined with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. IR spectra were taken on a Bomem Hartman & Braun MB- Series instrument. A Bruker DRX-400 NMR spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C, was used. All spectra were run in CDCl3 with TMS as internal standard. For HREIMS an Autospec-Micromass-EBE was used (Universidade Estadual de Campinas). Plant Material. Stems and leaves of R. echinata were collected in Ressacada, Ibirama, SC, Brazil, and identified by A. Reis (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo). A voucher specimen [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] has been deposited at the Herba´rio Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaı´, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered stems (5 kg) and leaves (3 kg) were extracted with hexane and MeOH. Then, half (100 g) of the MeOH extract was fraction- ated over silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) into three fractions: CH2- Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The latter fraction (89 g) was dissolved in H2O-MeOH and successively partitioned with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane, CH2Cl2, and EtOAc). A portion of the ethyl acetate fraction (2 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent hexane-acetone (75:25 and then a gradient of the same solvent of increasing polari- ties), furnishing fractions A to I. Fraction A (460 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) affording several triterpenes. Among them, a mixture of compounds 1 and 2 (7 mg) was purified over a Lobar Lichroprep [(Merck) Si 60 (40-63 µm) B (310-25)] column, using hexane-acetone (95:5) as eluent, affording 1 (3.6 mg) and 2 (3.2 mg). From the hexane extract of stems, significant amounts of melianone (350 mg) and melianodiol (150 mg) were obtained using column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh) and using as eluent hexane-acetone in gradient.3 Table 3.

The hexane (15 g) and CH2Cl2 fractions (10 g) obtained were chromatographed over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using solvents of increasing polarity: hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. A fraction eluted by CH2Cl2 (1.7 g) from the hexane fraction yielded compounds 4 (39 mg) and 5 (44 mg) using column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh) and hexane-acetone (9:1) for elution. The EtOAc (1.5 g) fraction from the CH2Cl2 fraction yielded compound 3 (50 mg) with the same solvent mixture above. 21r,25-Dimethylmelianodiol[(21R,23R)epoxy-24-hy- droxy-21r,25-methoxy]tirucalla-7-en-3-one (1): colorless gum; [R]25D -65.2° (c 0.02, CHCl3); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 204 (2.95), 248 (2.42) nm; IR (film) νmax 2920, 1707, 1458, 1375, 1083 cm-1; 1H NMR data, see Table 1; 13C NMR data, see Table 2; EIMS m/z 389 (26), 359 (8), 307 (41), 239 (10), 199 (11), 161 (100), 135 (23), 131 (11) 119 (10); HREIMS m/z 516.38151 (calcd for C32H52O5, 516.38147). 21â,25-Dimethylmelianodiol[(21S,23R)epoxy-24-hy- droxy-21â,25-dimethoxy]tirucalla-7-en-3-one (2): colorless gum; [R]25D -103.0° (c 0.02, CHCl3); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 209 (3.37), 244 (2.89) nm; IR (film) νmax 2920, 1707, 1458, 1375, 1083 cm-1; 1H NMR data, see Table 1; 13C NMR data, see Table 2; EIMS m/z 389 (30), 359 (10), 307 (30), 239 (10), 199 (15), 161 (100), 135 (20), 131 (8), 119 (5); HREIMS m/z 516.38148 (calcd for C32H52O5, 516.38147).

Their chemical structures were assigned on the basis of MS and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Xanthones 1-6 showed moderate free radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as well as antioxidant activity evidenced by redox properties measured on ElCD-HPLC. As part of our bioprospecting program Biota-FAPESP (The Virtual Institute of Biodiversity), whose main goal is to discover potential antitumoral, antifungal, and antioxi- dant agents from plants of the Cerrado and Atlantic forest, we have screened hundreds of plants collected in the State of Sa˜o Paulo. Among these, Arrabidaea samydoides was chosen for detailed chemical investigation due to prior antioxidant activity revealed on a TLC autographic assay sprayed with â-carotene solution, and to our knowledge there are no previous reports on chemical and biological studies. This species belongs to the family Bignoniaceae, which contains about 120 genera and 800 species distrib- uted throughout tropical regions of South America and Africa.1 Species from the genus Arrabidaea have been used in traditional medicine for wound asepsis and treating intestinal disorders.2 In northeast Brazil, Arrabidaea chica is used in tattoos by Indians due to the pigments carajurin and carajurone.2,3 A literature review indicated that this genus is a source of anthocyanins, flavonoids, and tannins.3-7 The ethanolic extract from the stems showed promising antioxidant activity and led to the isolation of three new C-glucopyranosylxanthones, 2-(2′-O-trans-caffeoyl)-C-â-D- glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone (1), 2-(2′- O-trans-cinnamoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahy- droxyxanthone (2), and 2-(2′-O-trans-coumaroyl)-C-â-D- glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone (3), and the known mangiferin (4),8 2-(2′-O-benzoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyra- nosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone (5),9 and muraxan- thone (6).10 In this paper, we report the isolation, structure elucidation, and antioxidant properties of these C-glucopy- ranosylxanthones. Compounds 4 and 6 were identified by comparison with previously published NMR and other physical data.8,10 Compound 5 was described previously as a mixture of three isomers from Hymenophyllum recurvum.9 Only a few 13C NMR data were analyzed and discussed. In this paper we describe the complete 1H, 13C NMR and ES-MS/MS data for this compound. Compound 1 was shown to have the molecular formula C28H23O14 [M - H]- m/z 583.1008, by analysis of the negative-ion HRESIMS. The IR spectrum showed bands at 3370, 1615, and 1474 cm-1 accounting for hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic groups, respectively. The 13C NMR spectrum showed six signals for hydroxy- methine carbons, suggesting the presence of a sugar moiety, and 22 signals for sp2 carbons, which could be assigned to three aromatic rings, and also two carbonyls and one additional olefinic function. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1, a caffeoyl moiety was identified by signals at δ 6.79 (1H, d, J ) 2.0 Hz, H-2′′), 6.58 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5′′), and 6.67 (1H, br d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-6′′), * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Nat. Prod. 2003, 66, 1384-1387 10.1021/np030100t CCC: $25.00 © 2003 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 09/24/2003 along with the olefinic protons in a trans arrangement at δ 7.23 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-7′′) and 5.93 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-8′′). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum also dis- played singlets at δ 7.22, 6.61, and 6.15, which showed correlation with signals at δ 109.1, 103.4, and 95.0, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. These data, analyzed with their corresponding 13C NMR data (Table 2), and further information from ESI-MS/MS (m/z 405), and ana- logues published in the literature,10 suggested a xanthone skeleton linked to a caffeoyl-glucose moiety for compound 1. TOCSY experiments showed a complete sequence of five correlated signals of the sugar moiety at δ 3.4-3.9. In addition a doublet at δ 5.01 (J ) 10.0 Hz) and one multiplet at δ 5.58 were assigned to H-1′ and H-2′, respectively, on the basis of COSY, 13C NMR, and HMQC spectral analysis. The unusual downfield chemical shift of the H-2′ signal suggested an acyl moiety at C-2′,12 which was corroborated by the values from C-1′, C-2′, and C-3′ (Table 2) and observation of a cross-peak between the H-2′ and C-9′′ (δ 168.3) signals in the HMBC spectrum. Additional correla- tions between H-1′ (δ 5.01) and C-1 (δ 162.8), C-2 (δ 106.0), and C-3 (δ 165.0) evidenced the linkage of the glucose moiety at C-2. This spectrum also showed correlations of the signals at δ 6.15 (H-4) to C-2 (δ 106.0), C-3 (δ 165.0), C-4a (δ 158.8), and C-9a (δ 102.9); δ 6.61 (H-5) to C-10a (δ 153.0), C-6 (δ 155.3), C-7 (δ 144.8), and C-8a (δ 113.6), and δ 7.22 (H-8) to C-10a (δ 153.0), C-6 (δ 155.3), C-7 (δ 144.8), C-9a (δ 102.9), and C-9 (δ 181.1), supporting the substitu- tion pattern proposed for the aglycone. The UV spectra recorded in MeOH and shift reagents (AlCl3, HCl, KOH, NaOAc, and H3BO3) confirmed the presence of free hydroxy groups at C-1 and C-3 and an ortho-dihydroxylation pattern for the B ring of compound 1.11 Finally, the positive-ion electrospray tandem mass spectra ESI(+)-MS/MS (Table 3) completely established the proposed structure for 1. The fragment at m/z 585 (a) is rather simple and structurally characteristic, as it shows two major fragment ions of m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), which can be clearly related to the proposed C-glucosylxanthone, as well as the fragment at m/z 163 (d), confirming the caffeoyl moiety for this xan- thone. Compound 2 was assigned the empirical formula C28H23O12, [M - H]- m/z 551.1241, by accurate negative- ion HRESIMS. The UV and IR spectra were nearly identi- cal to those obtained for 1. Direct comparison of 1H data (Table 1) of 1 and 2 showed that the signals for the caffeoyl moiety from 1 were replaced in 2 by a pair of multiplets at δ 7.56 and 7.34. The hydrogens corresponding to the two olefinic protons were similar and appeared as doublets with a coupling constant of 15.5 Hz at δ 7.39 (H-7′′) and 6.37 (H-8′′), revealing a cinnamoyl moiety with a trans stereo- chemistry.

The ESI(+)-MS/ MS tandem mass spectrum of the protonated ion at m/z 553 (a) was analyzed and also corroborated the proposed structure for this compound (Table 3). It showed two major ion fragments at m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), which revealed the C-glucosylxanthone backbone, whereas the unique acylium ion fragment at m/z 131 (d) corroborated the cinnamoyl group. Compound 3 was assigned the molecular formula C28H23O12, [M - H]- m/z 567.1183, by accurate negative- ion HRESIMS. The UV and IR spectra were very similar to those of 1 and 2. A comparison of the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 3 with those of 1 revealed that the only noticeable difference was related to the aromatic moiety substituent at C-2′. The caffeoyl moiety in 1 was replaced by a coumaroyl residue in compound 3. The coumaroyl moiety was evidenced in the 1H NMR spectrum by two doublets at δ 7.18 (2H, J ) 8.0 Hz) and 6.61 (2H, J ) 8.0 Hz), characteristic of an AA′XX′ system, and by two olefinic protons in a trans arrangement at δ 7.29 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-7′′) and 5.99 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-8′′). These data were also supported by 13C NMR (Table 2) and mass spectral data. The ESI(+)-MS/MS tandem mass spectrum of the protonated ion at m/z 569 (a) registered for 3 is also diagnostic for a xanthone with these characteristic features (Table 3). The distinct peaks showed the common and major C-glucosylxanthone fragment ions at m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), whereas the unique acylium ion fragment at m/z 147 (d) confirmed the coumaroyl moiety. The scavenging effects obtained for compounds 1-6 are shown in Table 5. Compounds 1 and 3 showed the best scavenging activities, taking as the reference the flavonoid rutin (IC50 12.34 µg/mL), revealing a moderate antioxidant activity, while compounds 6, 2, and 5 showed lower activities and similar IC50 values. This result indicates that the moderate free radical scavenging activity of the xan- thones is due to their hydrogen-donating ability, so in- creasing the number of hydroxyls or catechol groups results in a more efficient radical scavenging effect.13 The electro- chemical behavior displayed by these compounds showed a good correlation with the radical scavenging effect measured in the DPPH assay. This observation clearly indicates that substances with oxidative peaks below +1.2 V (Table 5) and a large oxidative capacity have more promising radical scavenging properties than those that are oxidized at higher potentials.14 Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were determined at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin- Elmer 1710 spectrometer and a Perkin-Elmer UV-vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on a Micro- quimica MQAPF-301. 1H and 13C NMR spectra and gHMBC and gHMQC, gCOSY, and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive- and negative-ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-resolution orthogonal time-of-flight (o-TOF) configuration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 µL/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH-H2O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/MS spectra of mass-selected ions were acquired using 10-20 eV collisions with argon. For column chromatog- raphy purification, RP-18 (230-400 mesh, Merck) and Sepha- dex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used as solid supports. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisaldehyde 5% in H2SO4 followed by heating. Scavenging activities were mea- sured using a Varian Star 9090 ElCD composed of a glassy carbon working electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A Rheodyne injector, with a 20 µL loop and a Varian 210 HPLC pump as solvent delivery module, was used. Separation of the micromolecules was carried out on a Phenomenex ODS LUNA, 5 µm (250 × 4.60 mm) column. The isocratic phase used was MeOH-H2O (85:15) (HPLC grade, Mallinckrodt, and ultrapure water, obtained by passing redistilled water through a Milli-Q system, Millipore). All separations were carried out at 30 °C. Plant Material. The stems of Arrabidaea samydoides were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guac¸u´, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M.Y. in April 2000. A voucher specimen (Moraes 43) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. Dried and pulverized stems (0.837 kg) from A. samydoides were exhaustively extracted with ethanol at room temperature to give a crude extract (32.86 g). The resultant extract was diluted with MeOH-H2O (8:2) and then partitioned with hexane, CHCl3, and EtOAc to afford dried hexane (0.46 g), CHCl3 (2.50 g), EtOAc (4.77 g), stable emulsion (3.77 g), and hydroalcoholic (6.46 g) extracts. Compound 4 (3.03 g) was derived from the emulsion extract (3.77 g) and purified by successive crystallization using MeOH. The EtOAc extract was diluted in n-BuOH and partitioned with H2O. After the removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 3.40 and 0.37 g, respectively. The n-BuOH extract was further purified using Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting isocratically with MeOH, to afford 189 fractions. Fractions 160-167 (138.2 mg) yielded compound 1. Fractions 109-114 (186.7 mg) were combined, and further purification using a silica gel RP-18 column, eluted with gradient mixtures of H2O-MeOH (95:5 to 100), led to the isolation of 5 (14.8 mg) and 2 (21.0 mg). Fractions 115-122 (288.8 mg) were combined and subjected to silica gel RP-18 column chromatography using gradient mixtures of H2O-MeOH (95:5 to 100) to yield 6 (27.4 mg). Fractions 123-136 (294.0 mg) were combined and subjected to a silica gel RP-18 column eluted with gradient mixtures of H2O-MeOH (95:5 to 100) to afford 3 (25.3 mg). Determination of the Radical Scavenging Activity. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a stable radical in methanol (200 µmol, 2 mL). The reagent was added to a 1 mL aliquot of the compounds, previously dissolved in Table 4.

Each mixture was shaken and held for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin was used as a reference compound. DPPH solution (2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as a control. The evaluation of the reduced form of DPPH generated in situ was performed measuring the decrease in the current (I) on the electrochemical cell of the ElCD.15 The areas obtained in each chromatogram were normalized and compared with the one obtained for the blank. The radical scavenging activity of the samples was expressed in terms of IC50 (concentration in µmol required for a 50% decrease in current (I) by the reduced form of DPPH). Rutin was used as reference compound. Redox Potential. The determination of the optimal poten- tial (Eox) required to apply on each sample was obtained by means of a hydrodynamic voltammogram generated for each compound (Table 5). 2-(2′-O-trans-Caffeoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7- tetrahydroxyxanthone (1): orange powder (MeOH); [R]25D -185.46° (c 5.0, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 242 (4.48), 257 (4.46), 318 (4.35), 387 (sh) (4.10) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3) 235.5 (4.58), 265.5 (4.57), 355 (4.45), 408.5 (sh) (4.34) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3 + HCl) 233 (4.54), 265 (4.47), 337 (4.52), 406.5 (4.05) nm; (MeOH + KOH) 248 (4.62), 272 (4.49), 392 (4.65); (MeOH + NaOAc) 241 (4.54), 332 (4.32), 376 (4.28) nm; (MeOH + H3- BO3 + NaOAc) 261.5 (4.57), 357 (4.42); IR (KBr) νmax 3370, 1615, 1474, 1287, 1176, 1072, 813, 704 cm-1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR (CD3OD), see Tables 1 and 2; ESI-MS/MS, see Tables 3 and 4; HRESI-MS m/z 583.1008 [M - H]- (calcd for C28H23O14, 583.1088). 2-(2′-O-trans-Cinnamoyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7- tetrahydroxyxanthone (2): yellow powder (MeOH); [R]25D -125.66° (c 2.65, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 243 (sh) (4.63), 258 (4.78), 315 (sh) (4.20), 364.5 (4.18) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3) 237 (4.66), 264 (4.81), 325.5 (4.23), 378.5 (4.34) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3 + HCl) 241 (4.64), 260 (4.76), 340 (sh) (4.27), 375 (sh) (4.20) nm; (MeOH + KOH) 240 (4.60), 273 (4.74), 340 (sh) (4.20), 391 (4.61) nm, (MeOH + NaOAc) 242 (4.70), 260 (4.72), 374 (4.38) nm; (MeOH + H3BO3 + NaOAc) 262 (4.85), 314 (4.31), 371 (4.36) nm; IR (KBr) νmax 3378, 2925, 1628, 1473, 1286, 1186, 1074, 827, 765 cm-1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR (CD3- OD), see Tables 1 and 2; ESI-MS/MS, see Tables 3 and 4; HRESI-MS m/z 551.1241 [M - H]- (calcd for C28H23O12, 551.1190). 2-(2′-O-trans-Coumaroyl)-C-â-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7- tetrahydroxyxanthone (3): yellow powder (MeOH); [R]25D -189.0° (c 2.7, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ϵ) 237.5 (4.41), 258.5 (4.43), 314.5 (4.42), 367 (4.02) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3) 235 (4.57), 268.5 (4.52), 321.5 (4.42), 416 (4.26) nm; (MeOH + AlCl3 + HCl) 232.5 (4.53), 265.5 (4.46), 322.5 (4.49), 405.5 (4.00) nm; (MeOH + KOH) 251 (4.45), 272 (sh) (4.31), 283 (4.38) nm; (MeOH + NaOAc) 236.5 (4.48), 260 (4.35), 315.5 (4.35), 374.5 (4.21) nm; (MeOH + H3BO3 + NaOAc) 230 (4.46), 262 (4.52), 317 (4.41), 373 (4.09) nm; IR (KBr) νmax 3390, 2924, 1614, 1473, 1286, 1168, 1000, 819 cm-1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR (CD3OD), see Tables 1 and 2; ESI-MS/MS, see Tables 3 and 4; HRESI- MS m/z 567.1183 [M - H]- (calcd for C28H24O13, 567.1139).

The green fruits of this plant were also investigated, resulting in the isolation of 1 and 4. Their structures were elucidated using a combination of multidimensional NMR and MS techniques, and relative stereochem- istries were established by NOESY correlations and analysis of coupling constants. The DNA-damaging activity of these compounds was evaluated using a mutant yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, assay. Cassia is a major genus of the Leguminosae, comprising about 600 species, some widely distributed throughout the world. In Brazil, Cassia plants are recognized as ornamen- tal due to the beauty of their yellow blossoms.1 Several species of Cassia have been reported to accumulate phe- nolic compounds with diverse biological and pharmacologi- cal properties,2 and these are widely used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial, laxative, antiulcerogenic, analgesic, and antiinflammatory properties.2,3 A few 2,6- disubstituted-3-piperidinols with alkyl long chains have been isolated from C. spectabilis,4,5 C. excelsa,6,7 C. car- naval,8 and C. leptophylla.9 In our previous investigation on the chemical composition of the CHCl3/MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of C. leptophylla, we reported the occurrence of eight new piperidine alkaloids, four that were DNA-damaging active and four that were inactive.9 This species was mistakenly identified at that time and now has been identified as Cassia spectabilis (DC.) Irwin et Barn (Leguminosae). As part of our ongoing search for new bioactive metabolites from plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest of the State of Sa˜o Paulo, we have isolated three new piperidine alkaloids, (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (1), (-)-7-hydroxyspectaline (2), and iso-6-spectaline (3), from the methanolic extract of the flowers and 1 from the green fruits of C. spectabilis, along of the known bioactive alkaloid (-)-spectaline (4). Herein, we present the isolation, struc- ture elucidation, and inhibitory activity of these alkaloids on mutant yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (-)-3-O-Acetylspectaline (1) was isolated as a pale yellow powder. HRESIMS and elemental analysis of 1 indicated a molecular formula C22H41NO3, with three unsaturation degrees. Its IR spectrum showed the presence of secondary amine (3341, 1550 cm-1), ester carbonyl (1730 cm-1), and ketone (1715 cm-1) functional groups. The 1H NMR spec- trum of 1 showed one hydroxymethine at δ 4.75 (br s, H-3), two methines at δ 2.53 (m, H-6) and 2.82 (dq, J ) 2.0, 6.5 Hz, H-2), three methyl peaks at δ 1.00 (d, J ) 6.50 Hz, H-7), 2.06 (s, H-14′), 2.00 (s, acetyl), and several methylene protons at δ 1.20-1.22 (br s, H-4′-H-9′). The 13C NMR spectrum showed the presence of three methine carbons at δ 70.4, 56.5, and 53.8, which, when analyzed together with the signals at δ 209.3, 29.1-29.2, and 18.5, strongly suggested a 2,6-disubstituted-3-piperidinol ring, similar to those reported for (-)-spectaline (4),9 previously isolated from C. spectabilis. The downfield value observed for hydroxymethine C-3 (δ 70.4) when compared with this carbon in (-)-spectaline (δ 67.9), together with the signals at δ 170.9 and 21.3, clearly indicated that an acetyl group was located at this carbon and allowed us to conclude that 1 is a natural acetyl derivative of (-)-spectaline. From the TOCSY 1H-1H correlations, it was possible to confirm the sequences of H-7/H-2/H-3/H-4/H-5/H-6/H-1′ protons. These assignments were confirmed by HMBC data that allowed unambiguous identification of the atoms in the piperidine ring and joining of the alkyl long chain to C-6 (Figure 1, Supporting Information). The relative configurations at C-2, C-3, and C-6 were established by comparison of the coupling constants observed for 1 with those published for 4 and NOESY correlations (Figure 2, Supporting Informa- tion). Compound 1 was hydrolyzed under neutral conditions with (MeO)2Mg,10,11 and the reaction product was identified as (-)-spectaline (4).9 The absolute stereochemistry of 4 has been determined by total synthesis,12 and the absolute configurations at C-2, C-3, and C-6 for alkaloid 1 were assigned as R, R, and S, respectively. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Prod. 2004, 67, 908-910 10.1021/np0303963 CCC: $27.50 © 2004 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 04/27/2004 Compound 2 was obtained as colorless oil, with a molecular formula of C20H39NO3 indicated by the molecular ion peak at m/z 342.3072 in its HRESIMS. The IR absorp- tion bands for a secondary amine (3340, 1550 cm-1), ketone function (1725 cm-1), and a strong peak for a hydroxyl group (3450 cm-1) were similar to those of 4.9 Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data of 2 with those of 4 suggested that compound 2 was very similar to 4 except for the data related to the piperidine ring. The 13C data of 2 showed the same resonances observed for 4 with the exception of the values for C-2 (61.1), C-3 (66.2), C-6 (56.9), and C-7 (64.7), indicating that the C-7 methyl group in 2 is a hydroxymethylene group. The significant shielding ob- served for C-3 (66.2) when compared to 4 could be explained by the γ-effect of the C-7 hydroxymethylene (Figure 2, Supporting Information). With this molecular feature, the OH group at C-3 prefers the axial orientation, permitting an intramolecular H-bond between the hydroxyl at C-7 and the lone pair of electrons on N.4,13 These findings were further supported by 1H NMR spectra, which showed signals at δ 3.66 (1H, dd, J ) 6.5, 11.0 Hz) and 3.74 (1H, dd, J ) 4.5, 11.0 Hz) attributable to hydrogens at C-7. The structure of 2 was also strongly supported by HMBC (Figure 1, Supporting Information), 1H-1H COSY, and TOCSY correlations. The stereocenters C-2, C-3, and C-6 in 2 were also assigned as R, R, and S, respectively, by a combination of NMR spectroscopy, molecular modeling, and a comparative analysis based on the known configuration of 4. Alkaloid 3 was assigned the molecular formula C20H40- NO2 on the basis of the HRESIMS. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data, however, were quite different from those observed for 4, mainly the data related to the piperidine ring. Detailed analysis of 1H and 13C chemical shift values closely matched those of iso-6-carnavaline5 and leptophyl- line B,9 except for the values attributed to the long chain, which was similar to those found for 4. By NOESY spectra, no correlation was observed between H-2 and H-6, as expected due to the changing of configuration at C-6 (Figure 2, Supporting Information). Additionally, interpre- tation of COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra confirmed that 4 was iso-6-spectaline. Biological activity data for alkaloids 1-4 were obtained using mechanism-based yeast mutant bioassays14 and are summarized in Table 1. These data show that besides (-)-spectaline (4),9 already reported to exhibit some effect on DNA, only alkaloid 1 showed activity, which was comparable to that observed for 4. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 °C. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X FT spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125.67 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using ESI mode and MeOH/H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 30 V). Al2O3 grade I, type WN-3 was used for column chromatography, TLC, and preparative TLC; visualization of TLC plates was made by spraying with iodochloroplatinate reagent (Merck) and Dragen- dorff’s reagent. Plant Material. The flowers and fruits of C. spectabilis were collected in May and December 1999 from a specimen cultivated at the Botanical Garden of the state of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen (SILVA-193) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden. Bioassays. Identical to those reported earlier.14 Extraction and Isolation. The ethanolic extract of the flowers was concentrated, redissolved in MeOH/H2O (8:2), and partitioned successively with hexanes, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. The CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was concentrated, yield- ing 39 g of crude material. This was redissolved in 100 mL of CH2Cl2 and extracted with aqueous 40% HCl (3 × 50 mL); the combined aqueous fractions were adjusted to pH 9 using concentrated NH4OH. The resulting aqueous basic solution was exhaustively extracted with CH2Cl2, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated, furnishing 9 g of a crude alkaloidal fraction. The crude alkaloidal portion was further chromato- graphed on a neutral Al2O3 column with a gradient mixture of EtOH/CHCl3/hexanes as eluent, affording piperidine alka- loids (-)-spectaline (4) (4.82 g) and 1 (151 mg) and a complex alkaloid mixture. Further purification of this mixture on preparative TLC, using CH2Cl2/n-hexane/EtOH (6.5:3.0:0.5) as eluent, afforded (-)-7-hydroxyspectaline (2) (5.5 mg) and iso- 6-spectaline (3) (20 mg). The fruit extract was partitioned successively with hexanes, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. The CH2Cl2 fraction obtained from the partition procedures was extracted with aqueous 40% HCl (3 × 50 mL) and then adjusted to pH 9 with NH4OH. The aqueous basic solution was exhaustively extracted with CH2- Cl2 as indicated above for the isolation of alkaloids from flowers. Purification of this alkaloidal mixture by preparative TLC afforded 4 (3.0 mg) and 1 (4.2 mg) as the major constituents.

To a solution of 1 (32 mg, 0.082 mmol) in dry MeOH (1.7 mL) was added 4 g of activated magnesium metal. After an exothermic initiation of the reaction, it was kept under N2 atmosphere and agitated at room temperature for 8 h. CCD analysis then indicated a less polar product had been formed. More Mg metal (2 g) was added, and the reaction was continued for another 48 h. After total conversion, the reaction was completed by the addition of 0.5 mL of aqueous 2 N HCl followed by extraction with CH2- Cl2. The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated, affording 28.3 mg of a solid product, mp 52.6-54.9 °C, [R]D20 -9° (c 0.11, CH2Cl2), identified as (-)-spectaline (4).9 Acknowledgment.

Additionally, 19 known compounds such as benzoic acids, chromenes, and flavonoids were isolated and identified. The antifungal activity of these compounds was evaluated by bioautographic TLC assay against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. Piperaceae species have been extensively investigated as a source of new natural products with potential anti- tumoral, antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal activi- ties.1-3 The phytochemical profile in Piper species is characterized by the production of typical classes of com- pounds such as amides, benzoic acids, and chromenes in addition to lignans, neolignans, and a few alkaloids.4-6 As part of our research aiming to uncover new antifungal compounds in Brazilian Piperaceae species, we have previ- ously reported the occurrence of pyrrolidine amides in P. hispidum7 and piperidine, isobutyl, and pyrrolidine amides in P. tuberculatum8 and P. arboreum.9 Additionally, anti- fungal prenylated hydroquinones and flavanones from leaves of P. crassinervium10 have been described as well. The search for new antifungal compounds will contribute to establish a model for further investments in this field in order to preserve, to study, and to exploit rationally the remaining flora of Sa˜o Paulo State. In the course of the Biota Program (http://www.biota.sp), a large number of Piper species collected in the state of Sa˜o Paulo had their extracts assayed by means of bioau- tography using Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig). Since the extracts of Piper crassinervium Kunth, P. aduncum L., P. hostman- nianum (Miquel) C. DC., and P. gaudichaudianum Kunth showed high growth inhibitory activity, they were subjected to dereplication procedures using chromatographic tech- niques associated with the bioautographic assay. Thus, the major aim of this paper is to describe the isolation and structural determination of the new antifungal compounds from Piperaceae species. Results and Discussion The MeOH extract from leaves of P. crassinervium yielded three prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acids [4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzo- ic acid (crassinervic acid, 1), 4-hydroxy-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′- oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (2), and 4-hydroxy- (3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-Z-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (3)], 3,4,5-trimethoxydihydrocinnamic acid12 (4), 1,4-dihydroxy- 2-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzene10 (5), and two flavanones [5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavanone13 (nar- ingenin 4′-methyl ether, 6) and 5,4′-dihydroxy-7-methoxy- flavanone14 (sakuranetin, 7)]. The CH2Cl2- and hexane-soluble parts of the MeOH extract of the leaves of P. aduncum yielded one new prenylated benzoic acid [methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3′-methyl- 1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate (aduncumene, 8)], four known chromenes [methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3′-methyl-2′-butenyl)- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (9), methyl 2,2-dimeth- yl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), methyl 8-hydroxy- 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (11), and 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid15,16 (12)], 4-methoxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), and two dihydrochalcones [2′,6′-dihydroxy-4′-meth- oxydihydrochalcone15 (14) and piperaduncine B17 (15)]. The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of P. hostmannianum yielded methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-ben- zopyran-6-carboxylate16 (10), three prenylated methyl hy- droxybenzoate derivatives [methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-butenyl)benzoate18,19 (16), methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-hydroxy-3′-butenyl)benzoate16 (17), and the new derivative methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate (hostmaniene, 18)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves and roots of P. gaudichaudianum yielded two chromenes [2-methyl- 2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2H-1- benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (gaudichaudianic acid, 20) and methyl 2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylate22 (21)], three prenylated benzoic acids [4-methoxy-3- (3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), 4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid23 (22), and methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)ben- zoate24 (methyl taboganate, 23)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). Compound 1 was isolated from the leaves of P. crassin- ervium as a white amorphous solid. Its molecular formula was established as C17H22O5 by analysis of its HREIMS spectrum (m/z 306.1459, calcd 306.1467). The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3380 cm-1), two carbonyl groups (1696, 1611 cm-1), and an aromatic ring (1489, 1421 cm-1).

Nat. Prod. 2004, 67, 1783-1788 10.1021/np030530j CCC: $27.50 © 2004 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 10/26/2004 for three aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.93 (d, J ) 8.9 Hz), 8.11 (dd, J ) 8.9 and 2.4 Hz), and 8.56 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz), indicative of a 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. Additional signals included three methyl singlets (δ 1.37, 1.50, 1.58), two doublets at δ 2.77 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz) and 2.64 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz), characteristic of an isolated R-carbonyl methylene group, and a triplet at δ 4.98 (1H, J ) 7.2 Hz), indicating the presence of a double bond in the side chain. The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) showed signals for 17 carbon atoms assigned as two carbonyl (δ 191.5, 170.6), six aromatic (δ 163.7, 137.3, 129.9, 122.1, 119.9, 118.8), two olefinic (δ 132.5, 122.9), three methyl (δ 25.6, 23.9, 17.5), one tertiary carbinolic (δ 82.3), and three aliphatic meth- ylenic carbons (δ 47.2, 39.3, 22.2). The assignments of the signals for aromatic carbons were based on comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data reported for known benzoic acids analogues.11 The connectivity between aromatic and aliphatic moieties was revealed by analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The correlations between signals at δ 8.56 (H-2)/2.77 (H-2′a)/2.64 (H-2′b) with 191.5 (C-1′) as well as between δ 8.56 (H-2)/8.11 (H-6) with 170.6 (CO2H) (Figure 1) indicated that compound 1 contains one carbonyl group at C-1′ and one carboxyl group attached to C-1. The double bond at the side chain was assigned on the basis of the observed cross-peaks between δ 4.98 (H-6′) and 25.6 (C-8′)/17.5 (C-9′) in the HMBC spectrum and between signals at δ 4.98 (H-6′), 2.03 (H-5′), 1.58 (H-8′), and 1.50 (H-9′) in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Thus, the hydroxyl group on a tertiary carbon atom was placed at C-3′ of the side chain, in agreement with the HMBC correlations observed between the hydrogen signals at δ 2.77 (H-2′a)/ 2.64 (H-2′b), 1.70 (H-4′), and 1.37 (H-10′) with the carbon signal at δ 82.3 (C-3′). Analysis of the DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMBC NMR spectra allowed full assignment for all hydrogen and carbon atoms, and thus, the structure of crassinervic acid (1) was elucidated as 4-hydroxy-3-(3′,7′- dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzoic acid. Compound 8 was isolated from the leaves of P. aduncum as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula C14H16O4 was determined by LRESIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 1700, 1610, and at 1445 cm-1, assignable to two carbonyl groups and aromatic double bonds, respectively. The structure of the prenylated benzoic acid derivative was recognized by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum, which showed signals at δ 8.18 (1H, d, J ) 1.9 Hz), 8.06 (1H, dd, J ) 8.5 and 1.9 Hz), and 6.93 (1H, d, J ) 8.5 Hz). This spectrum also showed a set of signals including two methyl groups at δ 1.96 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz)/2.20 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz) and a multiplet at 6.53 (1H), which are characteristics of an isoprene unit, and additionally, two methoxyl groups at δ 3.90 (3H, s) and 3.86 (3H, s). The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) exhibited, in the low-field region, one carbomethoxyl group at δ 166.6, six aromatic carbons at δ 161.2, 134.1, 132.0, 131.2, 122.9, 111.4, and two signals corresponding to the double-bond carbons at δ 125.1 (CH) and 156.7 (C). These two signals, associated with the carbonyl signal at δ 192.7, indicated an R,â-unsaturated carbonyl system.22,25,26 The high-field region exhibited signals assignable to two methyl groups at δ 28.3 and 21.6 and two methoxyl groups at δ 52.5 and 56.2. The assign- ment of all signals observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 8 was corroborated by HMQC and HMBC experiments (Figure 1). The HMBC spectrum showed the correlation of the signal at δ 192.2 (C-1′) with the hydrogens at δ 8.18 (H-6), 8.06 (H-4), and 6.53 (H-2′) and between δ 166.6 (C-6′) and 8.18 (H-6) and also with 3.86 (OCH3). Finally, the cross-peaks observed between δ 156.7 (C-3′) and 2.20 (H-4′) and 1.96 (H-5′) confirmed the structure of 8 as methyl 2-methoxyl-5-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate, named aduncumene. Compound 18 was obtained from the leaves of P. host- mannianum, as a white amorphous powder. Its LRESIMS data associated with 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) and elemental analysis indicated a molecular formula of C13H18O5. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3463 cm-1), an aromatic ring (1613, 1440 cm-1), and a carbonyl group (1715 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals assignable to three coupled aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.76 (d, J ) 9.0 Hz), 7.72 (dd, J ) 9.0 and 2.0 Hz), and 7.77 (d, J ) 2.0 Hz), characteristic of the 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. In addition, this spectrum displayed three singlets at δ 1.27 (3H), 1.30 (3H), and 3.80 (3H) assigned, respectively, to two methyl groups attached to an oxygen-bearing carbon and to one methoxyl group. The presence of an oxymethine hydrogen at δ 3.77 (dd, J ) 6.0 and 4.5 Hz), associated with the signals at δ 3.02 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 4.5 Hz) and 2.73 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 6.0 Hz), suggested a hydroxylated isoprene side chain at C-3 of the benzoic acid nucleus. The HMBC spectrum of 18 (Figure 1) showed correlation between the signals at δ 31.1 (C-1′) and 7.77 (H-2), between δ 69.2 (C-2′) and 1.27 (H-4′)/1.30 (H-5′)/3.02 (H-1′a)/2.73 1784 Journal of Natural Products, 2004, Vol. 67, No. 11 Lago et al. (H-1′b), between δ 25.0 (C-4′) and 1.30 (H-5′), and between δ 22.0 (C-5′) and 3.77 (H-2′)/1.27 (H-4′), confirming the positioning of the vicinal hydroxyl groups at C-2′ and C-3′. The methoxyl group was determined as a methyl ester, considering that a cross-peak between the signals at δ 166.9 (C-6′) and 3.80 (OCH3) was observed in the HMBC spectrum. Therefore, the structure of 18 was determined as methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate, named hostmaniane. Compound 20 was isolated from the leaves of P. gaud- ichaudianum as an amorphous solid. The molecular for- mula C22H28O3 was deduced by LREIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3500, 1681, and 1601 cm-1 assignable to a hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic ring, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at δ 5.58 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and 6.38 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and four singlets at δ 1.41 (3H, s), 1.67 (3H, s), 1.56 (3H, s), and 1.73 (6H, s), which were associated with the chromene/isoprene moi- eties.15,27 Two low-field doublets at δ 7.59 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz) and 7.75 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz), assignable to the meta aromatic hydrogens, indicated a 3,4,5-trisubstituted benzoic acid derivative, which was corroborated by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. A carboxyl group, with a signal at δ 172.1, was placed between the two aromatic hydrogens (C-6). The chromene moiety was confirmed by the presence of signals at δ 79.9, 129.5, and 121.9 assignable to the carbons C-2, C-3, and C-4, respectively.27 The DEPT 135° spectrum confirmed these previous assignments and showed the presence of three methylenes at δ 41.9 (C-1′), 22.7 (C-2′), and 28.2 (C-1′′), which were associated with the respective protons at δ 1.78 (H-1′), 2.25 (H-2′), and 3.28 (H-1′′) by means of the HMQC spectrum. The linkage positions of the two isoprene side chains to the chromene/aromatic ring were determined by an HMBC experiment (Figure 1), in which correlations between the signals at δ 128.9 (C-8) and 5.28 (H-2′′), between δ 131.8 (C-7) and 3.28 (H-1′′), between δ 41.9 (C-1′) and 1.41 (H-9), and between δ 123.9 (C-3′) and 1.78 (H-1′) were observed. Thus, the complete assign- ments of NMR data of 20 were made by analysis of HMQC and HMBC data and by comparison with those obtained for similar compounds isolated from P. lhotzkyanum and P. aduncum.11,28 Therefore, the structure of 20 was deter- mined as 2-methyl-2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl- 2′′-butenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid, named gaud- ichaudianic acid. The optical rotation, [R]25D +21 (c 0.1, CHCl3), was similar to that observed for sargatriol,29 but this compound has two additional chiral carbons (C5′ and C6′) in its side chain and is not appropriate for a direct comparison. Nevertheless, the CD curve obtained for 20 was fully opposite to that described for sargatriol including the positive Cotton effect at 260-280 nm (styrene chro- mophore). Thus, despite the differences in the substitution pattern in the aromatic ring for 20, the S configuration at C-2 was suggested. The antifungal activities of compounds 1-23 isolated from these four Piper species were evaluated against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum7 (Table 1). The fungitoxic potential for the compounds 5, 6, 7, 17, 19, and 21 has been previously reported.10,22,26,27 As can be seen, the chromene 9, crassinervic acid (1), and hostmaniane (18) showed high potential as antifungal compounds and should be further evaluated against other fungi. Several com- pounds, 2, 3, 5, 7, 16, and 19, showed potency (1.0 µg) similar to that of the control. In the prenylated benzoic acid series (1-3) the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the side chain, as in the case of 1, doubled the activity, while the changes in the double-bond configuration (2 and 3) did not cause significant improvement.

The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays, C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491, have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. For the antifungal assay 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 100.0 µg of crude extracts or semipurified fractions were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates, developed with hex- ane-EtOAc (7:3), and dried for complete removal of solvents. For the pure compound 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 50.0, 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 µg were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. cladosporioides or C. sphaerospermum in glucose and salt solution and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C, following the previously reported procedure.10,30,31 Fungal growth inhibition appeared as clear zones against a dark background, indicating the minimum amount of compounds 1-25 required for it (Table 1). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls, whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls. Acknowledgment.

The structures of the new alkaloids were established on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis, mainly 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as high-resolution HRESIMS. Alkaloid 3 showed strong free- radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as well as pronounced anti- oxidant activity evidenced by redox properties measured by ElCD-HPLC. Additionally, alkaloids 1-9 were submitted to TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Both 7 and 8 were shown to be moderate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors at a concentration of 0.1 and 1.0 µM, respectively. In an in vitro rat brain assay, 7 showed moderate activity (IC50 1.86 µM), compared to the standard compound, galanthamine (IC50 0.92 µM). Species of the Rubiaceae have been used for various medicinal purposes throughout the world,1 and our sys- tematic studies on Brazilian plants of this family have revealed marked diversity of the secondary metabolites present and their biological activities.2 In a previous contribution, we reported the isolation, structure elucida- tion, and cytotoxic activity of turbinatine (7), an indole alkaloid isolated from leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata DC. (Rubiaceae).3 As part of our search for bioactive substances from endemic species of the Amazon, C. turbinata was studied further after detection of antioxidant activity in its aqueous and ethanol extracts, indicated by strong free- radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl- hydrazyl (DPPH), as well as significant antioxidant activity determined by redox properties measured by electrochemi- cal detector coupled to an HPLC (ElCD-HPLC). Addition- ally, a TLC screening procedure for acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors was used as a preliminary test to detect potential bioactive compounds to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD).4 The great interest in the search for potential natural AchE inhibitors is due to the recent discovery of galan- thamine, an alkaloid, with long-acting, selective, reversible, and competitive activity as an AchE inhibitor, used as a drug for the treatment of AD. In this paper the details of the isolation and structure elucidation of two new ana- logues of strictosidine (1 and 2), as well as the isolation of six known indole glucoalkaloids (3-8), and the â-carboline alkaloid 9, together with their antioxidant and acetylcho- linesterase inhibitory activity data, are presented. Anti- oxidant indole glucoalkaloids as acetylcholinesterase in- hibitors are being reported for the first time. Air-dried bark and leaves from C. turbinata were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. Both ethanolic extracts were dis- solved in MeOH-H2O 80% and partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. The aqueous phase from the bark extract and the n-BuOH phase from the leaf extract were purified using preparative HPLC, affording alkaloids 1-9. Compound 1 was isolated as a yellowish amorphous solid with strong fluorescence detected at 357 nm, which is compatible with an aromatic 5,6-dihydro-â-carboline chro- mophore, as corroborated by an indole N-H IR band (3370 cm-1). The molecular formula of this alkaloid was deter- mined as C27H32N2O9 (13 degrees of unsaturation) by HRESIMS ([M + H]+ m/z 529.2166). Interpretation of the ion peak at m/z 367.1596 [M - Glc + H]+ suggested the presence of a glucose moiety in 1 and indicated a similarity with the strictosidine pattern of fragmentation.5 A detailed understanding of the molecular structure of this alkaloid was obtained from NMR spectral analysis (Tables 1 and 2). The unsubstituted indole moiety was deduced from the presence of four aromatic hydrogens at δ 7.38 (d, J ) 7.5 Hz), 6.90 (dd, J ) 7.5; J ) 7.5 Hz), 7.02 (dd, J ) 7.5; J ) 7.5 Hz), and 7.20 (d, J ) 7.5 Hz). A singlet at δ 7.72 corresponding to an enolic hydrogen (H-17) and a doublet at δ 5.81 (J ) 9.0 Hz) attributed to a hemiacetalic hydrogen (H-21), in addition to signals for the methylene and methine hydrogens, H-14 and H-15, respectively, and signals for olefin hydrogens, H-18 and H-19, suggested the presence of a seco-iridoid moiety, as in strictosidine-type alkaloids. The 13C NMR data (Table 2) confirmed this assumption. Comparison of the NMR data of 1 with those reported for strictosidine (5)6 indicated in this alkaloid the absence of the signal corresponding to C-3 (δH ) 4.42, δC ) 51.2), compatible with the structure, 3,4-dehydro-stric- tosidine. An additional resonance at δ 138.5 in the 13C NMR spectrum was assigned to C-3 and gave additional support to the proposed structure of 1, which was cor- roborated by COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and NOE experiments * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Nat. Prod. 2004, 67, 1882-1885 10.1021/np049863m CCC: $27.50 © 2004 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 09/25/2004 (Figure 1). COSY and NOESY experiments were funda- mental to assign the relative configuration of C-15, C-20, and C-21 of this alkaloid, which was inferred to have the same stereochemistry as strictosidine. The structure of 1 was thus defined as 3,4-dehydro-strictosidine. Compound 2 was obtained as a pale yellow amorphous powder. HRESIMS analysis gave a protonated molecular ion [M + H]+ peak at m/z 515.2056, corresponding to the molecular formula C26H30N2O9. The IR spectrum showed absorptions at νmax 3440 and 3368 cm-1, indicating the presence of -OH and -NH functions, respectively. Inspec- tion of the NMR data (1H, 13C, DEPT, and 2D experiments) showed a structure similar to 1, including also a glucose moiety, confirmed by the ESIMS fragment ion at m/z 353.1596 [M - Glc + H]+ and NMR data. The only difference in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) of alkaloid 2 was the absence of signals corresponding to a methoxyl group (δH ) 3.69, δC ) 53.0), which is consistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid function, corroborated by the signal at δ 175.0 (CdO) and the IR absorption at 3440 cm-1 assigned to the carboxylic hydroxy group. HMBC cross-peaks (Figure 1) confirmed the 1H and 13C NMR assignments, and the proposed structure for compound 2 as the new 3,4-dehydro-strictosidinic acid. Compounds 3-6 were identified as cordifoline,7 stricto- sidinic acid,8 strictosidine,8 and 5R-carboxystrictosidine,8 respectively, after comparison of their NMR spectral data with reported values. Compound 7 was previously isolated from this plant.3 The â-carboline alkaloids 8 and 9 were identified as desoxycordifoline7 and harman-3-carboxylic acid,9 respectively. After careful analysis of the literature, 13C NMR data for compounds 3 and 9 were found to be unpublished and thus these data are included in Table 2. Compounds 1-9 were tested toward the DPPH radical (Table 3).10 Alkaloid 3 showed strong scavenging activity against the DPPH radical (IC50 18.3 µg/mL) using the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 12.3 µg/mL) as reference, Chart 1 Table 1. 1H NMR Spectral Data for Compounds 1 and 2 in CD3ODa (500 MHz) position 1 2 2 3 5 3.20 m 3.20 m 3.68 m 6 3.40 m 3.45 m 7 8 9 7.38 d (7.5) 7.48 d (8.0) 10 6.90 dd (7.5; 7.5) 7.06 dd (8.0, 8.0) 11 7.02 dd (7.5; 7.5) 7.15 dd (8.0, 8.0) 12 7.20 d (7.5) 7.34 d (8.0) 13 14 2.20 m 2.40 m 15 2.98 m 2.92 m 16 17 7.72 s 7.59 s 18 cis 5.16 d (10.5) 5.25 d (11.0) 18 trans 5.28 d (17.5) 5.35 d (17.5) 19 5.75 ddd (8.0; 10.5; 17.5) 5.92 ddd (8.0, 10.5, 17.5) 20 2.38 m 2.35 m 21 5.81 d (9.0) 5.89 br s 22 OCH3 3.69 s 1′ 4.77 d (8.0) 4.80 d (7.0) 2′ 3.14 m 3.43 m 3′ 3.30 m 3.42 m 4′ 3.16 m 3.28 m 5′ 3.32 br dd (5.7; 6.3) 3.26 m 6′ 3.91 br dd (5.7; 11.0) 4.00 br dd (5.5; 12.0) 3.57 dd (6.3; 11.0) 3.68 dd (6.5; 12.0) a Chemical shifts (δ) downfield from TMS, J couplings (in parentheses) in Hz.

This result indicates that the free-radical scavenging activity of this indole alkaloid is due to its higher hydrogen-donating ability (to DPPH), provided by the hydroxy group at C-10, which results in a more efficient radical-scavenging effect.11 The electrochemi- cal behavior displayed by these alkaloids showed a good correlation with the radical-scavenging effect measured in the DPPH assay, which clearly indicates that substances with oxidative peaks above +1.2V (Table 3) and a small oxidative capacity have weaker radical-scavenging proper- ties than those that are oxidized at lower potentials.12 Compounds 1-9 were submitted to preliminary TLC screening for selecting potential AchE inhibitors,13 in which only compounds 7 and 8 inhibited the enzyme at 0.1 and 1.0 µM concentrations. Due to the limited amount of alkaloid 8, only compound 7 was submitted to further evaluation in an in vitro rat brain assay, to measure its AchE inhibitory potential, and showed a moderate activity (IC50 1.86 µM) when compared with the standard galan- thamine (IC50 0.92 µM). Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter in MeOH at 25 °C, using a sodium lamp operating at 598 nm. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. IR spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 600 spectro- photometer. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian DRX-500 spectrometer, using TMS as internal standard. ESIMS were obtained on a VG Platform Fisons instrument, and HRTOF-ESIMS-MS was performed using a Q-TOF (Micromass) (40 eV) instrument. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-4 (Sigma-Aldrich), and Sephadex LH-20 (Phar- macia). TLC was performed using silica gel 60 (Merck, µ ) 230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 °C and/or Dragendorff reagent. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Prep LC 4000 system (Waters) using C18 (250 mm × 21,20 mm, Luna-Phenomenex) columns. Plant Material. Authenticated Chimarrhis turbinata DC. was collected in Reserva do Viro, Bele´m, PA, Brazil, in February 2000 and identified by Dr. Marina Thereza V. do A. Campos. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sa˜o Paulo (Voucher No. Lopes-51). Extraction and Isolation. Air-dried bark and leaves from C. turbinata were separately powdered and extracted with ethanol. Both ethanolic extracts were dissolved in MeOH-H2O 80% and partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. The n-BuOH fraction (12.3 g) after solvent evaporation was dissolved into H2O (5 mL) and submitted to filtration over XAD-4 eluted with H2O, MeOH-H2O (20-100% gradient), acetone, MeOH-CH2- Cl2 (1:1), CH2Cl2, and Et2O. The subfractions obtained (A-K) were compared by TLC and revealed with specific reagents to alkaloids (Dragendorff). Fractions A (5.0 g), B (700.0 mg), and C (253.0 mg) were purified. Fraction A was submitted to VLC (vacuum-liquid chromatography) using octadecylsilane silica and gradient elution of decreasing polarity with H2O, MeOH, acetone, and CH2Cl2 to give seven fractions. Fraction A4 (660.0 mg) was purified by HPLC using MeCN-H2O-AcOH Table 2. 13C NMR Data for Compounds 1-3 and 9 in CD3OD Solutionsa carbon 1 2 3 9 1 136.1 s 2 135.2 s 136.2 s 137.2 s 3 138.5 s 148.0 s 141.9 s 141.7 s 4 115.4 d 4a 127.0 s 4b 121.3 s 5 48.2 t 48.0 t 136.8 s 122.1 d 6 28.0 t 16.9 t 116.3 d 120.1 d 7 107.9 s 105.8 s 138.9 s 128.3 d 8 127.5 s 127.3 s 123.0 s 112.1 d 8a 140.8 s 9 119.1 d 119.1 d 122.5 d 9a 136.4 s 10 120.5 d 120.6 d 114.3 d 11 123.7d 123.4 s 153.8 s 12 112.2 d 112.3 d 106.6 d 13 138.2 s 138.2 s 132.2 s 14 35.0 t 35.2 t 33.5 t 15 32.6 t 35.0 t 35.3 t 16 108.2 s 112.3 s 109.6 s 17 157.1 d 153.6 d 155.0 d 18 119.7 t 119.1 t 120.0 t 19 135.2 d 136.3 d 135.0 d 20 45.3 d 45.6 d 45.5 d 21 97.3 d 96.8 d 97.2 d 22 172.0 s 175.0 s 169.1 s CH3 20.2 q COOH 167.0 s 166.7 s OCH3 53.0 q 51.8 q 1′ 100.4 d 100.3 d 100.3 d 2′ 74.6 d 78.6 d 78.6 d 3′ 77.9 d 77.9 d 77.9 d 4′ 71.7 d 71.7 d 71.6 d 5′ 78.8 d 74.7 d 74.6 d 6′ 63.0 t 63.0 t 62.9 t a Chemical shifts (d) downfield from TMS, 125.77 MHz.

Determination of the Radical-Scavenging Activity. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a stable radical in methanol (200 µmol, 2 mL). The reagent was added to 1 mL aliquots of compounds 1-9, previously dissolved in methanol, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 µM. Each mixture was shaken and held for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin was used as a standard compound. DPPH solution (2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as control. The evaluation of the reduced form of DPPH generated in situ was performed measuring the decrease in the current (I) on the electrochemical cell of the ElCD.10 The areas obtained in each chromatogram were normalized and compared with the one obtained for the blank. The radical- scavenging activity of the samples was expressed in terms of IC50 (concentration in µM required for a 50% decrease in current (I) by the reduced form of DPPH). Redox Potential. The determination of the optimal poten- tial (Eox) required to apply on each compound was obtained by means of hydrodynamic voltammograms generated for each compound10 (Table 3). TLC Screening Assay for Acetylcholinesterase Inhibi- tors. Samples were dissolved in MeOH or in MeOH-CH2Cl2 mixtures to 0.1 and 1.0 mM concentrations. Physostigmine and galathamine were used as reference compounds in two con- centrations (0.1 and 0.01 µM). After application of 2 µL of each sample on a silica gel plate, it was sprayed with DTNB/ATCI reagent (1:1 solution of 1 mM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 1 µM acetylthiocholine iodide in buffer) until saturation of the silica. The plate was allowed to dry for 5 min, and then 3 U/mL of enzyme solution was sprayed. After a while, a yellow background appeared, with white spots showing the inhibitory compounds.4 Evaluation in a Rat Brain Assay.

The isolates were submitted to in vitro evaluation of lipoperoxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and -2) inhibitory properties and showed moderate antioxidant activities (40–70%) at 100 ppm when compared to commercial standards BHT and vitamin E and moderate inhibition of COX-1 (ca. 40%) and marginal inhibition of COX-2 enzymes (<10%) at 100 ppm when compared to nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin, rofecoxib, and celecoxib, respectively. The chemotaxonomy of widely occurring Senna and Cassia (Fabaceae) species has been the subject of extensive studies, leading to reclassiﬁcation of some species, including Cassia spectabilis.1 Both of these genera exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties and ethnomedical uses, especially those associated with inﬂammation.2–6 In Brazil, the tea of their crushed leaves is used to treat throat inﬂammation and diarrhea.7 Therefore, many plants belonging to Senna and Cassia species have been or are being studied for their anti-inﬂammatory botanical extracts or for the isolation of new metabolites with unique chemical structures, mode of action, selectivity, and/or effectiveness. Extracts of species from both genera have been investigated for anti-inﬂammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. For example, Cassia italica is one of the most studied species due to its analgesic, antipyretic, laxative, and antitumor properties.8 Its ethanolic extract decreased the severity of rat paw edema in a potency comparable to acetylsalycilic acid and inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis by rat peritoneal leucocytes.9 An extract of Senna dariensis has been used against snakebite and was highly active in the inhibition of the hemorrhagic effect of the venom from Bothrops atrox,10 whereas Senna neglecta and Senna alata have been used in southern Brazil and Thailand, respectively, to treat inﬂammation linked to microbial infection.11,12 Cassia tora and C. angustifolia leaf extracts have also shown anti-inﬂammatory properties using in vivo models with histamine-induced rat hind paw edema and 12-O-tetradecanoylphor- bol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema, respectively, whereas C. ﬁstula leaves methanolic extract was evaluated in in vitro models and efﬁciently protected free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in model membranes and also inhibited the 5-lipoxy- genase-mediated peroxidation of arachidonic acid.13–15 As part of our ongoing research on active metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of São Paulo State (Brazil), we have recently reported the isolation of several new piperidine alkaloids including (-)-spectaline (2), (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (3), and (+)-spectaline from leaves, ﬂowers, and ripe fruits of Senna spectabilis, which showed anti-inﬂammatory and acetylcholinest- erase inhibitory properties.16–18 Herein we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new piperidine alkaloid, (+)-3-O- feruloylcassine (1), from unripe fruits of Senna spectabilis ((DC.) Irwin & Barneby), along with the identiﬁcation of the known alkaloids 2 and 3. In addition, we also report their free radical scavenging potential toward DPPH, lipoperoxidation (LPO), and cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitory activities. Compound 1 was isolated as a pale yellow solid (mp 7–74 °C). HRESIMS and elemental analysis of 1 indicated the molecular formula C28H43NO5, with eight degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum suggested the presence of secondary amine (3413, 1514 cm-1), ketone (1710 cm-1), and oleﬁnic (3050, 1629, 1529 cm-1) moieties. The 1H NMR spectroscopic signals for two vicinal oleﬁnic methines at δ 7.68 (d, J ) 15.5 Hz, H-7′′) and δ 6.36 (d, J ) 15.5 Hz, H-8′′) with a trans relative conﬁguration, three aromatic methines at δ 7.06 (brs, H-2′′), δ 7.00 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, H-6′′), and δ 6.82 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, H-5′′), and three methoxyl protons at δ 3.81 (s, H-10′′) suggested a feruloyl moiety in compound 1. This spectrum also gave signals for one oxymethine hydrogen at δ 4.99 (brs, H-3), three methyl protons at δ 1.19 (m, H-7), and two methines at δ 3.14 (m, H-2) and 2.80 (m, H-6). The two multiplets at δ 1.62 and 1.48, integrated for four protons, were assigned to H-4eq/H-5eq and H-4ax/H-5ax, respectively, on the basis of correla- tions observed in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum. Signals for methylene protons at δ 1.48 (m, H-1′), 1.16–1.21 (m, H-2′-H-9′), and 2.34 (t, 7.5 Hz, H-10′) and methyl protons at δ 2.06 (s, H-12′) clearly indicated a long saturated side chain as previously observed in compounds 2 and 3.16 The 13C NMR and DEPT-135° spectra showed signals for three methine carbons at δ 69.0, 56.9, and 54.4, * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Prod. 2007, 70, 2026–2028 2026 10.1021/np070312g CCC: $37.00 2007 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 11/30/2007 methylene carbons at δ 29.1–29.7, and one methyl carbon at δ 16.9, which strongly supported the 2,6-disubstituted-piperidin-3-ol ring similar to those reported for (-)-spectaline (2) and (-)-3-O- acetylspectaline (3)16 (Figure 1). The joint analysis of the 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and HMBC spectra evidenced signals for a carbonyl carbon at δ 209.6, correlating to methylene protons at δ 2.34 and to methyl protons at δ 2.06, which were assigned to a terminal methyl ketone subunit on the side chain at C-6. The carboxyl signal at δ 166.7 correlated to the oleﬁnic methine at δ 7.68 in the HMBC spectrum and suggested an R,- unsaturated conjugation between the piperidine unit and the 1,3,4- trisubstituted aromatic ring. The downﬁeld value of the methine carbon at δ 69.0, when compared to that in (-)-spectaline (δ 67.9), and its correlation with the H-7 methyl protons led us to propose a conjugated ester at C-3 on the piperidine ring. The HMBC correlations observed for the methoxy protons at δ 3.81 to the quaternary carbon at δ 147.0 and for the aromatic methines H-2′′ (δ 7.06), H-5′′ (δ 6.82) to the carbon at δ 148.3 evidenced the presence of aromatic methoxy and hydroxy substituents at C-3′′ and C-4′′ (Figure 1). The NOESY 1D experiment indicated the position of methoxy at C-3′′ and hydroxy at C-4′′ on the basis of the sole spatial correlation of the methoxy protons and H-2′′. All of these assignments were conﬁrmed by additional HMBC cor- relations and led us to propose the structure of 2-methyl-3-feruloyl- 6-(dodecyl-11′-one)piperidine for compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed by the molecular ion peak at m/z 474.3198 in its HRESIMS. The relative conﬁgurations at C-2, C-3, and C-6 were established by comparison of the coupling constants observed for 1 with those published for 2 and 316,19 and NOESY 1D experiments. The irradiation of the H-2 signal conﬁrmed its relative spatial correla- tions to H-3, H-4ax, H-6, and H-7 protons as cis. Therefore, the structure of 1 was assigned as (+)-2-methyl-3-feruloyl-6-(dodecyl- 11′-one)piperidine. The free radical scavenging activity of compounds 1–3 was evaluated spectrophotometrically by using the stable free radical DPPH and measuring the decrease in absorption at 517 nm. Compounds 2 and 3 were weakly active in this assay and exhibited absorbance variation lower than 10% at 60 ppm. However, compound 1 showed moderate activity (%∆A ) 40% at 60 ppm) when compared to the standard rutin (%∆A ) 92% at 60 ppm), which may be associated with the presence of a feruloyl moiety in the structure of 1. The lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity of the isolates was evaluated by measurement of the ﬂuorescence decay after adding Fe2+ to initiate the oxidation of large unilamellar vesicles. The alkaloids were tested at 100 ppm, the extract was tested at 250 ppm, and commercial antioxidants BHT, BHA, and vitamin E were used as standard reference compounds at 1.9, 2.2, and 4.3 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids 2 and 3 exhibited moderate inhibition (ca. 75% after 21 min, Figure 2) of the liposome peroxidation. Alkaloid 1 showed only 50% inhibition of the LPO, despite the presence of a feruloyl moiety in its structure, which is normally associated with an increase in antioxidant activity. This behavior might be at least partly explained by the possible chelation of Fe2+ ions by compounds 2 and 3, in contrast to the poor ability for Fe2+ chelation of compound 1. The use of AAPH as the free radical initiator, instead of Fe2+, conﬁrmed this observation by showing a similar trend in lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (ca. 50%) by compounds 1–3. Inhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzyme activity of compounds 1-3 was evaluated by polarographic measurement of the oxygen uptake during the COX-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Each alkaloid was tested at 100 ppm and compared to standard reference compounds rofecoxib, celecoxib, and aspirin, which were tested at 1.7, 1.7, and 108 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids 1-3 inhibited COX-1 enzyme by 33, 40, and 58%, respectively. However, the inhibitory activities of COX-2 enzyme by these compounds were marginal (Figure 3). In summary, we have isolated three alkaloids (1–3) from the green fruits of S. spectabilis, which showed weak to moderate free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH and moderate lipoper- oxidation inhibitory properties. In addition, these compounds displayed moderate anti-inﬂammatory activities, especially toward COX-1. Additional research is needed to further explain the anecdotal medicinal claims of this fruit and its potential to be considered as a medicinal or dietary supplement. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were mea- sured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 °C. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X FT spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using the ESI mode and MeOH-H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V). Al2O3 grade I, type WN-3 and silica gel (200–400 mesh) were used in column chromatography and TLC; visualization of TLC plates was made by spraying with iodochloro- platinate reagent (Merck) and Dragendorff’s reagent.

Plant material was collected in February 2004 from a specimen of Senna spectabilis cultivated in the Chemistry Institute at Sao Paulo State University (Araraquara-SP). A voucher (SP 370917) was deposited at the herbarium of São Paulo Botanic Garden, São Paulo-SP, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. Green fruits of S. spectabilis (8 kg) were ground and extracted with EtOH (5 × 5 L). Evaporation of solvent yielded 676 g of a crude extract (8.5%). The extract was analyzed by TLC (silica gel, CHCl3-MeOH-NH4OH, 36:3:1) to conﬁrm the presence of alkaloids by spraying with Dragendorff and iodochloro- platinate reagents. This extract (9 g) was then suspended in MeOH-H2O, 4:1, the insoluble residue was removed by ﬁltration, and the remaining solution was partitioned successively with hexanes, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. Analysis of the organic fractions by TLC revealed that most of the alkaloidal constituents were concentrated in the CH2Cl2 fraction (5.7 g). An aliquot of the CH2Cl2 fraction (1 g) was then fractionated by neutral alumina column chromatography (hexanes/Et2O and Et2O/MeOH gradients) to give 30 fractions. Fractions 1–3 (30.4 mg) were further puriﬁed by neutral alumina column chromatography (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 99:1) and gave compounds 2 (3.4 mg) and 3 (9 mg). Fractions 28–30 (402.6 mg) showed strong UV absorption at 254 nm. An aliquot (200 mg) of this mixture was puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc-MeOH-TEA, 90:9.9: 0.1) to give alkaloid 1 (20.2 mg).

(Rubiaceae) have been examined.1-5 Previous phytochemical studies of C. turbinata established the presence of indole alkaloids with weak antic- holinesterase activity2 as well as several phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties.3,5 Herein, the isolation, structural elucidation, and conformational analysis of a new C6.C3 lignan skeleton type (1) are reported. We have previously described the isolation of the two known phenolic compounds 2 and 3.4,6 Herein, their antioxidant proper- ties along with those of compound 1 are reported and compared with those of the commercially available antioxidant BHT. Evaluation of the parameters related to the antioxidant activity was accomplished by measuring the free radical scavenging ability of the compounds toward DPPH.7 The liquid-liquid partitioning of the EtOH extract of air-dried leaves of C. turbinata, followed by a sequence of size exclusion chromatography oftheEtOAc-soluble fractiononSephadex LH-20 and further puriﬁcation using C18 HPLC, eluted with a CH3CN/ H2O (18:88 v/v) isocratic elution using a Phenomenex Luna column (25.0 mm 21.20 mm 5 μm) at a ﬂow rate of 10 mL min-1 and UV detection at 280 nm, aﬀorded compound 1. Compound 1was obtained as an amorphous, pale brownpowder, [R]D 25 -204 (c 0.01, MeOH), which was analyzed for C29H28O12 by a combination of HRESIMS and 13C NMR data. The molecular formula of 1 was determined from the [M - H2O]þ peak at m/z 550.6433 (calcd for C29H26O11 550.1475). The IR spectrum with absorption bands at 3403, 1705, 1657, and 1627 cm-1 suggested the presence of phenolic and carboxylic groups. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) displayed signals for nine aromatic hydrogens, which indicates the presence of three aromatic ring systemswithdiﬀerentsubstitutionpatterns.Thesignalsatδ7.31(d, J = 2.0 Hz), 7.33 (ddbr, J = 2.0; 2.0 Hz), and 7.23 (s) corresponded to the aromatic hydrogens of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted ring. Addition- ally, the signals at δ 6.78 (d, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.69 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.61 (J = 8.0 Hz), 6.67 (dd, J = 8.0; 2.0 Hz), 6.55 (sbr), and 7.32 (d, br, J = 8.0 Hz) were attributed to six aromatic hydrogens from 1,3,4- trisubstituted rings. These 1H NMR data clearly conﬁrm the presence of three distinct aromatic moieties in 1. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed signals for 29 diﬀerent carbons: 11 quaternary (sp2), two of which are carbonyls (δ 176.5, C-9; 173.6, C-7a), one quaternary (sp3); nine sp2 methines; four sp3 methines, three of which are oxymethine; and four methylenes, one of which is a sp3 methines. The signals at δC 146.0, 146.5, 116.8, 115.7, 123.8, 146.7, 146.0, 115.2, 116.5, and 121.7 were ascribed to two 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic systems characteristic of a catechol moiety.8 The signals at δC Special Issue: Special Issue in Honor of Koji Nakanishi Received: October 16, 2010 ABSTRACT: A lignan with a new skeleton named chimarrhinin (1) was isolated from an extract of the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata, a Rubiaceae plant species. 13C NMR spectrometric techniques including 1D and 2D experiments and HRESIMS provided unequivocal structural conﬁrmation of this new C6.C3 skeleton type. The relative conﬁguration of 1 was established by 2D 1H-H analysis and J couplings, while its conformation was evaluated through molecular modeling using the RM1 semiempirical method, with the aid of coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. The antioxidant activity of the new derivative 1 and two known and previously isolated phenolic derivatives (2 and 3) was investigated. An IC50 value of 7.50 ( 0.5 μmol L-1 was obtained for the new derivative 1, while 2 and 3 showed IC50 values of 18.60 ( 0.4 and 18.50 ( 0.6 μmol, respectively. 488 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np1007476 |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 487–491 Journal of Natural Products NOTE 117.7, 151.3, 115.7, 151.3, and 117.7 evidenced the presence of one 1,3,5-substituted aromatic ring.9 The signals at δC 63.3, 70.2, 71.2, and 81.5 were assigned to a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran moiety. The signal at δC 91.7 revealed a peculiar downﬁeld shifted carbon, which, analyzed together with the signals at δC 28.5, 41.3, 43.2, and 173.6, allowed us to attribute one part of the structure of 1 as being a trisubstituted lactone moiety (Table 1). Detailed analysis of the 1H-1H COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra demonstrated that 1 bears a diﬀerent skeleton, with two C6.C3 units similar to those found in lignoids. Correlations between H-7 (2H, δ 3.06, d, J = 13.0; 17.5 Hz), H-8 (δ 4.22, dd, J = 13.0; 9.0 Hz), H-90 (2H, δ 2.70 and 2.75, J = 8.5 Hz), and H-80 (δ 3.33, m) were observed by 1H-1H COSY. The hydrogen at δ 3.06 (H-7) has HMBC correlations with the aromatic carbon at δ 125.6 (C-1) and with a quaternary carbon at δ 176.5 (C-9), as well as a correlation with a methine carbon at δ 43.2 (C-8). Correlations of the methylene hydrogen resonating at δ 3.33 (H-80) with C-10 and C-90 and correlations of H2-90 with C-80 and C-70 are also evident. The hydrogen at δ 4.66 (H-2b) correlates with C-70 and C-3b. From these observations and the analysis of all 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1), it is evident that the two caﬀeic acid units and a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system are connected to the δ-lactone moiety. These data suggest the presence of a δ-lactone moiety linked at C-10 (ring C) and at C-2b (ring B), Figure 2. The anisotropic unshielded signals of the quaternary carbon C-7 (δ 91.7) might be explained by its ligands: oxygen, the aromatic carbon C-10, and C-2b. The correlations between H-2b (δ 4.66, d, J = 8.5 Hz), H-3b (δ 3.68, dd, J = 2.5; 8.5 Hz), H2-4b (δ 3.57, ddd, J = 2.5; 6.0; 6.5 Hz and δ 3.41, dd, J = 6.5; 11.0 Hz), and H2-5b (δ 3.32, m) indicate that ring B consists of a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system, biogenetically derived from a tetrose sugar unit (Figure 2). HMBC correlations from the aromatic hydrogens at δ 7.33 (H-2a) and 7.31 (H-6a) of the third 1,3,5-trisubstituted aromatic ring (A) with C-7a (δ 176.5) showed that the third aromatic system is the 3,5-dihydroxylbenzoic ester moiety at C-3 of the tetrose ring (B) (Figure 2). These observations and the presence of two caﬀeic acid moieties, which could be biogenetically deﬁned as a neolignan, determined a skeleton formed by unusual couplings C-7-C-90 and HOC-9-C80. The spectroscopic evidence and a literature survey of lignan types (neolignans and lignans) indicated that compound 1 has a new neolignan-type skeleton. The relative conﬁguration of the sterocenters at C-2b, C-3b, C4-b, C-70, and C-8 and the conformation of 1 were determined on the basis of coupling constants and conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. For C-2b and C-3b, the coupling constants of H-2b (δ 4.66 d, J = 8.5 Hz) and H-3b (δ 3.68 dd, J = 8.5, 2.5 Hz) indicate a vicinal H-2bax-H- 3bax position, which is in good agreement with the presence of the gallate moiety in the β-position at C-3b. For C-4b, the coupling constants of H-4b (δ 3.56 ddd, J = 6.5, 6.75, 2.5 Hz) also conﬁrm an R-hydroxy group at this position. The 1H NMR data recorded in methanol-d4 clearly show all the coupling constants of H-4b with Hax and Heq-5b (Table 1) and conﬁrmed the tetrose moiety as part of this molecule. The coupling constants of H-8 (δ 4.22 dddbr, J = 9.0, 13.0 Hz) suggest the R-positioned 8-R, which is in accordance with the relative conﬁguration of C-8. The relative conﬁguration is assigned as 2R*, 3R*, 4S*, 70S*, and 8R*. To conﬁrm the relative conﬁguration of C-2b, C-3b, C-4b, and C-8 and in order to establish the conformation of 1, this structure was submitted to conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. The obtained minimum energy conformations enable estimation of 3JHH coupling constants by means of the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation,10 which considers the electronegativity of the substit- uents and the geometry of the H-C-C-H dihedral angle. A comparison between the theoretical and experimental coupling constants permitted the characterization of the conformation of chimarrhinin, represented in Figure 3, with the respective theoretical coupling constants (Table 1), considering the most stable envelope conformation of the tetrahydrofuran ring and half-chair conformation of the tetrahydro-2-pyranone ring. Con- sistent with previous conformational analyses of natural products with diverse skeletons,1,11,12 the employed semiempirical calcu- lations agreed with experimental data more satisfactorily when compared with older Hamiltonians such as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G** calculations. The radical scavenging eﬀects observed for compounds 1-3 assayed with DPPH are summarized in Table 2, the standard antioxidant BHT (IC50 62.50 ( 0.6 μmol L-1), and chlorogenic acid (IC50 20.0 ( 0.2 μmol L-1) used as reference. The results indicate that the free radical scavenging activity of these mole- cules is due to their hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the stabilization of the phenoxy radical after DPPH reduction. Stabilization is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and, in the case of the phenylpropanoids (2, 3), the R,β- unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by their IC50 values. Compound 1 gave the best results, with an IC50 value lower than that of the standard BHT, a well-known food antioxidant. This result may be related to the presence of two catechol groups in this molecule. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotation measure- ments were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz cuvette (length 1 cm). IR spectra were measured on either a Perkin- Elmer 1600 or a Nicolet EMACT-40 FTIR spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and at 125 MHz for 13C. TMS was used as internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained at high resolution on a Micromass Q-TOF spectrometer. For chromatographic procedures, Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) was employed. Preparative HPLC separations were performed on a Varian Prep LC 4000 System, and C18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns and precolumns were utilized. Figure 1. Compounds from C. turbinata. 489 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np1007476 |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 487–491 Journal of Natural Products NOTE Peaks were detected using a Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All solvents (Merck or Mallinckrodt) were analytical or HPLC grade. The theoretical study was carried out using the semiempirical RM1 method on MOPAC 7.0 software. Plant Material. Chimarrhis turbinata was collected in Reserva do Viro, Belem, PA, Brazil, in February 2000, and identified by Dr. Marina Thereza V. do A. Campos. A voucher specimen, Lopes-51, was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, S~ao Paulo. Extraction and Isolation. Dried and powdered leaves of C. turbinata (1.2 kg) were exhaustively extracted with EtOH at room temperature to afford 57.1 g of dry residue, which was dissolved in MeOH/H2O (8:2, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane. The aqueous alcoholic fraction was evaporated to roughly MeOH/H2O (6:4, v/v) and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. All fractions were screened with β-carotene and DPPH assays, aiming at selecting potential antioxidant compounds. The EtOAc layer was active in these assays, and this extract was selected for guided fractionation. The dried EtOAc extract (4.16 g) was dissolved in MeOH (5 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20. A total of 25 fractions of 25 mL each were collected and pooled according to their TLC profiles (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O, 65:30:5). Fractions A-6,7 and A-8 to A-12 exhibited antioxidant activity and were further purified by HPLC. Fractions A-8 to A-12 yielded the compounds described elsewhere.3,4 Fraction A-6,7 (0.699 g) was puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration over Sephadex LH-20 CC (88.0 cm 2.0 cm), which was eluted with MeOH, giving 36 Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Spectral Data for 1 in Methanol-d4 a gHMQC position δC δH (J in Hz) J (Hz)b theor gHMBC COSY TOCSY 1 125.6 H-7 2 116.8 6.78 d (2.0) n.d.c H-5 3 146.7 H-2 4 146.0 H-5, H-6 5 115.7 6.69 d (8.0) n.d.

The fractions B-20-30 (0. 387 g) tested positively in the β-carotene and DPPH assays, and they were further combined and subjected to preparative HPLC separation using CH3CN/H2O isocratic elution (18:88) [Phenomenex C18 Luna col- umn 25.0 mm 21.20 mm 5 μm, at 10 mL.min-1, with UV detection at 280 nm], to aﬀord 10 subfractions. From those, C-3 (97.2 mg) was separated by preparative HPLC using the same column described above [isocratic elution; H2O/MeCN/HOAc (84.5:15:0.5), UV detection at 237 nm, 12.0 mL min-1 ﬂow rate], to give compound 1 (4.3 mg). Molecular Modeling. The semiempirical calculations were car- ried out using the RM1 Hamiltonian13 within the MOPAC 7.0 program.14 The MOLDEN program was employed as a graphic interface for construction and visualization of the structure of compound 1.15 Hessian matrix analyses were used to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. Additionally, the minimum energy achieved by RM1 was further refined through ab initio calculations, using the GAMESS program16 at the HF/ 6-31G** level. In order to obtain theoretical 3JHH coupling constants for the minimum energy conformation achieved by conformational analysis, the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation15 was applied to the H-C-C-H dihedral angle geometries. Bleaching Experiments Using β-Carotene. After being de- veloped and dried, TLC plates were sprayed with 0.02% β-carotene solutions (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of the background. The remaining yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.7 Determination of the Radical Scavenging Activity. The DPPH radical was used in MeOH (100 μmol L-1). The reagent (2.0 mL) was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds previously dissolved in MeOH, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 μmol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and kept at room temperature for 30 min, in the dark. Chlorogenic acid and BHT were employed as standards. A DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in MeOH (1.0 mL) served as a control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured at 517 nm using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer, and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH-treated control group.

The clerodanes are a group of diterpenoids with interesting biological eﬀects such as antifungal,14 antileish- manial and antiplasmodial,15 antimalarial and antimycobac- terial,16 antitumor,17,18cytotoxic,1,14,16,19-31immunomodulatory,32 and trypanocidal activities.33 In our continuing investigation of the bioactive clerodane diterpenes from Casearia species, we undertook the ﬁrst phytochemical investigation of Casearia rupestris Eichler. This shrub or small tree grows up to 6.0 m in height and is found in Brazil (Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais States) and Bolivia (Sta. Cruz State) in the Cerrado, grasslands, and sometimes pastures, at altitudes of 350-500 m.34 Investiga- tion of the cytotoxic Et2O fraction yielded four new clerodane diterpenes (1-4) (Figure 1). Compounds 1 and 4 were acety- lated, resulting in two new derivatives (5, 6) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic activity of the diterpenes (1-6) against a panel of human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MDA/MB-435, HCT-8, and SF-295) has been evaluated. ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Investigation of the Et2O phase of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. rupestris led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, casearupestrins A-D (1-4). 2,7-Di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6) were obtained by acetylation of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. The structures (Figure 1) of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric data (IR, UV, NMR, and MS) and by comparison with NMR data of reported compounds.6 Casearupestrin A (1) was obtained as a white, amorphous solid ([R]24 D þ4.3 (c 1.0, MeOH)). The molecular formula Received: November 17, 2010 ABSTRACT: Four new clerodane diterpenes, casearupestrins A-D (1-4), were isolated from the leaves of Casearia rupestris. Compounds 1 and 4 were acetylated to yield 2,7-di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Casearupestrin A (1) exhibited the most potent activity against MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) cells, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin. 777 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 776–781 Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE C34H48O9 was determined by HRESIMS, based on the sodiated ion peak at m/z 623.3190 [M þ Na]þ (calcd 623.3190), which implies 11 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the presence of carbonyl esters (1746 and 1712 cm-1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions at λmax 223 nm (log ε 1.40) and 268 nm (log ε 1.50), corresponding to diene and dienone chromophores, respectively. The 13C and DEPT 135 NMR data showed the presence of 34 carbons divided into seven quaternary (including three carbonyl carbons), 13 methine, nine methylene, and ﬁve methyl carbons. The oleﬁnic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) revealed proton signals with characteristic cis/trans coupling at δH 5.06 (1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz, H-15), 5.30 (1H, d, J = 17.5 Hz, H-15), and 6.47 (1H, dd, J = 10.5, 17.5 Hz, H-14), indicating a terminal monosubstituted oleﬁnic moiety. Another terminal methylene, identiﬁed by two singlets at δH 4.94 and 5.03 (2H, H-16), was connected to a quaternary carbon (C-13). An additional oleﬁnic doublet was observed at δH 6.04 (1H, d, J = 4.0 Hz, H-3) and correlated to a methine carbon at δC 128.6 (C-3) in the gHMQC spectrum. Two deshielded acetal protons were observed at δH 6.35 (1H, t, J = 1.5 Hz, H-18) and 6.49 (1H, s, H-19), which correlated to methine signals at δC 96.3 and 99.8, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed the presence of two methyl groups at δH 1.06 (1H, brd, J = 4.0 Hz, H-17) and 1.07 (1H, s, H-20) and three oxymethines at δH 4.45 (1H, brt, J = 4.0 Hz, H-2), 5.18 (1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz, H-6), and 3.66 (1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz, H-7). The spectroscopic data of 1 (Tables 1 and 2) are in accord with the basic skeleton of clerodane diterpenoids previously isolated from Casearia species.10,18,35 The acyclic moiety at C-9, including the diene group, was deduced from the correlations of H-12 with C-11, H-14 with C-13 and C-16, H-15 with C-13 and C-14, and H-16 with C-14 (Figure 2). The position of the hydroxy group at C-7 was deduced by the long-range correlation of the oxy- methine signal at δH 3.66 (H-7) with δC 77.5 (C-6), 44.8 (C-8), and 11.7 (C-17) (Figure 2). A decadienoate moiety, identiﬁed by gHMBC and gCOSY correlations (Figure 2), was characterized by a Z- (δH 5.68, J = 11.5 Hz; 6.69, J = 11.5 Hz) and an E-double bond (δH 7.37, J = 14.0, 11.5 Hz; 6.16, J = 14.0, 7.0 Hz) and a triplet methyl (δH 0.98, J = 7.0 Hz). This same 2Z,4E-decadienoate unit has been veriﬁed in other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C. pitumba and C. arguta.6,36 Its position was determined at C-6 (δC 77.5), on the basis of the long-range correlation observed in the gHMBC spectrum between the oxymethine proton (H-6) and the carbonyl carbon (δC 167.3, C-10). Finally, since H-19 (δC 6.49) was correlated with the carbonyl group (δC 171.4) of one acetate unit, the second acetate unit (δC 171.8 and 21.0) must be located at C-18 (Figure 2). The relative conﬁguration of 1 was determined by using coupling constants, 1D-NOE data, and 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table 1 and Figure 3). The trans conﬁguration between the C-17 and C-20 methyl groups was shown by the chemical shift at δC 26.4 for C-20, which also supported a cis-A/B ring junction.3,5,10 The J values of 3.5 and 13.5 Hz for the coupling of H-10 and H-1 revealed that H-10 (rel-R) is in the axial position. The NOE enhancement between H-19 and H-10, and H-19 and H-7, indicated the same R-orientation to H-19 and H-7 (Figure 2). The large coupling constant between H-6 (δH 5.18 - 1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz) and H-7 (δH 3.66 - 1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz) supported their 1,2-diaxial relationship. The NOE interaction between H-6 (rel-β) and H-8 implied that H-8 and Me-17 were at axial and equatorial positions, respectively. A small coupling constant of 4.0 Hz for H-2/H-1 suggested an equatorial orientation for H-2 (rel-β), which was conﬁrmed by the broad triplet at δH 4.45 and the chemical shift of C-2 at δC 64.2. From the allylic coupling between H-3 and H-18 (J = 1.5 Hz) and NOE enhancement observed between H-18 and H-6 it can be deduced that H-18 also has a β-orientation. Therefore, casearupestrun A (1), a new clerodane diterpenoid, was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,- 8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-6-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,7-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The MS, UV, and IR data and the speciﬁc rotation value of casearupestrin B (2) were comparable with those of 1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Tables 1 and 2) revealed the same substituents and substitution patterns. However, changes in the chemical shift values related to H-6 (δH 3.75 - 1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz) and H-7 (δH 5.15 - 1H, t, J = 10.5 Hz) required placement of the decadienoate ester at C-7. The structure 2 was corroborated by the same correlations observed for 1 in the gHMQC, gHMBC, andgCOSY (Figure 2). The observed NOESY interactions and coupling constants for casearupestrin B (2) indicate the samerelative conﬁguration as 1 (Figure 3 andTable 1). Hence, casearupestrin B (2) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R, 9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,6-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The structures of the remaining two compounds can be ration- alized by comparison with the previous ones. Analysis of the NMR data of compound 3 revealed a strong similarity to com- pounds 1 and 2. However, the molecular formula C33H48O8, determined by the HRESIMS, revealed a sodiated ion peak at m/ z 595.3241 [M þ Na]þ, which implied 10 degrees of unsaturation. The main diﬀerence observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 3 in relation to compounds 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and 2) was the presence of signals at δH 3.36 (1H, s) and δC 55.4. These signals indicated that an acetoxy group at C-18 was replaced by a methoxy group, which was conﬁrmed by the gHMBC correlation between H-18 and the methoxy group. The relative conﬁguration of 3 was identical to 1 on the basis of the same NOESY interac- tions (Figure 3) and coupling constants. Thus, casearupestrin C (3) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-19-acetoxy-18, Figure 1. Structure of the clerodane diterpenes from Casearia rupestris. 778 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat.

Compound 4 had the molecular formula C36H50O10, deter- mined by HRESIMS (observed m/z 665.3297 [M þ Na]þ). The 1H and 13C NMR data of 4 (casearupestrin D) (Tables 1 and 2) were similar to those of 2 except for replacement of a hydroxy group at C-6 by an acetoxy group [δH 1.95 (3H, s), δC 171.5, δC 20.9]. The 1H and 13C NMR assignments of compound 4 were conﬁrmed by 2D NMR correlations, and its conﬁguration was established by the sign of the speciﬁc rotation, NOESY interac- tions, and coupling constants (Figure 3). Thus, casearupestrin D (4) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-6,18, 19-triacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)-decadienoyloxy]-2-hydro- xyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. Acetylation of 1 and 4 with Ac2O-pyridine yielded two new clerodane diterpenes derivatives, 5 and 6, respectively (Tables 1 and 2, NMR data). The products were named 2,7- di-O-acetylcasearupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearu- pestrin D (6). Theresultsofthebiologicaltestsofcompounds1-6areshownin Table 3. Casearupestrins A (1), B (2), and D (4) showed signiﬁcant cytotoxicity against four cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC50 values ranging from 0.10 to 1.3 μM. Com- pound 1 had an IC50 value of 0.36 μM against MDA/MB-435 and SF-295 cancer cell lines, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (Table 3). Acetylation of compounds 1 and 4 resulted in decreased cytotoxicity (Table 3), indicating that the C-2 OH group is essential for the cytotoxicity of these compounds. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 LC polarimeter. UV spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 A spectrometer.

Positive-ion HRMS spectra were recorded on an UltrOTOFq (Bruker Daltonics) ESI-qTOF mass spectrometer, using TFANa as the internal standard. Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 with UV-vis detector (model 330), using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Open column chromatography was performed over silica gel (40-63 μm, Merck) or silica C18 (40 μm, J. T. Baker) or on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were observed under UV light and by spraying the plates with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent, followed by heating at 120 C. Plant Material. Casearia rupestris leaves were collected in May 2007 in Campinas municipality, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil. The plant material was identified by one of the authors (R.B.T.). A voucher specimen (IAC41542) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Agron^omico de Campinas (S~ao Paulo State). Extraction, Isolation, and Chemical Transformation. The dried and ground leaves (0.46 kg) were exhaustively extracted by successive maceration with hexanes, EtOH, and H2O (3.0 L 3) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was concentrated under reduced pressure at 40 C to yield 30.0 g of a crude extract. This extract was then diluted with MeOH-H2O (3:1) and successively partitioned with hexanes (1.0 L 3), Et2O (1.0 L 3), and EtOAc (1.0 L 3). After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 10.8, 3.2, and 1.2 g, respectively. Part of the cytotoxic Et2O (3.0 g) fraction was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (78.0 3.0 cm) eluted with MeOH, to afford 38 fractions. These fractions were combined on the basis of their TLC profiles. Fraction 12 (1.7 g) was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel-C18, 78.0 3.0 cm, Table 2. 13C NMR Data for Compounds 1-6 (methanol-d4, 125 and 75 MHz, δ)a position 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.5, CH2 27.8, CH2 27.8, CH2 2 64.2, CH 64.2, CH 64.3, CH 64.0, CH 67.5, CH 67.4, CH 3 128.6, CH 127.0, CH 126.5, CH 129.3, CH 125.2, CH 125.3, CH 4 141.9, C 143.5, C 144.0, C 141.1, C 144.2, C 144.1, C 5 54.3, C 55.2, C 55.1, C 54.3, C 54.3, C 54.2, C 6 77.5, CH 75.2, CH 75.3, CH 75.8, CH 74.2, CH 75.6, CH 7 72.2, CH 76.1, CH 76.1, CH 73.5, CH 74.7, CH 73.4, CH 8 44.8, CH 43.1, CH 43.0, CH 42.7, CH 42.5, CH 42.5, CH 9 39.8, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 40.2, C 10 37.2, CH 36.5, CH 36.3, CH 37.3, CH 38.3, CH 38.3, CH 11 29.4, CH2 29.5, CH2 30.5, CH2 30.5, CH2 30.6, CH2 30.6, CH2 12 25.0, CH2 25.1, CH2 25.0, CH2 25.0, CH2 25.1, CH2 25.1, CH2 13 147.0, C 146.9, C 147.0, C 146.8, C 146.6, C 146.6, C 14 141.5, CH 141.6, CH 141.6, CH 141.5, CH 141.4, CH 141.4, CH 15 113.2, CH2 113.1, CH2 113.1, CH2 113.2, CH2 113.2, CH2 113.2, CH2 16 115.5, CH2 115.7, CH2 115.6, CH2 115.1, CH2 115.9, CH2 115.9, CH2 17 11.7, CH3 11.5, CH3 11.5, CH3 11.3, CH3 11.3, CH3 11.3, CH3 18 96.3, CH 97.2, CH 105.7, CH 96.0, CH 96.0, CH 95.9, CH 19 99.8, CH 100.1, CH 99.7, CH 99.5, CH 99.5, CH 99.5, CH 20 26.4, CH3 26.2, CH3 26.3, CH3 26.0, CH3 25.8, CH3 25.8, CH3 10 167.3, C 168.0, C 168.0, C 167.4, C 166.8, C 167.4, C 20 115.9, CH 116.3, CH 116.3, CH 115.7, CH 114.6, CH 115.1, CH 30 147.7, CH 147.1, CH 147.1, CH 148.1, CH 148.9, CH 148.2, CH 40 128.3, CH 128.3, CH 128.2, CH 128.0, CH 128.1, CH 128.0, CH 50 147.2, CH 146.9, CH 146.8, CH 148.0, CH 148.5, CH 148.0, CH 60 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 33.9, CH2 70 30.5, CH2 30.6, CH2 29.5, CH2 29.4, CH2 29.3, CH2 29.4, CH2 80 32.4, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 32.5, CH2 90 23.4, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.5, CH2 23.4, CH2 23.5, CH2 100 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 14.3, CH3 2-O2CCH3 172.1, C 21.0, CH3 172.1, C 21.0, CH3 6-O2CCH3 171.5, C 20.9, CH3 171.6, C 20.6, CH3 171.5, C 20.9, CH3 18-OCH3 55.4, CH3 18-O2CCH3 171.8, C 21.0, CH3 172.0, C 21.0, CH3 171.9, C 20.9, CH3 172.0, C 20.9, CH3 171.8, C 20.9, CH3 19-O2CCH3 171.4, C 21.8, CH3 171.5, C 21.8, CH3 171.9, C 21.9, CH3 171.9, C 21.9, CH3 170.9, C 21.7, CH3 171.0, C 21.7, CH3 a 13C NMR data were assigned by DEPT-135 and gHMQC experiments; multiplicities were determined with the assistance of DEPT-135 and 90 experiments. 780 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J.

Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes (1-6) was tested against four tumor cell lines: SF-295 (human glioblas- toma), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), HL-60 (human leukemia), and MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM gluta- mine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 C with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 μL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 μg/mL) dissolved in DMSO were added to each well. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 μg/mL) was used as the positive control. The proliferation of tumor cells was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan pro- duct. At the end of 69 h incubation, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL of MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA).37 ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.

Additionally, four known polyketides, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methoxyeugenin (6), and 9- hydroxyeugenin (7), were also isolated. The structural characterization of compounds was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy, time- dependent density functional theory calculations, and X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1−9 were weakly active when tested in antileishmanial and cytotoxicity assays. E ndophytic microorganisms live inside the tissues of host plants without apparently harming them and are a promising source of bioactive compounds.1−4 Species of Mycoleptodiscus, such as M. indicus, M. terrestris, and M. sphericus, are commonly isolated as endophytes; they are probably latently phytopathogenic and may become phytopa- thogenic when the host plant is subjected to stress.5 M. indicus, a tropical to subtropical species, occurs in leaves of diﬀerent host plants, mainly monocotyledons. M. indicus is associated with large spreading lesions on leaves of Zamia spp., an American cycad, and other monocotyledonous plants.6 M. indicus has occasionally been reported to infect humans and canines, causing septic arthritis and skin infections.7 In this paper, the isolation, structural characterization, and biological activity of secondary metabolites from cultures of M. indicus, an endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves from Borreria verticillata (Rubiaceae), are reported. Three new azaphilones, named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5), were isolated and fully characterized; in addition, four known polyketides, namely, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methox- yeugenin (6), and 9-hydroxyeugenin (7), were isolated and identiﬁed, and the acetylated derivatives of austdiol (8) and mycoleptone A (9) were synthesized (Figure 1). ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seven secondary metabolites of M. indicus were isolated, four of which were identiﬁed as austdiol, eugenitin, 6-methoxyeugenin, and 9-hydroxyeugenin by comparison of experimental spectro- scopic data with literature values.8−13 Austdiol ((7R,8S)-7,8- dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-6-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromene-5- carbaldehyde) is the main toxic component of a mixture of compounds produced in moldy maize meal by Aspergillus ustus and belongs to a class of compounds known generically as azaphilones.14,15 Azaphilones are yellow or orange pigments produced by fungi: their pyran oxygen atoms are easily exchanged to nitrogen atoms with ammonia, and the name is derived from the ready reaction of these metabolites with ammonia to yield vinylogous γ-pyridones.16 The skeleton of austdiol is derived from a single pentaketide chain, composed of Received: August 22, 2013 Published: January 3, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/jnp © 2014 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy 70 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np4006822 | J. Nat. Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 head-to-tail acetate units, and possesses two C1 units introduced from S-adenosylmethionine.17 A wide range of interesting biological activities of azaphilones, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, cytotoxic, nematicidal, and anti-inﬂammatory, have been reported in the literature;14,17 their nonselective biological activities may be related to the production of vinylogous γ-pyridones.18 Three of the isolated metabolites are previously unreported azaphilones and were named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5). Mycoleptone A (2) was isolated as a yellow powder, and the complete structural characterization was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high- resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy, time-dependent density func- tional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction studies (Figure 2). The UV spectrum of 2 displays maximum absorptions at 254 nm (log ε 2.90) and 361 nm (log ε 2.83), revealing the presence of an extended conjugated system, characteristic of azaphilones. Compound 2 displays similar 1H and 13C NMR spectra to austdiol,8,9 with the replacement of the aldehyde signals (δH 9.99 and δC 189.3) by methylene signals (δH 3.26 and δC 18.5) at position C-5. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibits two signals at δH 7.30 and 6.25 due to hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring, two hydroxyl hydrogens at δH 5.66 (OH, d, J = 4.6 Hz) and 4.93 (OH, s), a methine signal at δH 4.22 (1H, d, J = 4.6 Hz), a methylene signal at δH 3.26, and two methyl signals at δH 2.07 and 0.91. The 13C NMR spectrum displays signals for 12 carbons atoms, 11 of which refer to two atoms each: two signals due to methyl carbon atoms (δC 19.2 and 18.8), ﬁve signals from the skeleton of the pyran rings (δC 157.8; 143.5; 141.0; 120.7 and 104.6), and four signals from the skeleton of the cyclohexenone, with one signal due to ketone carbonyl groups (δC 197.8; IR νmax 1667 cm−1), one due to quaternary unsaturated carbon atoms (δC 112.7), and two due to oxygenated carbon atoms (δC 75.6 and 71.0). The remaining signal refers to a methylene group (δC 18.5). The heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) spec- trum shows key correlations of CH2-10 to C-4a, C-5, C-6, C- 4a′, C-5′, and C-6′, revealing the attachment of two azaphilone units through a methylene bridge at position C-5 (Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of four hydroxyl groups was conﬁrmed by acetylation with pyridine−Ac2O to aﬀord the tetraacetylated derivative (9). NMR spectroscopy identiﬁes the structure of 2 as being formed by two austdiol units linked by a methylene group, generating a compound with the molecular formula C23H24O8 as determined by HRMS ([M + H]+ at m/z 429.1543). The chemical structure explains the simplicity of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, in which the signal intensities are doubled, except for the methylene group. Compound 2 is a chiral molecule having four asymmetric carbons and a formal binary symmetry axis. An accurate analysis of the eight enantiomeric pairs of 2 reveals that two pairs are formed by nonoptically active meso structures and two more pairs are repeated twice; as a result, four pairs of enantiomers and two meso structures are possible. Since the reliable assessment of the absolute conﬁguration of a compound is achieved when the theoretical chiroptical properties19 of all the possible optically active diastereomers are determined,20 quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations were performed on four diastereomers of 2 (Figure 3): (7R,8S,7′R,8′S)-2 (2A), (7R,8S,7′R,8′R)-2 (2B), (7R,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2C), and (7S,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2D). QM calculations were carried out Figure 1. Mycoleptones A−C and polyketides from Mycoleptodiscus indicus. Figure 2. ORTEP representation of mycoleptone A (atom displace- ment at 30% probability). Hydrogen atoms are represented by spheres of arbitrary radius. Journal of Natural Products Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/np4006822 | J. Nat. Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 71 using density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent extension (TD-DFT); detailed results are reported in the Supporting Information. DFT geometry optimization (Table 2) yielded two equilibrium conformers having ΔEQM ≤2 kcal mol−1 for diastereomers 2A, 2B, and 2C, while a single equilibrium conformer within the same threshold energy was found for diastereomer 2D. The most populated conformers of 2A (Figure 4) display similar geometric features: the azaphilone units are oriented in an “open folder” conformation, the pyran oxygen atoms are pointing toward opposite directions, and all the hydroxy groups are equatorial and form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with each other and with the ketone carbonyl groups. The main diﬀerence lies in the direction of the axial methyl groups on C-7 and C-7′, which point outside the molecular cavity for 2A-e and inside for 2A-b. The experimental ECD spectrum of 2 in methanol (Figure 5) shows four bands. The broad positive band centered at 372 nm has a strong contribution from the n →π* transitions of the ketone carbonyls, which are aﬀected by the chiral environment around these groups. The positive band at 311 nm with a shoulder around 285 nm, the sharp negative peak at 252 nm, and the positive peak at 228 nm are due to π →π* transitions of the conjugated system, which are aﬀected by the chirality of the rings and by the mutual orientation of the azaphilone units. The theoretical ECD spectra of the diastereomers of 2 (Figure 6) displayed diﬀerent patterns, reﬂecting their diﬀerent stereochemistry. The comparison between the calculated spectrum of 2A and the experimental spectrum of 2 (Figure 7) shows that TD-DFT calculations are able to reproduce the experimental pattern of the transitions in the high-energy region, considering that transition energies are usually underestimated by PBE0.21 The transitions in the low- energy region are not reproduced, suggesting that QM calculations are unable to describe the chiral environment of the ketone moieties, in particular hydrogen-bonding inter- actions with hydroxy groups and solvent molecules, with adequate accuracy. On the other hand, the theoretical ECD spectra of the remaining diastereomers (reported in the Supporting Information) are unable to reproduce the experimental ECD pattern in the high-energy region: on this basis, a (7R,8S,7′R,8′S) absolute conﬁguration can be predicted for 2. Compound 2 crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2); the X-ray geometric parameters selected for comparison with the precursor austdiol are listed in Table 3. The C-5−C-10 distance was elongated upon change of hybridization to sp3 for atom C-10, and the C-5−C-4a distance was shortened, increasing the double-bond character. The pyran rings are almost planar with an rmsd from the mean plane of 0.03 Å, while the cyclohexenone rings adopt a twisted envelope conformation with atoms C-7 and C-7′ as ﬂap atoms. The X-ray structure of 2 shows that the azaphilone units have the same absolute conﬁguration as austdiol,22 retaining the stereochemistry of the chiral centers as (7R,8S); moreover, Table 1.

On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the structure of mycoleptone A (2) was therefore elucidated as (7R,8S,7′R,8′S)-5-[(7′,8′-dihydroxy-3′,7′-dimeth- yl-6′-oxo-7′,8′-dihydro-6′H-isochromen-5′-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihy- droxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromen-6-one. The molecular formula of mycoleptone B (4) was determined as C23H24O8 by a combination of HRMS, 1H and 13C NMR, homonuclear correlation (COSY), heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC), and HMBC spectros- copies. The 1H NMR spectrum contains ﬁve doublets, four singlets, two double doublets, and one multiplet; some similarities with the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 are observed, with the presence of two hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring at δH 7.43 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz) and 6.63 (1H, s), an oxygenated sp3 methine group at δH 4.42 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz), a CH2 group at δH 3.60 (1H, d, Jgem = 15.0 Hz) and 3.53 (1H, d, Jgem = 15.0 Hz) due to the methylene bridge at position C-10 connecting the azaphilone unit to a dihydroisocoumarin moiety, and two methyl signals at δH 2.22 and 1.10. For the dihydroisocoumarin moiety, the 1H NMR spectrum displays an oxygen-bearing methine hydrogen at δH 4.55 (1H, m), a methylene group at δH 3.17 (1H, dd, J = 16.0, 3.0 Hz) and 2.60 (1H, dd, J = 16.0, 11.0 Hz), and two methyl groups at δH 2.06 (3H, s) and 1.44 (3H, d, J = 6.2 Hz). The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 displays signals for 23 carbon atoms: one signal due to the methylene bridge (δC 20.7), 11 signals belonging to the azaphilone moiety as in 2, Figure 3.

The structural features of the lactone ring were determined from the 1H−1H COSY spectrum based on the couplings between H2-4′ and H-3′, as well as between H-3′ and H3-9′. The HMBC correlations of CH2-4′ to δC 136.8 (C-5′), δC 100.1 (C-8a′), δC 75.0 (C-3′), and δC 19.6 (C-9′) proved the connection of the two units. In addition, the HMBC spectrum displays relevant correlations from CH2-10 (δH 3.60, 3.53) to δC 199.3 (C-6), 143.7 (C-4a), and 112.8 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δC 160.9 (C-8′), 160.2 (C-6′), and 116.5 (C-7′) from the dihydroiso- coumarin moiety, characterizing the connection between the two units by a methylene bridge to aﬀord the compound (7R,8S)-5-[(6′,8′-dihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethyl-1′-oxoisochroman- 7′-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-iso- chromen-6-one. The molecular formula of mycoleptone C (5) was deduced as C23H22O8 by HRMS analysis in combination with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The 1H NMR spectrum displays nine singlets and two doublets; as in compounds 2 and 4, the methylene group at δH 3.74 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) and 3.46 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) connects two moieties, the azaphilone and chromone units. The azaphilone moiety shows ﬁve uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δH 7.52 (H-1), 7.03 (H-4), 4.25 (H-8), 2.25 (H-9), and 1.00 (H-10); the chromone moiety displays four uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δH 13.06 (H-5′), 6.13 (H-3′), 2.37 (H-9′), and 2.00 (H-10′), the sharp singlet at δH 13.06 being interpreted as a hydrogen-bonded phenol hydroxy group. The 13C NMR spectrum conﬁrms 23 carbon signals, namely, four methyl, one methylene, four methine, and 14 quaternary carbon signals. The chromone moiety displays one ketone carbonyl group (δC 181.8; IR νmax 1690 cm−1) and four quaternary aromatic (δC 153.5, 107.8, 105.0, and 103.1), two oxygenated aromatic (δC 161.1 and 156.6), two unsaturated (δC 167.2 and 107.9), and two methyl (δC 20.2 and 8.5) carbon atoms. The structure of the chromone portion was determined on consideration of the molecular formula, double-bond equivalents, and the downﬁeld shifts of the carbon signals at C-2′ and C-8a′ (δC 167.2 and 153.5). The HMBC spectrum of 5 revealed relevant correlations of CH2-10 (δH 3.74, 3.46) to δC 200.5 (C-6), 144.3 (C-4a), and 112.1 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δC 161.1 (C-7′), 156.6 (C-5′), and 107.8 (C-6′) from the chromone moiety, revealing the Figure 5.

The presence of a methylene bridge is very uncommon among natural compounds, and only a few azaphilone dimers have been reported showing such a feature.15 Dicitrinones A− C23 were isolated from Penicillium citrinum, a volcano ash- derived fungus: the presence of a single sp3 carbon bridge, either a methine or methylene group, was proposed to derive from the carboxyl group of citrinin through decarboxylation, reduction, and Friedel−Crafts alkylation mediated by a polyketide biosynthetic pathway. The methylene bridge in aspergilone B,24 an azaphilone dimer that was isolated from a marine-derived fungus of the Aspergillus species, was hypothe- sized to derive from a formaldehyde biosynthetic pathway; the same hypothesis was proposed for the biosynthesis of xyloketal F,25 a dimer isolated from a mangrove fungus of the Xylaria species. The condensation of two austdiol units to form mycoleptone A (2) is consistent with a possible biosynthetic pathway similar to the one proposed for dicitrinone C23 (Figure 8). One austdiol unit may undergo decarbonylation, while the aldehyde group of the second austdiol unit may be reduced to a reactive carbocation species: the two units may then react by Friedel− Crafts alkylation. Similar pathways may also explain the condensation of the dihydroisocoumarin and chromone units with an austdiol unit in mycoleptones B (4) and C (5), respectively. Due to the limited number of methylene-bridged azaphilones discovered to date, however, a general biosynthetic pathway cannot be postulated, and the biologically mediated mechanisms of such reactions are unknown. The results of antileishmanial and cytotoxicity tests on the isolated compounds are shown in Table 4. Compounds 1−9 exhibit no signiﬁcant activity against Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major compared to the standard antileishmanial drugs Geneticin (L. major), amphotericin B, and pentamidin (L. donovani). Mycoleptone B (4) was the most cytotoxic metabolite (PC3 cells: IC50 = 7.1 ± 3.8 μM), but its activity was lower than that of doxorubicin, the reference compound for cytotoxicity assays. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured in CHCl3, MeOH, or DMSO using a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter at room temperature; IR spectra were recorded with KBr discs using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer. UV spectra were measured in CHCl3, MeOH, and DMSO on a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV−visible spectrophotometer. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp multisolvent delivery system, a SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector, an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection, and processing, and a Shim-pack CLC- ODS(M) reversed-phase column (250 × 4.5 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size) protected by a Pelliguard LC-18 cartridge. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 13C NMR in CDCl3, CD3OD, or DMSO-d6; multiplicity determinations (DEPT) and 2D NMR spectra (COSY, HMQC, and HMBC) were obtained using standard Bruker pulse programs. The chemical shift values (δ) are given in parts per million (ppm), and the coupling constants are in Hz. HRMS were obtained by direct injection using a Bruker Bioapex FTMS spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI). UV and ECD spectra of 2 in MeOH (sample concentration: 19 μM) were recorded in the 500−215 nm spectral range on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter, using a 1 cm path length cell at room temperature: measurements Figure 8.

Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 75 were carried out at 0.2 nm intervals using a 1 nm spectral bandwidth, a 20 nm min−1 scan rate, and a 4 s time constant. Fungal Material. The fungus was isolated as an endophyte from the medicinal plant Borreria verticillata (L.) G. F. W. Meyer, belonging to the Rubiaceae family, and is native to South America. Five specimens of B. verticillata with a healthy appearance were collected from the campus of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) (34°56′57″ W; 8°2′53″ S) in January 2006, approximately 43 cm in height and bearing ﬂowers. Then, the samples were taken to the laboratory and processed in 24 h. A voucher specimen of the plant (No. 42.234/UFPE) was identiﬁed and deposited at the Herbarium Professor Geraldo Mariz, UFP, Department of Botany, UFPE, Recife, Brazil. The isolate was identiﬁed as Mycoleptodiscus indicus based on sequence analysis of the ITS region of the rDNA (GenBank accession number GU220382.1). Cultivation, Extraction, and Isolation. M. indicus was grown on potato dextrose agar plates for 7 days at 30 °C. Then, 10 plugs were transferred to ﬁve Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 100 mL of potato dextrose broth prepared with distilled water. Flasks were shaken on a rotary shaker at 30 °C and 120 rpm for 48 h. Next, 10 mL was transferred to each of 50 ﬂasks containing 90 g of solid medium (rice-oat). These were grown for 30 days. On day 30, the mycelial mass was macerated with ethanol overnight and ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was concentrated under vacuum to obtain a crude ethanol extract (22 g), which was partitioned with three times equal volumes of hexane and CH2Cl2, respectively, yielding hexane (6 g) and dichloromethane fractions (6.9 g). The CH2Cl2 fraction was suspended in MeOH and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, furnishing a precipitate fraction (3870 mg) and a soluble fraction (3030 mg). The precipitate fraction was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (30 × 3.5 cm i.d.) using a MeOH−CH2Cl2 gradient to yield 67 fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles into seven fractions: A (19 mg), B (33 mg), C (2968 mg), D (100 mg), E (210 mg), F (285 mg), and G (109 mg). Fraction C (2968 mg) yielded austdiol (2830 mg), after crystallization in MeOH, and fraction E aﬀorded mycoleptone A (2, 200 mg) by precipitation. The soluble fraction (3030 mg) was subjected to gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 × 3 cm i.d.) using MeOH as the mobile phase, furnishing 10 fractions (S1−S10). Fraction S6 (280 mg) was washed with MeOH, yielding eugenitin (50 mg). The soluble portion was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) using a MeOH−CH2Cl2 gradient. Forty-two fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles to yield nine fractions. The fourth fraction (S6.4, 28 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane−ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to furnish mycoleptone B (4, 10 mg) and mycoleptone C (5, 2 mg). Fraction S5 (461 mg) was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) eluted with a gradient of MeOH in CH2Cl2. Thirty fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles to yield 10 fractions. The fourth fraction (S5.4, 60 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane−ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to provide 6-methoxyeugenin (14 mg). The ﬁfth fraction (S5.5, 4 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using CH3CN−H2O (10:90 to 100:0, v/v) as mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min over 23 min, yielding 9-hydroxyeugenin (2 mg). Acetylation of Austdiol and Mycoleptone A (2). A solution containing austdiol (80 mg), pyridine (2 mL), and Ac2O (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. H2O (6 mL) was added into the reaction mixture, which was subsequently extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was evaporated to give a yellow, amorphous solid (140 mg), which was puriﬁed by preparative TLC eluted with a mixture of CH2Cl2−MeOH (98:2, v/v) to aﬀord the diacetylated derivative (8, 80.7 mg). Acetylation of mycoleptone A (2, 25 mg) was performed in a similar manner, yielding the tetraacetylated derivative (9, 20 mg). Quantum-Mechanical Calculations. Conformational analysis on the selected diastereomers of 2 was performed in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, a preliminary conformer distribution was determined by molecular mechanics (MM) calculations at the MMFF94s26 level using the Spartan’02 software.27 In the second step, DFT28,29 geometry optimizations were performed on the MM conformers having relative energies (ΔEMM) within a threshold value of 3 kcal mol−1. DFT calculations were carried out at the B97D/6-311+ +G(2d,2p) level30−33 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 The Boltzmann distribution of conformers at 298.15 K and 1 atm was then calculated from the relative electronic energies (ΔEQM). TD-DFT35 calculations were carried out at the PBE0/6-311++G(2d,2p) level31−33,36−38 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 All calculations were performed using the IEFPCM continuum solvation model39,40 for MeOH. Rotational strengths (Rj) and excitation wavelengths (λj) were calculated for the lowest 50 excited states on the optimized geometries having ΔEQM ≤2 kcal mol−1. Theoretical ECD spectra were then obtained by approximation of Rj values to Gaussian functions with a half-bandwidth at Δεmax/e (Δσ) of 0.3 eV, summation over all excited states, and conformational averaging, according to the Boltzmann distribution of conformers (χQM).41 Crystallographic Structure. Crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by crystallization from a methanol solution. A colorless prismatic crystal of approximate dimensions 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3 was used for the experiment. X-ray data were measured on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diﬀractometer employing graphite-monochro- mated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 298 K and operating in the φ−ω scan mode. Crystal data: C23H24O8, M = 428.42, triclinic, space group P1, a = 10.473(6) Å, b = 11.223(3) Å, c = 11.429(2) Å, α = 60.65(2)°, β = 89.83(3)°, γ = 67.75(4)°, V = 1055.5(9) Å3, Z = 2, Dc = 1.348 g/cm3, F(000) = 452, and μ(Cu Kα) = 0.86 mm−1. All tested crystal samples showed gemination, and the sample used for data collection was visually homogeneous, but it showed pseudomerohedral twinning, which caused partial superposition of structure factors leading to high residuals during the structure reﬁnements. A total of 8384 reﬂections were collected (4273 unique plus 96.2% of Friedel mates) in the θ range 4.56° to 73.92° and index ranges h from 15 to −15, k from −24 to 25, and l from −15 to 15. Cell reﬁnement and data reduction were performed with the XCAD4 software suite. The structure was solved and reﬁned using the WingX with SHELX97 suite.42,43 Structure reﬁnement was performed on F2 by full-matrix least-squares calculations. Non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned aniso- tropically, and all hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized coordinates and reﬁned as riding atoms with isotropic parameters relative to their parent atoms. The ﬁnal reﬁnement residuals were R1 = 0.091 (wR2 = 0.32) for 6964 observed reﬂections with I > 2σ(I), 575 variable parameters, and three restraints, being R1 = 0.11 (wR2 = 0.32) for all unique reﬂections with GoF = 1.41. The absolute structure Flack parameter was 0.1(3), indicating that the chiral sense was correctly chosen, although this number was not reliable, given the large standard deviation, in the absence of strong anomalous scatterers. Biological Assays. The microplate Alamar-Blue assay was used to determine growth inhibition against L. donovani.44 Antileishmanial (L. major) and cytotoxicity assays against human colon cancer (HCT-8) cells, human leukemia cancer (HL-60) cells, human melanoma cancer (MDA-MB435) cells, human prostate cancer (PC3) cells, human glioblastoma cancer (SF-95) cells, and human lymphocyte cells were assessed employing a colorimetric method.45 Austdiol (1): yellow crystal; mp 255−257 °C; [α]25 D +223 (c 1.0, DMSO); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 212 (2.64), 255 (2.57), 333 (2.62) nm; IR (KBr) νmax 3470, 3373, 3100, 1679, 1604, 1471 cm−1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR reported in the Supporting Information; HRMS m/z 237.0759 [M + H]+ (calcd for C12H12O5 + H+, 237.0757).

August 1992 MOLLUSCICIDAL ACRIDONE ALKALOIDS FROM ANGOSTURA PANZCULATA: ISOLATION, STRUCTURES, AND SYNTHESIS PAULO C. VIEIRA, ISAO KUBO* Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natwal Resomes, Uniwsity of Califmnia, Bn;bley, Califmnia 94720 HIROSHI KUJIME, YOSHIRO YAMAGIWA, and TADAO KAMIKAWA+ Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Tabnology, Kinki Unimity, Kowaka, Higasbiosaka-shi, Osaka 5 77, Japan ABSTRACT.-TWO novel acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [l] and cusculine [2], were iso- lated from the CH,CI, extract of the leaves ofAngostwapanirrrlataa (Rutaceae). Their structures were established as l-hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethoxy-9-acridone for 1 and 1,2,3,5,6-pen- tamethoxy-9-acridone for 2 by means of spectroscopic studies, in particular nmr. These struc- tural assignments were confirmed by synthesis, using a direct metallation method as a key reac- tion. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against an aquatic snail, B i a - phalaria glabratu, and cytotoxicity against several types of carcinoma cell lines. We have recently described the isolation of various alkloids from Brazilian Rutace- ous plants: two molluscicidal quinoline alkaloids from the leaves of Gafipeu brarteata (l), and two insect-growth-inhibitory 4-quinolinone alkaloids from the leaves of Esen- hkia feiocarpa (2). In our continuing search for biologically active phytochemicals, two novel acridone alkaloids have been isolated from the leaves of another Brazilian Rutace- ous plant, Angosturapanicufata (Engler) Elias. These alkaloids exhibited moderate mol- luscicidal and cytotoxic activities and were designated cuspanine El} and cusculine [21. Their structures were established based largely on nmr studies. However, the structures established are rather uncommon among the known acridone alkaloids. Therefore, in order to confirm the structures, their syntheses were carried out. This paper reports the isolation, structure determination, and syntheses of 1 and 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION After repeated and various column chromatographies, the CH,Cl, extract of the leaves ofA. panicufata yielded two new acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [I] and cusculine 121. In conjunction with both 'H- and ',C-nmr and eims data, the molecular formula C1,Hl,NO6 was assigned to cuspanine 111. In addition, together with the uv and ir data, an acridone-type structure could be assigned to cuspanine. This was apparent be- cause keto group signals, characteristic of acridone at 6 181.14 (s) and 1635 cm-', were observed. The presence of a free phenolic group was deduced from the uv spectrum by using AICI, as the shift reagent. Thus, when afew drops ofAIC1, solution was added to cuspanine in MeOH, a typical bathochromic shift was observed. However, the re- gion of 3000-3600 cm-' in the ir spectrum showed only weak and broad absorption, because the phenolic group forms a stable 6-membered ring intramolecular hydrogen bond with the keto group. The 'H-nmr spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic proton sig- nals at 6 6.92 and 8.06 ( J = 8.0 Hz for each) which can be attributed to H-7 and H-8, respectively (3). This indicated the tetrasubstituted nature of ring C. The remaining signal at 6 6.23 (s) could be attributed to the aromatic proton at either H-2 or H-4. This was confirmed by 'H nmr using nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY). In the NOESY spectrum of cuspanine, an nOe was observed between the aromatic proton H-4 at 6 6.23 and the amine proton at 6 8.44. This result, itself, was conclusive for the assignment of the remaining proton to the 4 position in ring C.

Therefore, the structure 1 was proposed for cuspanine. Cusculine E21 is very closely related to cuspanine Ill. The only difference observed in the 'H-nmr spectrum was an additional peak for an M e 0 group, suggesting the pres- ence of five M e 0 groups in the molecule. In addition to this observation, the batho- chromic shift observed in the uv spectrum of 1 was not detected with 2, indicating that an Me0 group was substituted for the phenolic group of 1. This was further supported by the 13C-nmr spectrum which showed three signals in lower field at 6 61.89, 61.53, and 60.94, indicating the presence of three hindered Me0 groups (4) and leading to structure 2 for cusculine. Cuspanine 121, 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone, was synthesized from 2- bromo-3,Cdimethoxybenzoic acid [6]. The first method that was tried for the prepara- tion of 6 was the bromination of isovanillin in refluxing CHCI,, followed by methyla- tion (Me,S04) and oxidation (Jones' reagent). However, the bromination gave a poor yield (18%), so the following alternate approach, using a directed metallation method, was adopted. 1114 Journal of Natural Products Wol. 55, No. 8 The methoxymethyl ether (MOM ether) 141, prepared from 3,4dimethoxybenzyl alcohol [3] and methoxymethyl chloride, was lithiated in Et,O with n-butyllithium at 0\". The resulting yellow precipitates were treated with 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane (5) at -78', and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature to give a bromide 5 with a 66% yield. Hydrolysis of the MOM ether of 5 with HBr in warm EtOH, fol- lowed by oxidation with Jones' reagent, gave 6 in a 69% yield. Ullmann condensation (6) of 6 and 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline [7l in the presence of freshly prepared copper powder and K,C03 in DMF gave 8 with a 56% yield appearing as orange plates. Treat- ment of 8 with polyphosphoric acid and xylene (7) at 150' gave 2 in the form of yellow prisms with a yield of 55%. Selective hydrolysis of the 1-MeO group of 2 was achieved by refluxing in MeOH with concentrated HCl and 70% HC104 to afford 1 (Scheme 1). The physical data for both 1 and 2 were identical with those of the natural products. The structure of 1 was unambiguously determined by a single crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 1). FIGURE 1. Molecular structure of 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acri- done [Z] from X-ray crystallography. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail Bimphakaria gkbrata. The LC5, of cuspanine fl] was 5 ppm and that of cusculine 121 was 20 ppm. There are only a few examples in the literature (8,9) where alkaloids exhibiting high toxicity to snails are observed. These two alkaloids also showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several carcinoma cell lines. The IC5,'s of 1 and 2 against HeIa epithelioid carcinoma cells were 2.5 and 8.5 pg/ml, respectively. In addition, they also inhibited the growth of BT-20 human breast carcinoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.-AII the pnxedures were the same as previously de- scribed (2). ISOLATION OF CONSTITUENTs.-The leaves ofA. pnicvhtu were collected in Minas erais, Brazil, in February 1988, and identified by Dr. Jd R. Pirani, Instituto de BiociEncias, Universidade de So Paulo, So Paulo, SP. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium ofthis institute. The dried pul- verized leaves were first extracted with CH2C12 followed by MeOH at ambient temperature. A subsequent molluscicidal bioassay using B . gkzbrata indicated the CH2CI, extract to be active. The CH2CI, extract (2.983 g) was chromatographed over Si gel, using CH,CI,, EtOAc, and MeOH. This process yielded 11 fractions. The bioactive fraction, eluted with EtOAc, was rechromatographed over Si gel (Lichroprep), af- fording c u s p i n e [l] (60 mg). The fractions eluted with MeOH after the same procedure gave cusculine 121 (200 mg).

CELL LINES AND MEDIA.-AII cell lines used for the assay were purchased from American Type Cul- ture Collection (Rockville, MD). They are HeLa ATCC CCL 2 19, epithelioid cerevix carcinoma from human, and BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma from human. Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-in- activated fetal calf serum, and incubated in a humidified atomosphere of 5% C02-95% air at 37\". These human monolayer cultures were subcultured with a 0.25% trypsidEDTA solution. CYTOTOXICITY ASSAY.-The cytotoxicity assays were performed by a microculture tetrazolium (h4YY) (Sigma) method (12). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtitre plates at 4@304000 celldwell, with various concentrations ofthe samples. After incubation, 50 pl MlT(3 mglml in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye ws solubilized by adding 100 pl DMSO to each well, fol- lowed by gentle shaking. The extinction ccef6cient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photome- ter Labsystems, at a wavelength of 620 run. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. Jd R.

The structures of 1-3 were established on the basis of interpretation of spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. All compounds were tested against a bacteria panel consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, B. anthracis, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and M. phlei. Compound 2 showed moderate activity against these strains, with MIC values in the range 7-20 µg/mL. The genus Stemodia Benth. (Scrophulariaceae) is represented by 40 species distributed in Asia, Africa, Australia, and America.1 Iridoids and diterpenes are widely distributed in this genus, with the tetracyclic stemodane diterpenoids being an unusual structural type isolated from Stemodia maritima,2 a plant used medicinally in the Caribbean region to treat stomachache, edema, and swelling.3 Several Stemodia species are shrubs distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world.4 In Brazil, Stemodia foliosa Benth., known as “meladinha”, is widespread, and in the north- eastern region, it is used popularly as a bioinsecticide and to treat respiratory infections.5 Our previous investigation on S. foliosa resulted in the isolation of stearic acid 4-[(n-pentoxy)phenyl] ester, which showed signiﬁcant activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis and the fast-acid bacterium Myco- bacterium fortuitum.6 In the course of a program aimed at identifying new bioactive compounds from Brazilian plant species, we have investigated the ethanolic extract from the aerial parts of S. foliosa. This has led to the isolation of three new labdane diterpenoids, 6R-acetoxymanoyl oxide (1), 6R-malonyloxymanoyl oxide (2), and 6R-malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3), together with several known compounds, betulinic acid, lupeol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol. We report herein the isolation and characterization of 1-3 and their antibacterial properties. The hexane phase obtained from liquid-liquid partition of a bioactive EtOH extract from the aerial parts of S. foliosa gave three new compounds (1-3) after sequential column chromatographic procedures on silica gel. Compound 1 was obtained as a colorless, amorphous solid, with [R]D30 +44.5. Electrospray-ionization MS showed a strong [M - H]+ ion peak at m/z 347 (100), and HRESIMS gave a [M]+ ion at m/z 348.5243, compatible with the molecular formula C22H36O3, which is consistent with a diterpene structure. IR absorptions at 1737 cm-1 indicated the presence of an ester carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) displayed signals corresponding to ﬁve tertiary methyls at δ 1.39 (CH3-17, s), 1.23 (CH3-16, s), 1.00 (CH3-20, s), 0.87(CH3-19, s), and 0.86 (CH3-18, s), three oleﬁnic hydrogens at δ 5.86 (1H-14, dd, J ) 17.0, 11.0 Hz), 4.83 (1H-15, dd, J ) 11.0, 1.5 Hz), and 5.03 (1H-15, dd, J ) 17.0, 1.5 Hz), one oxymethine hydrogen at δ 5.08 (H-6, ddd, J ) 11.5, 11.9, 4.5 Hz), and one acetyl methyl group at δ 2.00 (s). From the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) a labdane diterpene structure type was proposed for 1.7,8 The signals corresponding to oleﬁnic carbons (δ 147.5 and 110.4) of a monosubstituted vinyl group were analyzed together with three oxygen-substituted carbons (δ 70.8, 74.0, 73.5) and one acetoxyl group (δ 170.0, 21.9) and suggested that 1 is a manoyl oxide derivative.9 Also, on the basis of 13C NMR data, the relative stereochemistry of C-16 was deduced, since the value attributed to this carbon is quite different for the manoyl oxide series (C-16, δ ca. 28.5) from that in the epi-manoyl oxide series (C-16, δ ca. 33.0).10,11 This is consistent with the NOESY spectral data (Figure 1). Thus, taking into account these considerations, compound 1 was determined to be a manoyl oxide. The acetoxyl function at C-6 was also established on the basis of 1H and 13C NMR data. The chemical shift of H-6 in conjunction with the coupling constants observed for the signal corresponding to this hydrogen (Table 1) was diagnostic for the attachment of the acetoxyl group in an R-position.12 Additionally, NOESY data permitted the determination of the relative conﬁguration of C-6, C-16, and C-17 (Figure 1), thereby conﬁrming 1 to be a new compound. Total assignments of 1H and 13C NMR signals were also conﬁrmed by the COSY, TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra (Table S1, Supporting Information). Accordingly, diterpene 1 was characterized as 6R- acetoxymanoyl oxide. Compound 2 was isolated as an optically active white solid ([R]D30 +46.9) and exhibited spectroscopic data quite similar to those of compound 1. HRESIMS afforded the molecular formula C23H36O5 and a molecular ion at m/z 392.5341, 44.0098 amu higher * To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: 55 16-33016660. Fax: 55 16-33327932.

Accurate analysis of spectroscopic data including the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) demonstrated that compounds 1 and 2 are closely related, indicating the same diterpene skeleton for 2. The only difference observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 was the singlet signal at δ 3.31, instead of the signal for the acetyl group observed for compound 1. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra revealed the presence of three additional carbons for 2 at δ 173.9 (s), 171.1 (s), and 43.6 (t). These observations together with 1H-1H COSY and HMBC data (Table S2, Supporting Information) indicated that diterpene 2 has a malonyloxy moiety at C-6. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by the HMBC spectrum, due to a 3J cross- peak between H-6 (δ 5.08) and C-1′ (δ 173.9) and a 2J cross-peak between H-2′ (δ 3.31) and C-1′(δ 173.9) and C-3′ (δ 171.1). In addition, like diterpene 1, the coupling constants between H-6 and H-5/H-7 (J ) 10.5, 11.0, 4.8 Hz) indicated the same relative conﬁguration for the substituent at C-6. The relative conﬁguration of the chiral centers C-8 and C-13 in 2 were assigned by NOE correlations between CH3-16 and CH3-17 (Figure 1), in agreement with a manoyl oxide diterpene skeleton.7,8 On the basis of the above evidence, compound 2 was characterized as 6R-malonyloxymanoyl oxide. Compound 3 was obtained as a white, amorphous solid with [R]D30 +57.0 and exhibited a molecular ion peak at [M+] m/z 448.6454 in the HRESIMS, corresponding to C27H44O5. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 was very similar to that of 2 (Table 1), suggesting that this compound also belongs to the manoyl oxide diterpene series. The main chemical shift differences observed in the 1H NMR spectrum were due to the additional signals at δ 3.84 Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Data for Compounds 1-3a 1 2 3 position δC δH δC δH δC δH 1 38.7 CH2 1.57, m 38.7 CH3 1.66, br d (12) 38.7 CH3 1.66, br d (12) 1.45, m 0.92, br t (12) 0.92, br t (12) 2 18.1 CH2 1.67, m 18.0 CH3 2.08, m 18.3 CH3 2.08, m 1.49, dt (16, 6) 1.43, m 1.43, m 3 43.3 CH2 1.16, dt 43.3 CH3 2.60, br d 43.7 CH3 2.6, br d (16) (12.5) (12.5) 1.37, dt (16) 1.03, m 1.03, m 4 33.6 C 33.2 C 33.0 C 5 58.8 CH 1.32, d (11.0) 58.6 CH 1.32, d (11) 58.6 CH 1.32, d (11) 6 70.8 CH 5.08, ddd 72.4 CH 5.08, ddd 72.4 CH 5.08, ddd (11.5, 11, 4.5) (10.5, 11, 4.8) (10, 11, 4.8) 7 49.8 CH2 2.11, dd 49.2 CH 2.20, dd 49.5 CH 2.20, dd (11.5, 12.0) (10.5, 10.8) (10, 10.8) 1.87, dd 1.46, dd 1.46, dd (4.5, 12.0) (4.8, 10.8) (4.8, 10.8) 8 74.0 C 74.3 C 73.9 C 9 54.1 CH 1.78, m 54.0 CH 1.44, br d 54.7 CH 1.44, br d (12.5) (12.5) 10 37.8 C 37.9 C 37.8 C 11 15.4 CH2 1.55, m 15.4 CH2 1.58, m 15.6 CH2 1.58, m 1.42, m 1.39, m 1.39, m 12 34.6 CH2 1.52, m 34.6 CH2 1.50, m 34.6 CH2 1.50, m 2.07, m 2.07, m 13 73.5 C 73,5 C 73.4 C 14 147.5 CH 5.86, dd 147.5 CH2 5.86, dd 147.4 CH2 5.86, dd (17.5, 11.0) (17.4, 10.7,) (10.7, 17.4) 15 110.4 CH2 4.83, dd 110.9 CH2 4.92, dd 110.3 CH2 5.14, dd (11.0, 1.50) (10.7, 1.6) (17.4, 1.6) 5.03, dd 5.14, dd 4.92, dd (17.0, 150) (17.4, 1.6) (10.7, 1.6) 16 29.1 CH3 1.23, s 29.3 CH3 1.21, s 29.4 CH3 1.21, s 17 26.9 CH3 1.39, s 25.9 CH3 1.37, s 27.0 CH3 1.37, s 18 36.0 CH3 0.86, s 36.2 CH3 0.84, s 36.1 CH3 0.84, s 19 21.8 CH3 0.87, s 22.7 CH3 0.86, s 22.1 CH3 0.86, s 20 16.4 CH3 1.00. s 16.5 CH3 0.99, s 16.6 CH3 0.99, s -OAc 170.0 C 21.9 CH3 2.00, s 1′ 173.9 C 166.9 C 2′ 43.6 CH2 3.31, s 42.5 CH2 3.20, s 3′ 171.1 C 165.6 C 1′′ 65.6 CH2 3.84, m 2′′ 36.1 CH2 1.47, m 3′′ 19.9 CH2 1.37, m 4′′ 13.8 CH3 0.93, t (7.0) a 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz for 13C NMR; CDCl3.

These data analyzed together with the signals at δ 65.6 (t), 36.1 (t), 19.9 (t), and 13.8 (q), observed in the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1), suggested the presence of a side-chain n-butyl in the structure of 3. This structural feature was further corroborated by 1H-1H COSY analysis, which indicated one spin system (C-1′′-C-2′′-C-3′′-C- 4′′), in agreement with a n-alkyl unity. The HMBC correlations of H-6 (5.08) to C-1′ (166.9), Η-1′′ (3.84) to C-3′ (165.6), and H-4′′ to C-2′′ revealed that the n-butyl unit is connected to the ester unit at C-6. This assumption was supported from the analysis of all spectroscopic data, including the NOESY, TOCSY, and HMBC spectra (Table S3, Supporting Information), which were consistent with the proposed structure, 6R-malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3). Diterpenoids 1-3 were examined for their antibiotic activity toward the bacteria S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, B. anthracis, M. luteus, M. smegmatis, and M. phlei (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, diterpene 2 exhibited moderate antibiotic activity, and 1 and 3 were inactive. It was also interesting to note that the malonyloxy function at C-6 seems to be an important feature for the antibacterial activity. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of 2 serves to corroborate the popular uses attributed for this plant to treat infectious respiratory diseases. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 °C. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X FT spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125.67 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High- resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Bruker spectrom- eter, using ESI+ mode. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich), or Sepha- dex LH-20 (Pharmacia). TLC was carried out using silica gel 60 (>230 mesh, Merck) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating. Preparative HPLC was performed on a preparative LC 4000 system (Waters) using C18 (250 mm × 21.20 mm, Phenomenex) columns. Plant Material. The aerial parts of Stemodia foliosa were collected in July 2000 in Va´rzea-PE, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Alda de Andrade Chiapeta. A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Botany, UFPE (UFP/19810). Extraction and Isolation. The powdered, sun-dried aerial parts (1.0 kg) of S. foliosa were extracted with EtOH (5 × 1 L). The EtOH extract was ﬁltered and evaporated in vacuo to obtain a dark green, gummy residue. Then, the EtOH extract was partitioned with n-BuOH-H2O (1:1, 3 × 1L). The n-BuOH extract (41.76 g) was partitioned with MeOH-H2O/hexane.

The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. These compounds were tested against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Compound 2 exhibited cytotoxicity for HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia) and SF-245 (human glioblastoma) cells. Pterogyne nitens Tul. (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae), popularly known as “ba´lsamo”, “yvira-ro´”, “cocal”, and “amendoinzeiro”, is a native tree common in South America. It is used as an ornamental due to its attractive ﬂowers and fruits.1,2 Medicinal uses of this species have not been reported frequently, although aqueous preparations from stem bark have been used by local Paraguayan populations in the therapy of ascariasis.3 Previous phytochemical studies with the leaves and fruits of P. nitens have demonstrated the presence of several guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity toward the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against CHO Aux B1 cells,4 and phenolic compounds with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical- scavenging activities.5-7 In our continuing search for new natural product-based anticancer agents from Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest plants, and their associated microorganisms,8,9 the ethanol extract of P. nitens was selected for further investigation due to its cytotoxic activity in the MTT assay. This extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning, yielding a bioactive n-butanol-soluble fraction with IC50 60 µg/mL against HL-60 (leukemia) cells. The n-butanol fraction was chromatographed using silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 followed by RP-18 to afford ﬁve guanidine alkaloids (1-5). Nitensidine D (1) was isolated as colorless oil and gave an alkaloid-positive test when sprayed with Dragendorff’s and Sak- aguchi’s reagents. Additionally, evidence for a guanidine alkaloidal type came from its molecular formula, which was established as C11H21N3 by HRESIMS. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) exhibited typical resonances for a terpenoid moiety, due to the presence of three vinyl methyl signals at δ 1.55, 1.61, and 1.63, two oleﬁnic protons at δ 5.07 and 5.17, and three methylenes at δ 1.97, 2.03, and 3.63. These data were consistent with the presence of a geranyl moiety. Additionally, a broad singlet at δ 8.85 was observed, integrating for four hydrogens, which was compatible with two amino groups of a guanidine structure. The geranyl moiety was conﬁrmed from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1), due to signals at δ 130.9 and 138.3 (two quaternary oleﬁnic carbons), δ 119.6 and 123.8 (two methine oleﬁnic carbons), δ 38.5, 38.9, and 25.9 (three methylene carbons), and δ 16.0, 17.5, and 25.4 (three methyls). The guanidine moiety was also evident from the signal at δ 157.6, characteristic of an imine functionality (Table 1). These observations and additional NMR experiments (DEPT 135, gHMQC, gCOSY, NOESY, and gHMBC) allowed us to establish a guanidine alkaloid structure for 1, with the same structural pattern for those alkaloids previously reported.4 The isolate 1 was fully characterized as shown, and its structure was in agreement with a tautomeric form (Figure 1). This proposal was supported by the 1H NMR data, in particular, due to the multiplicity observed for the signal displayed by the allyl hydrogen (H-1′) of the geranyl moiety. This signal appeared as a clear doublet at δ 3.63 (2H, J ) 6.0 Hz), which is compatible with a guanidine nucleus geranylated at N-1. The natural guanidines occurring in plants or animals show a variety of substitution patterns, with most of these including the 4 Dedicated to Dr. G. I.

However, the occurrence of the new guanidine-type alkaloid 1 can be explained by taking into account the imine tautomerism (Figure 1). Nitensidine E (2) was isolated as a colorless oil. The molecular formula was determined to be C11H19N3 by HRESIMS (m/z 194.2900 [M + H]+, calcd for C11H20N3, 194.2888), suggesting four degrees of unsaturation, with one additional unsaturation when compared with nitensidine D. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 (Table 1) indicated structural characteristics somewhat different from those of 1 and the other guanidines isolated previously from P. nitens.4 Considering that 2 possesses four unsaturations and showed positive Dragendorff’s and Sakaguchi’s tests, an alkaloid structure was deduced for this compound. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited the presence of a set of typical resonances at δ 5.52 (d, J ) 15.0 Hz), 5.81 (d, J ) 10.5 Hz), and 6.20 (dd, J ) 15.0, 10.5 Hz), characteristic of a sp2-conjugated system, which could be attributed to an E-diene unit based on the coupling constants shown for these hydrogens. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) showed resonances for three methine sp2 carbons at δ 135.4, 125.2, and 123.9 and for one quaternary sp2 carbon at δ 135.0. Additionally, both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed the presence of two vinyl methyl groups [δ 1.69 (18.0), 1.73 (25.5)] and a tertiary methyl group at δ 1.26 (27.6). These data revealed the presence of a C10 alkyl chain, which could be attributed to a monoterpene-type unit. The structural evidence from the spectroscopic data obtained allowed us to elucidate compound 2 with a guanidine alkaloid structure. Additionally, the mutually coupled methylenes [δ 1.61 (1H, m), 1.79 (1H, ddd, J ) 13.5, 4.0, 3.5 Hz), and 2.92 (1H, ddd, J ) 12.0, 14.0, 4 Hz), and δ 3.15 (1H, ddd, J ) 12.0, 4.0, 3.5 Hz)] would be compatible with a cyclic guanidine structure for 2. Indeed, this proposal was conﬁrmed from the gHMBC spectrum. The location of the methyl group C-10′ was assigned at C-3′ due to the observed gHMBC correlations between the methyl protons at H-10′ and C-2′, C-3′, and C-4′. Further, gHMBC cross-peaks between H-4′ and C-2′, C-10′, C-6′; H-1′ and C-2, C-3′; H-2′ and C-10′, C-4′; and H-6′ and C-8′, C-9′ completed the assignment of a cyclic guanidine-type alkaloid and its substit- uents. Also, a C10 alkyl chain composed of an E-diene unit was conﬁrmed through NOESY correlations observed for H-4′ and H-6′. The conformation adopted by this molecule was evaluated in a preliminary manner employing semiempirical calculations (Hamil- tonian as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G**), and a plausible conformation obtained for compound 2 with the methyl group at C-3′ in the -position is shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information. In Figure S2 (Supporting Information) we show a biogenetic proposal for the formation of the new guanidine derivatives 1 and 2. In addition to 1 and 2, three known compounds were isolated and identiﬁed as pterogynine10 (3), pterogynidine4 (4), and ga- legine11 (5). Compound 5 was ﬁrst isolated from Verbesina enceloiodes (Asteraceae) and later identiﬁed as a toxic and antidiabetic component from Galega ofﬁcinalis (Goat’s Rue).12 Galegine was a template for the design of metformin and other biguanide-type hypoglycemic drugs.13 The identiﬁcation of com- pounds 3-5 was based on 1H and 13C NMR and MS data analysis and by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory.4,10,11 Although a broad spectrum of biological activities has been described for guanidine alkaloids belonging to marine sources, few studies were reported from higher plants and of the potential anticancer activity of this class of natural products.14-16 All isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity, using a MTT assay, evidencing a key role of the prenyl substitution pattern in the level of activity. The cytotoxic activity of compounds 1-5 was evaluated in Vitro against HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma). Mean concentration inhibitory (IC50) values were determined using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol, with slight modiﬁcations, and the results are shown in Table 2. In human cells, nitensidine E (2) was the most active compound, showing activity for the different cell lines (Table 2). Therefore, guanidine alkaloids 2 may be useful as a prototype compound for the development of new antineoplastic drugs. Further work to evaluate the mechanism of action of the guanidine alkaloids characterized in this study is currently in progress. The structural features of nitensidines D (1) and E (2) appear less common than the guanidine alkaloids already reported from other higher plants. It is noteworthy that the majority of these alkaloids contain isoprenyl groups. Only one alkaloid having a similar geranyl side chain has been previously isolated from Fontainea pancheri (Euphorbiaceae).17 In some cases, the isopen- tenyl groups have undergone cyclization to produce hexahydroimi- dazo-pyrimidines, typical of Alchornea species (Euphorbiaceae).18,19 The structure of nitensidine E (2) constitutes the ﬁrst report of the Table 1. 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (125 MHz), and gHMBC Data for Compounds 1 and 2 in DMSO-d6 nitensidine D (1) nitensidine E (2) position δC, mult. δH J in Hz) gHMBC δC, mult. δH J in Hz) gHMBC 2 157.6, qC 1′ 154.1, qC 1′ 3 8.85, brs 7.98, brs 4 8.85, brs 7.68, brs 1′ 38.5, CH2 3.63, d (6.0) 2′ 35.1, CH2 2.92, ddd (12, 14, 4); 3.15, ddd (12, 4, 3.5) 2′ 119.6, CH 5.17, t (6.0) 1′, 4′, 10′ 31.9, CH2 1.61, m; 1.79, ddd (13.5, 4, 3.5) 4′, 10′ 3′ 138.3, qC 1′, 4′, 5′, 10′ 52.4, qC 1′, 4′, 5′, 10′ 4′ 38.9, CH2 1.97, m 5′, 10′ 135.4, CH 5.52, d (15.0) 2′, 10′ 5′ 25.9, CH2 2.03, m 4′ 125.2, CH 6.20, dd (15.0, 10.5) 6′ 123.8, CH 5.07, t (7.0) 4′, 5′, 8′, 9′ 123.9, CH 5.81, d (10.5) 4′, 8′, 9′ 7′ 130.9, qC 5′, 8′, 9′ 135.0, qC 5′, 8′, 9′ 8′ 17.5, CH3 1.55, s 6′, 9′ 18.0, CH3 1.69, s 6′, 9′ 9′ 25.4, CH3 1.63, s 8′, 9′ 25.5, CH3 1.73, s 6′, 8′ 10′ 16.0, CH3 1.61, s 2′, 4′ 27.6, CH3 1.26, s 2′, 4′ Figure 1.

To date, the isolation and characterization of prenylated guanidine alkaloids has been reported only within a limited number of plant genera.20-23 Furthermore, terpenoid-like alkaloids may have some taxonomic signiﬁcance for Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae, since their occurrence is most common among these taxa. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT 90°, and DEPT 135°) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using DMSO-d6 as an internal standard. Positive-ion high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an HRMS ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics). IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 FT- IR spectrometer using KBr disks. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). Column chromatography was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was per- formed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 °C, as well as by using Dragendorff’s and Sakaguchi’s reagents. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm × 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden. Plant Material. Pterogyne nitens leaves were collected at the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil). Extraction and Isolation. The shade-dried leaves (2.8 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with hexane (2.0 L × 5, at room temperature, for ﬁve weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macera- tion with ethanol (4.0 L × 5) at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (<40 °C) to yield 12.7 g of a syrup. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH-H2O (4:1) (3.5 L) and partitioned successively with EtOAc (5.0 L × 3) and n-butanol (5.0 L × 3). After removal of the solvent 3.7 and 5.9 g of extract were afforded, respectively. The n-butanol residue was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sephadex LH-20 (2.5 g) in methanol to afford nine fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC visualized with Sakaguchi’s24 and Dragendorff’s reagents, to yield an alkaloidal fraction (587 mg). Separation of this fraction on reversed-phase silica gel column chromatography (RP-18) by elution with increasing amounts of MeCN in H2O afforded eight fractions (ALK-1-ALK- 8) and guanidine 5 (18 mg). Fraction ALK-3 (121 mg) was subjected to repeated column chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluted with CHCl3-MeOH mixtures (ranging from 0 to 35% MeOH), to furnish the isoprenylated alkaloids 3 (27 mg) and 4 (12 mg). Fraction ALK-7 (62 mg) was further puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeCN-H2O-AcOH (16:84:0.01), UV detection at 235 nm; ﬂow rate 13 mL/min], affording the new geranylated alkaloids 1 (22 mg) and 2 (11 mg). Nitensidine D (1): colorless oil; IR (KBr) νmax 1652, 1618, 1012, 845 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMS m/z 196.3052 [M + H]+ (calcd for C11H22N3, 196.3063). Nitensidine E (2): colorless oil; [R]25D +140.0 (c 0.01, MeOH); IR (KBr) νmax 1649, 1618, 1093, 839 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1; HRESIMS m/z 194.2900 [M + H]+ (calcd for C11H20N3, 194.2888). Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the guanidine alkaloids 1-5 was tested against four tumor cell lines: HL-60 (human leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 × 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 µL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 µg/mL) dissolved in DMSO (5%) were added to each well and incubated for three days. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 µg/mL) was used as positive control. Growth of tumor cells was quantiﬁed by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan product. At the end of 72 h incubation, the medium in each well was replaced by fresh medium (200 µL) containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product of MTT reduction was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (Spectra Count, Packard, Ontario, Canada). Drug effect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of control absorbance of reduced dye at 590 nm. The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Institutive Software for Science, San Diego).25 Acknowledgment.

Additionally, bioactivity-directed fractionation on a bioactive hexane extract of the leaves from this species led to the isolation of the known clerodane diterpenes rel-6-hydroxyzuelanin-2-benzoate and rel-2R- hydroxyzuelanin-6-benzoate (3 and 4) as a mixture and 2-hydroxyzuelanin-6-cinnamate (5). The structures of the new clerodanes 1 and 2 were established on the basis of their 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data, and the new compound 1 and the known substance 5 had their absolute conﬁgurations determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of several of the compounds isolated was evaluated against a small panel of human tumor cell lines. The plant genus Casearia (Salicaceae sensu lato) contains about 180 species distributed in the tropics1 and is known as a rich source of clerodane-type diterpenes.2-9 This genus is widely distributed in Brazil, where Casearia sylVestris is the most frequent species, occurring from the Amazon basin throughout the Cerrado to the Atlantic forest and the south of Brazil.10 In a continuing investigation on bioactive clerodane diterpenes from Casearia species, phytochemical studies were carried out for the ﬁrst time on Casearia obliqua Spreng, a tree that grows commonly in the southern part of Brazil, where it is popularly known as “guac¸atonga-vermelha”.11 Antimalarial, cytotoxic, im- munomodulatory, and trypanocidal effects have been shown by several clerodane diterpenoids from plants of the genus Casearia.2-9 Results and Discussion A bioactive ethanol extract from the twigs of C. obliqua was partitioned with hexane, Et2O, EtOAc, and H2O. The cytotoxic Et2O fraction was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20, followed by preparative RP-HPLC on a C18 column, affording the new clerodane diterpenes caseobliquin A (1) and caseobliquin B (2). The bioactive hexane extract from leaves of C. obliqua was chromatographed on silica gel, followed by preparative RP-HPLC on a C18 column, yielding three known compounds, rel-6-hydroxyzuelanin-2- benzoate (3) and rel-2R-hydroxyzuelanin-6-benzoate (4) (which were obtained as a mixture) and 2-hydroxyzuelanin-6-cinnamate (5). The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were deduced on the basis of their spectroscopic data (UV, IR, CD, 1D and 2D NMR, MS) and by comparison with values reported in the literature. The cytotoxic activity of several of the diterpenes isolated was evaluated against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Caseobliquin A (1) was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid and showed a cationized ion at m/z 619.2513 [M + Na]+ (calcd 619.2513), corresponding to a molecular formula of C33H40O10, determined by HRTOFESIMS. The IR spectrum showed the presence of hydroxy group (3436 cm-1) and carbonyl ester (1749, 1735, 1717 cm-1) functionalities. The 13C and DEPT NMR data (Table 2) revealed 33 signals attributable to nine quaternary carbons (including four carbonyls), 14 methines, four methylenes, and six methyls. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of two methyl groups at δ 0.97 (d, J ) 7.0 Hz, H-17) and 0.92 (s, H-20), an oxymethine proton at δ 5.54 (m, H-2), two acetal-acyloxy methine protons at δ 6.39 (t, J ) 1.5 Hz, H-18) and 6.67 (s, H-19), and a trisubstituted oleﬁnic proton at δ 5.95 (sl, H-3), consistent with a casearin clerodane skeleton as isolated from Casearia species.10,12-14 The six-carbon diene side chain (C-11-C-16) indicated the presence of a terminal unsaturated methylene group, supported by the resonances at δ 5.09 (d, J ) 17.5 Hz, H-15) and * Corresponding author.

The other methine proton signal was observed as a multiplet at δ 5.54 (H- 12). This side chain was also conﬁrmed by gCOSY correlations of H-11 to H-12 and H-14 to H-15. The gHMBC spectrum exhibited correlations of H-11 to C-9, C-10, C-12, and C-13; H-14 to C-12 and C-16; and H-15 to C-13, revealing that this side chain is located at the C-9 position. The conﬁguration of the C-12,13 double bond was found to be E on the basis of the NOESY correlations between H-12 and H-14 (Figure 1). The p-hydroxybenzoate group was deduced from the resonances at δ 6.83 (2H, d, J ) 9.0 Hz, H-3′ and H-7′) and 7.97 (2H, d, J ) 9.0 Hz, H-4′ and H-6′). The gHMBC spectrum showed a correlation of the oxymethine proton, H-6, to the carbonyl carbon (δ 167.1, C-1′) of the p-hydroxybenzoate group, which indicated that the p-hydroxybenzoate is located at C-6 (δ 76.5). The H-18 (δ 6.39) and H-19 (δ 6.67) protons were correlated to carbonyl groups (δ 171.8 and 171.1), respectively, establishing these as sites of acetylation. By elimination, the third acetate group (δ 172.5 and 21.0) could be located at C-2. On comparing compound 1 with other clerodane diterpenoids, this compound showed differences in the conﬁgurations of the carbons C-5, C-6, C-8, C-9, C-10, and C-18, as indicated by chemical shift data for compound 1 in relation to literature values.15 The relative conﬁguration of all eight chiral centers was assigned on the basis of their coupling constants and by NOESY correlations (Table 1 and Figure 2). A 1,3-diaxial NOESY correlation was observed for H-6 and H-8, which indicated that the C-8 methyl group (C-17) is in an equatorial orientation. The trans conﬁguration between the C-17 and C-20 methyl groups was proposed because of the chemical shift at δ 25.3 for C-20, which also supported a Table 1. 1H NMR Spectroscopic Data (500 MHz, CD3OD) for Compounds 1 and 2 caseobliquin A (1) caseobliquin B (2) caseobliquin A (1) caseobliquin B (2) position δH (J in Hz) δH (J in Hz) position δH (J in Hz) δH (J in Hz) 1 1.84 m 1.99 m 17 0.97 d (7.0) 0.97 d (7.0) 1.89 m 2.09 m 2 5.54 m 4.41 m 18 6.39 t (1.5) 6.49 t (1.5) 3 5.95 brs 6.06 d (4.0) 19 6.67 s 6.67 s 4 20 0.92 s 0.91 s 5 1′ 6 5.34 dd (4.5, 12.0) 5,11 dd (4.5, 12.0) 2′ 6.48 d (16.0) 7 1.78 m 1.78 m 3′ 6.83 d (9.0) 7.80 d (16.0) 1.89 m 1.93 m 8 2.04 m 4′ 7.97 d (9.0) 9 5′ 7.63 m 10 2.58 dd (3.0, 14.0) 2.57 dd (3.5, 14.4) 6′ 7.97 d (9.0) 7.40 m 11 1.80 m 2.29 dd (8.0, 17.0) 2.33 dd (8.8, 17.5) 7′ 6.83 d (9.0) 7.40 m 12 5.54 m 5.58 m 8′ 7.40 m 13 9′ 7.63 m 14 6.43 dd (17.5, 11.0) 6.41 dd (10.5, 17.5) O2CCH3-2 2.07 s 1.90 s 15 4.93 d (11.0) 4.92 d (10.5) O2CCH3-18 2.03 s 2.05 s 5.09 d (17.5) 5.10 d (17.5) 1.95 s 1.94 s 16 1.67 s 1.67 s O2CCH3-19 Table 2. 13C NMR Spectroscopic Data (125 MHz, δC, mult.) for Compounds 1-4 position 1a 1b 2b 3a 4a 1 29.6 27.2, CH2 30.2 37.4, CH2 29.4, CH2 2 70.5 72.2, CH 64.4 67.1, CH 63.8, CH 3 125.3 126.5, CH 128.1 121.7, CH 126.5, CH 4 143.1 144.5, qC 142.5 145.6, qC 142.3, qC 5 52.6 53.3, qC 57.8 53.7, qC 51.9, qC 6 75.0 76.5, CH 75.5 72.8, CH 74.7, CH 7 34.9 34.5, CH2 34.1 27.0, CH2 33.1, CH2 8 38.1 37.3, CH 37.6 37.1, CH 36.4, CH 9 39.2 39.5, qC 37.6 37.6, qC 37.7, qC 10 44.9 43.3, CH 38.0 36.7, CH 36.1, CH 11 31.0 31.1, CH2 31.0 30.4, CH2 30.4, CH2 12 128.8 130.4, CH 130.8 128.9, CH 129.0, CH 13 137.0 136.9, CH 136.3 135.7, qC 135.7, qC 14 141.0 142.7, CH 142.5 141.2, CH 141.2, CH 15 111.3 111.1, CH2 111.0 111.0, CH2 111.0, CH2 16 13.8 12.0, CH3 12.2 11.9, CH3 11.9, CH3 17 15.4 15.8, CH3 15.7 15.5, CH3 15.4, CH3 18 94.9 96.0, CH 94.0 95.6, CH 95.4, CH 19 97.2 98.4, CH 98.2 97.0, CH 97.7, CH 20 24.8 25.3, CH3 25.4 25.0, CH3 25.0, CH3 1′ 165.1 167.1, qC 167.7 165.8, qC 166.0, qC 2′ 121.9 121.8, qC 118.2 130.5, qC 130.5, qC 3′ 115.6 116.3, CH 147.1 129.6, CH 129.8, CH 4′ 132.3 133.1, CH 135.0 128.4, CH 128.6, CH 5′ 160.0 163.9, qC 129.1 133.1, CH 133.4, CH 6′ 132.3 133.1, CH 130.0 128.4, CH 128.6, CH 7′ 115.6 116.3, CH 130.5 129.6, CH 129.8, CH 8′ 130.0 9′ 129.1 O2CCH3-2 170.8 172.5, qC 179.0 21.0 21.0, CH3 23.1 O2CCH3-18 170.0 171.8, qC 171.9 170.0, qC 170.1, qC 21.0 20.9, CH3 21.0 21.2, CH3 21.1, CH3 O2CCH3-19 169.8 171.1, qC 171.1 169.4, qC 169.6, qC 21.9 21.9, CH3 21.8 21.5, CH3 21.7, CH3 a CDCl3. b CD3OD; multiplicities were determined by analyses of the DEPT 90° and 135°.

Selected NOE enhancements observed for 1. 1848 Journal of Natural Products, 2009, Vol. 72, No. 10 Vieira Ju´nior et al. cis-A/B ring junction.10,15,17 The J values of 3.0 and 14.0 Hz for the coupling of H-10 to H-1 protons revealed that H-10 is in an axial position, while the NOESY correlations between H-2/H-10 showed that H-2 is -oriented. The chemical shift at δC 70.5 in CDCl3 for the C-2 oxymethine carbon was consistent with the C-2 substituent having an R-orientation, as reported for related compounds.1,18 The acetal proton, H-19, was also assigned with a -orientation on the basis of the NOESY correlation of H-19 to H-10, and to the other acetal proton, H-18, an R-orientation was assigned because of the NOE enhancement observed for H-18 with the protons H-4′/H-6′ from the p-hydroxybenzoate moiety (δ 7.97). This could occur only if H-18 is on the opposite face of the diacetal furan ring in relation to H-19 (Figure 1).16 X-ray crystallographic data were used earlier to assign the absolute conﬁguration for a series of clerodane diterpenes similar to 1.15 The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, in which a positive Cotton effect was exhibited at 241 nm. The C-9 carbon of the clerodane diterpenes occurs with a R orientation when a negative Cotton curve is evident,12 so 1 was assigned with an S orientation at C-9. Following this argument, it was possible to determine the complete absolute conﬁguration of compound 1, as follows: 2R, 5R, 6R, 8S, 9S, 10R, 18S, 19S. This new compound, named caseobliquin A, is a diastereoisomer of casearborin E.15 Caseobliquin B (2) was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid, with a molecular formula of C35H41O9 as determined by HRTOFES- IMS (observed m/z 629.2747 [M + Na]+). The complete 1H and 13C NMR data for 2 are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The entire data set was similar to that for 1 except for the modiﬁcation from the substituent at C-6, with that in 1 a p-hydroxybenzoate moiety and that for 2 a cinnamoyl moiety. gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC NMR experiments performed supported the same connectivities for 2 as in 1. The cinnamoyl group was deduced from the resonances at δ 6.48 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-2′), 7.80 (1H, d, J ) 16.0 Hz, H-3′), 7.40 (3H, m, H-6′, H-7′ and H-8′), and 7.63 (2H, m, H-5′ and H-9′). The gHMBC spectrum showed a correlation of the oxymethine proton, H-19 (δ 6.67), linked to the acetate carbonyl at δ 171.1. The ester groups were located by comparison with appropriate values reported in the literature,16 the cinnamoyl was placed at C-6 (δ 75.5), and the acetate groups were placed at carbons C-2 (δ 64.4) and C-18 (δ 94.0). These assignments were corroborated by NOE enhancements between H-12 and the methyl group (δ 1.90) of the acetate moiety at position 2 and between H-15 and the methyl group (δ 2.05) of the acetate moiety at position 18 (Figure 2). Khan et al.16 used NOESY data to assign the relative conﬁgu- ration for a series of clerodane diterpenoids that have a two- dimensional structure identical to that of 2, differing only in the stereochemistry of C-2. The chemical shift at δ 64.4 for the C-2 oxymethine carbon was consistent with the C-2 substituent having a -orientation, as reported for related compounds,9,17 whereas from the literature this value is δ 70.2 (R-orientation).16 On the basis of the evidence above, compound 2 could be determined to have the relative conﬁguration 2S, 5R, 6R, 8S, 9S, 10R, 18S, 19S. This is a diastereoisomer of rel-2R-acetoxyzuelanin-6-cinnamate16 and has been named caseobliquin B. The three known clerodane diterpenes (3-5) were identiﬁed on the basis of their spectroscopy data (UV, IR, and NMR) and comparison with appropriate values reported in the literature. The 13C NMR data of compounds 3 and 4 and the absolute conﬁguration of 5 are included in this paper, in order to complement the lack of this information in previous reports of these compounds.16,19 Four compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity, using the MTT assay, corroborating the well-established cytotoxicity of this compound class. The cytotoxic activities of compound 1, a mixture 3 and 4, and 5 were evaluated in vitro against HL-60 (human myeloblastic leukemia), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma), and SF-295 (human glioblas- toma) cells. Inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined, and the results are shown in Table 3. The mixture of compounds 3 and 4 showed signiﬁcant cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC50 values ranging from 0.13 to 1.0 µM, close to data obtained for the positive control, doxorubicin (Table 3). Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 LC polarimeter. UV spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 A spectrometer. The circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a JASCO PU-2089 HPLC system conﬁgurated with UV-vis (MD-2010) and circular dichroism (CD-2095) detectors. IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet Impact 400 spectrometer using KBr disks. The 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT 90, NOESY, and DEPT 135) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and NOESY) NMR experi- ments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) with a pulse ﬁeld gradient.

Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 with a UV-vis detector (model 330) using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm), in order to develop the reversed-phase conditions, which were scaled up for preparative work. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C18 (250 mm × 21.2 mm, 10 µm) preparative column. Column chromatography was performed over silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck) or on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 °C. Plant Material. Casearia obliqua leaves and twigs were collected in May 2007 at Campinas municipality, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. The plant material was identiﬁed by one of the authors (R.B.T.). A voucher specimen (IAC46529) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Agro- noˆmico de Campinas (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil). Recent studies on the phylogeny of the Flacourtiaceae, based on plastid rbcL DNA sequences, have shown that the family is polyphyletic and recognized by two major clades, one with close afﬁnities to the Salicaceae and the other with the Achariaceae. Among those genera of Flacourtiaceae now assigned to Salicaceae sensu lato is the genus Casearia.20 Extraction and Isolation. The twigs (534.0 g) of C. obliqua were extracted exhaustively by maceration with hexane, ethanol, and water (3.0 L × 3), successively, at room temperature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (e40 °C) to yield 9.3 g of a crude extract. This ethanol extract was then diluted with MeOH-H2O (3:1) and partitioned successively with hexane (1.0 L × 3), Et2O (1.0 L × 3), and EtOAc (1.0 L × 3). After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 4.0 g of residue, respectively. Part of the cytotoxic Et2O fraction (1.0 g) was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 (78.0 × 3.0 cm), eluted with methanol, to afford 95 fractions, which were combined on the basis of TLC visualized with anisaldehyde-H2SO4. Cytotoxic fraction 50 (54.0 mg) was submitted to preparative RP-HPLC on a C18 column (Phenomenex Luna 250 mm × 21.2 mm, 10 µm), eluted with MeOH-H2O-AcOH (85:15:0.01) at a ﬂow rate of 15 mL/min and UV detection at 254 nm, affording the clerodane diterpenes 1 (6.0 mg) and 2 (1.3 mg). The leaves (94.7 g) of C. obliqua were extracted exhaustively by maceration successively with hexane, ethanol, and water (3.0 L × 3) at room temperature. The hexane extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (e40 °C) to yield 1.5 g of a crude extract. This extract exhibited cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines and was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (15.0 × 4.5 cm), eluted in a gradient step mode from hexane to EtOAc, yielding 15 fractions. Cytotoxic fraction 8 (114.0 mg) was subjected to preparative RP-HPLC on a C18 column, eluted with MeOH-H2O (78:22) at a ﬂow rate 14 mL/min and UV detection at 254 nm, affording the clerodane diterpenes 5 (6.2 mg) and a mixture of 3 and 4 (1.7:1.0; 10.0 mg).

Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes (1, 3 and 4, 5) was tested against four tumor cell lines: SF-295 (human glioblastoma), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), HL-60 (human leukemia), and MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma). Cells were main- tained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin, at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 × 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 µL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 µg/ mL) dissolved in DMSO were added to each well. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 µg/mL) was used as positive control. The proliferation of tumor cells was quantiﬁed by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan product. At the end of 69 h incubation, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL of MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Graphpad program (Institutive Software for Science, San Diego, CA).21 Acknowledgment.

Box 4009, 01061-970, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil ReceiVed October 12, 2009 Two unusual pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2), were isolated from the leaves of Senna multijuga, together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin. The structures of the new alkaloids were established on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, in comparison with the standard compound physostigmine. Senna multijuga (Rich.) Irwin et Barneby (syn. Cassia multijuga Rich.) (Fabaceae) is a medium-size evergreen tree distributed widely in several Brazilian regions and other biomes from Africa.1 Several chemical studies of seeds, leaves, and roots have shown the occurrence of ﬂavonoids,2 anthraquinones,3,4 polysaccharides,5 and chromones.6 In Brazil, this species is popularly known as “pau- cigarra”, “caquera”, “topeiuia”, “aleluia”, and “canafı´stula” and is used as an ornamental plant in several regions of the country due to its attractive yellow ﬂowers.1,7 Although some species of the Senna (Cassia) genus have been reported to be an important source of phenolic compounds with diverse biological and pharmacological properties,8 only the seeds of S. multijuga are used for the treatment of ophthalmic and skin infections.2 However, no phytochemical study on the isolation of the secondary metabolites of this species has been conducted previously. As part of our ongoing research on Atlantic Forest plant species,9 we selected S. multijuga for study. From an ethanolic extract of the leaves were isolated two new pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′- multijuguinone (2), together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin.10 The occurrence of 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine alkaloids is unusual, and only one report has been described in the literature.11 Herein, we present the isolation, structure elucidation, and acetyl- cholinesterase-inhibitory properties of 1 and 2 by bioautography and microplate screening assays. The ﬁrst Dragendorff-positive compound, 7′-multijuguinone (1), was isolated as a white solid, mp 103-105 °C. The molecular weight of 1 was measured by HRESITOFMS, and the molecular formula was established as C18H29NO2, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5. The observed pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ was calculated for C18H30NO2, 292.2271. The UV spectrum, with absorption maxima at 222 and 287 nm, suggested the presence of a ketone and substituted aromatic moiety chro- mophores, respectively. IR absorption bands were assigned to hydroxy (3401 cm-1), carbonyl (1701 cm-1), and pyridine ring (1578, 1498, and 1464 cm-1) functional groups. Examination of the 1H, 13C, and DEPT NMR spectra recorded in CDCl3 (Table 1) showed the presence of a 2,3,6-trisubstituted pyridine ring [δ 7.00 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4), 6.84 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5); δ 145.3 (C-2), 148.8 (C-3), 122.7 (C-4), 120.8 (C-5), and 152.9 (C-6)], two methyl groups at δ 0.88 (t, H-12′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 13.9) and 2.47 (s, H-7, δC 18.5), and 10 methylenes at δ 2.67 (t, H-1′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 37.0), 1.64 (qt, H-2′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 30.2), 1.30 (m, H-3′, H-4′, and H-11′, δC 29.1, 29.0, and 22.4), 1.55 (qt, H-5′ and H-9′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 23.8 and 23.5), 2.36 (t, H-6′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.7), 2.37 (t, H-8′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.8), and 1.27 (m, H-10′, δC 31.4) and suggested the presence of a long linear side chain in the structure of 1. Furthermore, the side chain from C-1′ to C-12′ was deduced as being attached at C-6 of the pyridine nucleus by a gHMBC NMR experiment. Three-bond correlations were observed from H-5 to C-1′, H-1′ to C-5, and H-2′ to C-6 (Figure 1), supporting a 2-methyl- 3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine substitution pattern. The 7′-oxodode- cyl unit linked at C-6 is different from the long-chain pattern observed for other piperidine and pyridine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species. The position of the 7′-oxo group on the straight side chain was also deﬁned by gHMBC data analysis, for which the main correlations are represented in Figure 1. Furthermore, in a TOCSY experiment irradiation of H-1′ and H-12′ showed ⊥Dedicated to the late Dr. John W. Daly of NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, and the late Dr. Richard E.

J. Nat. Prod. 2010, 73, 482–484 482 10.1021/np900644x 2010 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 12/14/2009 correlations with H-2′-H-6′ and H-8′-H-12′, respectively. HO- MODEC experiments were carried out decoupling H-2′ (δ 1.64), which enabled the loss of multiplicity from the neighboring H-1′ and H-3′ (overlapped with H-4′). When H-5′ was decoupled, loss of multiplicity was observed for H-6′ and H-4′ (overlapped with H-3′), supporting the same chemical shift for H-3′ and H-4′. The same pattern was observed with H-10′ and H-11′ when H-9′ and H-12′ were decoupled. The interpretation of these gHMBC sequence cross-peaks led to the establishment of the oxo function at the C-7′ position in the side chain. Furthermore, the gHMBC correlations of H-5 with C-3 (3J) and C-1′ (3J), together with that from H-7 to C-2 (2J) and C-3 (3J), allowed the hydroxy group to be located at C-3, which was consistent with a previous study on bioactive piperidine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species, with features similar to 1.9 Additionally, the gHMBC (1H-15N) spectrum showed a correlation between the nitrogen signal at δ 308.8 and signals at δ 2.67 (H-1′), 6.84 (H-5), and 2.47 (H-7). All this evidence agreed with the hydroxy group being located at C-3 and conﬁrmed the assumption made on the substitution pattern in pyridine alkaloid 1, which must be 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxododecyl) pyridine, similar to those found for piperidine alkaloids from other Senna (Cassia) species, except for the ketone group position in the side chain. These results suggested that the hydroxy group of this pyridine alkaloid is at C-3, which is not in agreement with those previously reported for a similar pyridine alkaloid from this species, with no hydroxy group being located at C-5.5 Compound 2 was obtained as a white solid, mp 71-73 °C, and gave a positive test with Dragendorff reagent. This compound showed spectroscopic features very similar to those of 1. The HRESITOFMS for 2 exhibited a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220), appropriate for the molecular formula C18H29NO3, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5 and being 16 mass units more than that of 1. The IR spectrum revealed the carbonyl absorption band at 1703 cm-1, a pyridine ring at 1584, 1489, and 1464 cm-1, and a hydroxy group band at 3392 cm-1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 showed signals very close to those of 1 (Table 1), as in the 1H NMR spectrum, which demonstrates the presence of a substituted pyridine ring system at δ 7.02 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4) and 6.85 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5). Additionally, the methyl hydrogens of CH3-7 at δ 2.48, analyzed together with 13C NMR data, conﬁrmed that the pyridine moiety is similar to that of 1. However, differences were evident between these compounds since the methyl group (CH3-12′) located in the side chain of 1 was replaced with a hydroxy methylene group in 2 at δ 3.67 (2H, t, J ) 6.5, H-12′, δC 62.5). These data, supported by the 13C NMR, DEPT, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY, and HOMODEC spectra, were in agreement with a pyridine system bearing one hydroxy group, one methyl, and one long-chain substituent. According to these data, the structure of 2 was determined as 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxo-12′-hydroxy- dodecyl)pyridine. All compounds isolated were screened for their AChE inhibitory activity, using bioautography and microplate tests, and the results are shown in Table 2. The preliminary TLC assay suggested moderate activity for compounds 1 and 2, which showed the minimum amounts of these alkaloids required for AChE inhibition of 0.75 and 0.18 µg, respectively, when compared with physostigmine (positive control, 0.05 µg). Rutin proved to be inactive, since the minimum amount required to show activity was over 100 µg. In addition, the microplate test conﬁrmed activity of the compounds 1 and 2, which exhibited weak AChE inhibition of 13% and 30% at 350 mM. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were recorded on a digital Microquimica MQAPF-302 apparatus and are uncorrected. UV data were acquired using an Amersham Ultrospec 2100 pro UV/ vis spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS10 FT- IR spectrometer coupled with an ATR accessory (the samples were pressed against a crystal of Ge). The 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT, NOESY, TOCSY, and HOMODEC) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, gH- MBC, and 1H-15N gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) at 30 °C and referenced using TMS (δTMS ) 0.00) as internal standard or residual solvent resonances of CDCl3 at δ 7.26 and 77.0 ppm, respectively, for 1H and 13C. High-resolution mass spectra with electrospray ionization were measured on an ultrOTOFQ (Bruker Daltonics) operating in positive mode. MeOH-H2O (4:1) was used as solvent system. TLC was performed on silica gel F254 plates (0.20 mm, Fluka), and spots were visualized under UV light (254 and 366 nm) and spraying with Dragendorff’s reagent or anisaldehyde-H2SO4, followed by charring for 5 min. Preparative TLC was carried out with Analtech 500 µm thick silica gel GF plates (20 × 20 cm, Uniplate) and visualized under UV light at 366 nm. Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) ProStar system equipped with a ternary pump model 340, a photodiode array detector model 330, and an autosampler model 410, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.52 software. Preparative HPLC separation was performed on a Varian PrepStar system equipped with a UV-vis detector model 320 and a binary pump model SD-1 manual injector, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.51 software. The columns used were a Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 4.60 mm, 5 µm) and a preparative Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 21.20 mm, 10 µm) protected by corresponding guard columns. All solvents used in the experimental procedures were distilled previously. For chromatographic analysis, HPLC-grade solvents (J. T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico) were employed.

Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 3 483 The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation, yielding a thick syrup (210 g). The crude ethanol extract (100 g) was further reconstituted in MeOH-H2O (4:1), ﬁltered, and then partitioned with n-hexane (250 mL × 5), CH2Cl2 (250 mL × 4), EtOAc (250 mL × 4), and n-BuOH (250 mL × 2), successively. All phases were concentrated under reduced pressure. The CH2Cl2 fraction (15.9 g) was dissolved in 500 mL of 5% HCl aqueous solution (ca. pH 2), ﬁltered, and partitioned with EtOAc (50 mL × 3) to remove nonbasic components. Then, NH4OH (30%) was added to the aqueous phase until ca. pH 8.5 and partitioned with CH2Cl2 (50 mL × 5). The latter organic layer was washed with H2O (100 mL × 3) and concentrated in order to give a neutral alkaloidal fraction (457 mg), which was puriﬁed by using preparative TLC with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc (1.5: 2.0:6.5) as developing solvent (×2). The bands with Rf values of 0.50 and 0.18 were scraped and eluted with MeOH, affording pure compounds 1 (49.1 mg) and 2 (60.5 mg). Fraction EtOAc (2.20 g) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (5:95 to 100:0) to yield six fractions (EtOAc-F1 to EtOAc- F6). Fractions EtOAc-F2 and EtOAc-F3 (527 mg) were further puriﬁed by preparative HPLC on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (40:60, ﬂow rate 19 mL/min, UV 254 nm), affording compound 3 (tR 17.4 min, 42.0 mg). Bioautographic Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of pure compounds was determined using a TLC bioautographic assay as previously described.12 The TLC layers were spotted with 1 and 2 in a range from 0.09 to 6.00 µg developed with n-hexane-EtOAc (1:4, v/v) and subsequently dried. The plates were then sprayed with the enzyme solution (6.66 U/mL), thoroughly dried, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min (moist atmosphere). Enzyme activity was detected by spraying with a solution consisting of 0.25% of 1-naphthyl acetate in EtOH plus 0.25% aqueous solution of Fast Blue B salt. Potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appeared as clear zones on a purple- colored background. Electric eel AChE type V (product no. C 2888, 1000 U) and the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Microplate Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of compounds 1-3 was evaluated using the modiﬁed methods of Ellman et al. and Rhee et al. in a 96-well microplate, as previously described.13 Using this method, the enzyme hydrolyzes the substrate acetylthiocholine, resulting in the production of thiocholine, which reacts with 5,5′-dithiobis(2- nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate-5-mercaptothio- choline and 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate and can be detected at 405 nm. To the 96-well plates were added 25 µL of an aqueous solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (15 mM), 125 µL of DTNB (3 mM) in buffer C, 50 µL of buffer B, and 25 µL of sample diluted in buffer A, to give a range of concentrations from 0.78 to 100 µg/mL. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s three times. Furthermore, 25 µL of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme was added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min two times. Any increase in absorbance due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the rate of the reaction before the addition of the enzyme from the rate of the enzyme reaction. The percentage of inhibition was calculated in comparison to a blank (10% MeOH in buffer A), and a positive control of physostigmine was used in the same range of concentrations. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8); buffer B, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction; buffer C, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.10 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2·6H2O. All of the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 7′-Multijuguinone (1): white solid; mp 103-105 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR νmax 3401, 2919, 2849, 1701, 1578, 1498, 1464, 1285, 1164, 1130, 832, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRESITOFMS m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO2, 292.2271); TLC Rf 0.50 (1.5:2.0:6.5 n-hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc). 12′-Hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2): white solid; mp 71-73 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR (ﬁlm) νmax 3392, 2931, 2851, 1703, 1584, 1489, 1464, 1290, 1248, 1160, 1128, 1048, 827, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRES- ITOFMS m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220); TLC Rf 0.18 (1.5:2:6.5 n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc).

The structure of compound 1 was elucidated by interpretation of spectral data, including ES-MS. Compound 1 showed antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaero- spermum. Chemical studies carried out on Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of essential oils, pyrones, lignoids, and unsaturated amides.1 Some of these compounds have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal properties.2 In the course of our ongoing search for bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora,3 we have investigated the CH2Cl2 extract from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Piperaceae) employ- ing two preliminary bioassays: anticancer activity based on growth evaluation of genetically engineered mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae4,5 and antifungal effect utilizing direct bioautography with the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum.6 The extract exhibited moderate and nonselective activity on all the mutant strains tested, suggesting the presence of antifungal agents rather than potential anticancer agents. In fact, it did show activity against the fungus C. sphaerosper- mum (MIC 1096 µg). Subsequent bioactive-guided fractionation led to the isolation of a new amide N-[7- (3′,4′-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadienoyl]pyr- rolidine (1) and the known amides N-[5-(3′,4′-methyl- enedioxyphenyl)-2(E)-pentadienoyl]pyrrolidine and N-[2- (3′,4′-methylenedioxy, 6-methoxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]- pyrrolidine. Of these, the amide 1 exhibited antifungal activity. Compound 1 has a molecular formula of C18H21NO3 as determined by electrospray mass spectral analysis (ES-MS) and 13C NMR data. The UV spectrum dis- played an absorption at 262 nm, indicating the presence of a conjugated dienamide system. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylene- dioxyphenyl group) cm-1. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1 revealed signals for 3′,4′-methylenedioxyphenyl protons (δ 5.86) and signals related to four olefinic protons. Two of the olefinic protons showed signals at δ 5.77 (1H, d, J ) 11.4 Hz) and 6.37 (1H, t, J ) 11.4 Hz) assigned to protons H-2 and H-3, respectively, corroborating the R,â-unsaturated carbonyl system. Signals at δ 7.30 (dd, J ) 11.4 Hz) and 5.94 (dd, J ) 11.4, 7.0 Hz) were assigned to the protons of the second double bond conjugated to the first one. Most of the amides isolated from Piper species possess the (E,E) configuration in the double bonds of the side chain; however, this compound differed from the normal skeleton judging by the coupling constant observed for protons H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5. In compounds with (E) configuration, the coupling constants are normally J2,3 ) 15.0 Hz and J4,5 ) 15.0 Hz,7,8 while in the case of amide 1, these values were observed at J2,3 ) 11.4 Hz and J4,5 ) 11.4 Hz, indicating that the two double bonds possess the (Z,Z) configuration. The assignments of these protons were established by analysis of the 1H- 1H COSY spectrum (Figure 1) and also by irradiation of the H-2, which caused the signal of H-3 to collapse to a doublet. On the other hand, the irradiation at the frequency of H-3 transformed the signal of H-2 into a singlet. The proposed stereochemistry was also cor- roborated by the signal of H-4 (δ 7.30, γ position), which showed significant deshielding when compared to the (E) configuration7 caused by its proximity to the carbo- nyl group (Figure 1). The presence of a benzylic carbon in 1 was supported by the appearance of a fragment ion at m/z 135 in its MS. The assignments of methylenic protons H-7 (δ 2.59, 2H) and H-6 (δ 2.42, 2H) were confirmed by DQ-COSY spectrum, which showed cor- relation between such protons to each other. Additional correlation between proton H-6 and methine proton at H-5 (δ 5.94, 1H) was also observed. The 13C NMR data * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The lowfield region of the spectrum exhibited an amide carbonyl at δ 165.6, 10 olefinic and/or aromatic carbons and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at δ 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons based on the comparison with data described for pip- erdardine7 indicated that a 3′,4′-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present in 1. Such amides with cis geometry are quite rare in nature. To date, only two cinnamoyl pyrrolidine amides showing a cis double bond at C-2 and C-3 have been reported by Sehgal et al.9 and Kiuchi et al.10 N-[5-(3′,4′-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(E)-pentadienoyl]- pyrrolidine (2) has the molecular formula C16H19NO3 by analysis of the MS data. Its 1H NMR spectrum was identical to that published for the same compound previously isolated from Piper nigrum.10 Its 13C NMR data (Table 1) is being published for the first time. N-[2- (3′,4′-Methylenedioxy, 6′-methoxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]- pyrrolidine, a cinnamoyl pyrrolidine amide, was previ- ously isolated from P. peepuloides and was identified by comparison of its spectral data.11 The antifungal activity of amide 1 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay12 and the centerpoint-inoculation-disk assay.13 The MIC for 1 was found to be 8.0 µg. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Si gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatogra- phy unless otherwise stated, and solvents were redis- tilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reversed-phase column (Waters Nova Pack, C18; 3.9 × 150 mm) eluted with MeOH-H2O (6:4), flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and detection at 254 nm. Plant Material. P. hispidum H. B. K. (Piperaceae) leaves were collected in Parque Estadual do Morro do Diabo, Teodoro Sampaio, SP, and classified by Dr. Waldir Mantovani. The voucher specimen is deposited at Departamento de Ecologia, Instituto de Biocieˆncias- USP. Bioassays.

The micro- organism used in the antifungal assay, C. sphaerosper- mum (Pemzig) SPC 491, has been maintained at Insti- tuto de Botaˆnica. Antifungal Assay. Dilutions containing 750-1500 µg of crude extract and 100, 50, 10, 1, 0.1 µg of pure compound were applied on precoated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane-EtOAc (7:3). The chromatogram was sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum in glucose and salt solution12 and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background, indicating the minimal amount of 1 (10 µg) required for inhibition of fungal growth on TLC plate. Nystatin (5 µg) and miconazole (1 µg) were used as positive controls. Extraction and Isolation. The dried, powdered leaves of P. hispidum (3.1 g) were extracted three times at room temperature with CH2Cl2 (150 mL each) in the course of 2 days. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford 1.84 g of a green gum. Part of this extract (1.69 g) was applied to a Si gel column (300 g) and eluted with hexane contain- Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Spectral Data for Compounds 1 and 2 (δ in ppm, CDCl3) 1 2 position δH [m, J (Hz)]a δCb,c δH [m, J (Hz)]a δCb,c 1 165.6 (s) 164.7 (s) 2 5.77 (1H, d, J2,3 ) 11.4) 118.1 (d) 6.03 (d, J2,3 ) 14.8) 122.3 (d) 3 6.37 (1H, t, J3,2 and 3,4 ) 11.4) 140.4 (d) 6.85 (dt, J3,2 ) 15.0, J3,4 ) 7.0) 144.2 (d) 4 7.30 (1H, dd, J4,3 ) 11.4) 127.9 (d) 2.38 (m) 34.4 (t) 5 5.94 141.6 (d) 2.56 34.5 (t) (1H, dt, J4,5 ) 11.4, J5,6 ) 7.0) (t, J5,4 ) 7.0) 6 2.42 (m) 34.9 (t) 7 2.59 (t, J7,6 ) 7.0) 35.0 (t) 1′ 135.4 (s) 135.0 (s) 2′ 6.54 (1H, d, J2′,6′ ) 1.6) 108.1 (d) 6.58 (d, J2′,6′ ) 1.6) 108.1 (d) 3′ 145.6 (s) 145.4 (s) 4′ 147.5 (s) 147.5 (s) 5′ 6.65 (1H, d, J5′,6′ ) 7.8) 108.8 (d) 6.62 (d, J5′,6′ ) 7.8) 108.8 (d) 6′ 6.59 121.1 (d) 6.59 121.2 (d) (1H, dd, J6′,5′ ) 7.8 and J6′,2′ ) 1.6) (dd, J6′,5′ ) 7.8, J6′,2′ ) 1.6) 1′′ 3.47 (2H, t, J1′′,2′′ ) 7.0) 45.5 (t) 3.44 (t, J1′′,2′′ ) 6.5) 45.8 (t) 2′′ 1.84 26.2 (t) 1.84 (m) 26.1 (t) (2H, dt, J2′′,1′′ ) 7.0 and J2′′,3′′ ) 7.3) 3′′ 1.84 24.3 (t) 1.84 (m) 24.3 (t) (2H, dt, J2′′,3′′ ) 7.3 and J3′′,4′′ ) 7.0) 4′′ 3.39 (2H, t, J4′′,3′′ ) 7.0) 46.8 (t) 3.37 (t, J4′′,3′′ ) 6.5) 46.5 (t) O-CH2-O 5.86 (s) 100.7 (t) 5.88 (s) 100.8 (t) a Measured at 200 MHz. b Measured at 50 MHz. c Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment.

Arau´jo,‡ Cristhiane A. da Silva,‡ Marcia N. Lopes,‡ Ligia M. V. Trevisan,‡ and Vanderlan da S. Bolzani*,‡ Sec¸a˜o de Fisiologia e Bioquı´mica de Plantas, Instituto de Botaˆnica, CP. 4005, 01061-970, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil, and Instituto de Quı´mica, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Araraquara, SP, CP 355, Brazil Received October 8, 1997 A novel triterpene, viburgenin (1), has been isolated from an extract of the ripe fruit rinds of Rudgea viburnioides, together with the known saponins, arjunglucoside I and trachelosperosides B-1 and E-1, and the triterpenes trachelosperogenin B (2) and arjungenin. Compound 2 was previously obtained as a product from enzymatic hydrolysis, and it is reported for the first time as a natural product. The structure of compound 1 was determined as 2R,3â,19R,23,24- pentahydroxyurs-12-ene by extensive use of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic methods. Compound 1 exhibited moderate antifungal activity against Cladosporium cladosporioides. Rudgea viburnioides (Cham.) Benth. (Rubiaceae) is a small tree widely distributed over the “cerrado” in Brazil. The leaves and bark of this species are used traditionally in central Brazil as an antirheumatic and antisyphilitic, as well as in the treatment of dyspepsia.1 A literature search has revealed the absence of any chemical work on this species. In our continuing chemical and biological investigations of plants from the family Rubiaceae, herein we report the isolation of new triterpenes 1 and 2, together with the known triterpene arjungenin, the saponins trachelosperosides B-1 and E-1, and arjunglucoside I from the ripe fruit rinds of R. viburnioides. Compound 1 showed moderate antifungal activity against Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries (Dematiaceae). The EtOAc-soluble fraction of the aqueous ethanolic 40% extract obtained from the ripe fruit rinds of R. viburnioides yielded two new triterpenes 1 and 2 and four known compounds on repeated chromatographic purification on silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and Diaion HP-20 columns. Several known saponins and triterpe- nes were identified by their spectral data and compari- son with literature, respectively, as trachelosperoside B-1,2 trachelosperoside E-1,3 arjunglucoside I,3 and arjungenin,3,4 respectively. In addition, trachelospero- genin B (2), the aglycon of trachelosperoside B-1,2 is reported for the first time as a natural product. Viburgenin (1), obtained as a colorless powder, gave a positive Libermann-Buchard reaction. The eletro- spray mass spectral analysis (ES-MS) of 1 showed the molecular ion peak [M + Na]+ at m/z 513, corresponding to a molecular formula of C30H50O5. Six units of unsaturation were evident from the molecular formula with five of them due to a pentacyclic ring system and one due to the presence of a double bond. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3600, 3450 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum (400 MHz, C5D5N) showed spectral features typical of a highly oxygenated triterpene. The acetylation of 1 yielded a tetraacetate 1a (δ H 2.01, 2.00, 1.98, and 1.96, each 3H s) (Table 1), which had the molecular formula C38H67O9, as deduced from its MS and 13C NMR data (see the Experimental Section). The EIMS of 1 showed intense ion fragments at m/z 256 and m/z 234, due to the retro Diels-Alder fragmentation, characteristic for a ∆12 amyrin-type triterpenoid, which were attributed to the presence of four hydroxyl functions in the A/B and only one hydroxyl function in the D/E ring systems, respec- tively. The hydroxyl groups of 1 were located at C-2, C-3, C-19, C-23, and C-24 by comparison of the carbon and proton chemical shifts with the reported values for related triterpenes.2-4 Complete assignments of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of 1 were carried out by 1H-1H COSY and HMQC for direct 1JH-C conectivities and HMBC for long-range 2JH-C and 3JH-C correlations * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited the presence of an olefinic proton (δ 5.58; br s) and six signals [δ 4.45 (ddd, J ) 4.0, 9.0, 12.0 Hz), 3.66 (d, J ) 9.0 Hz), 3.99 and 4.62 (d, J ) 11.0 Hz), 4.28 and 4.88 (d, J ) 11.0 Hz)] corresponding to hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene protons. In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum showed signals due to five tertiary methyl groups (δ 0.65, 1.02, 1.17, 1.22, and 1.26) and to a secondary methyl group (δ 0.92; d, J ) 6.0 Hz). These values are quite similar to those observed for the aglycon of tracheloperoside B-1,2,3 a known compound also isolated in this study. The 13C NMR (Table 1) spectrum of 1 was almost superimposable with that of 2 (see the Experimental Section), with the only differ- ences concerning the C-17 and C-28 resonances (Table 1). The chemical shifts for these carbons in compound 1 were δ 31.9 and 27.3, respectively, which differed significantly from those of compound 3 (δ 48.8 and 179.9) due the presence of carboxyl group at C-28.2 Furthermore, the 13C NMR spectrum, analyzed with the aid of DEPT and HETCOR spectra, showed the presence of two oxygenated methines (δC 69.1, 79.8) and meth- ylenes (δC 62.9, 64.3). The foregoing suggested the presence of a urs-12-ene triterpene system hydroxylated at C-19. The relative configurations of the chiral carbons at C-2 and C-3 of 1 were assigned mainly on the basis of 1H NMR coupling data and comparison with those reported for related triterpenes.2-4 Ursane and oleanane triterpenes and their derived saponins are secondary metabolites encountered frequently in various species in the Rubiaceae.5-7 However, the occurrence of polyoxygenated ursolic and oleanolic triterpene de- rivatives is being described now for the first time in plants of this family. The known compounds already were reported as the main secondary metabolites of Trachelospermum asiaticum (Apocynaceae), a tradi- tional Japanese remedy known as “Teika-Kazura”.2 The presence of these compounds in species of the Apocyn- aceae and Rubiaceae could disclose possible evolutionary tendencies among these two families, considering the fact that Rubiaceae and Apocynaceae belong to the same morphological group of Gentianales. Viburgenin (1) showed moderate antifungal activity against C. cladosporidoides in a TLC bioassay.8 The amount of 1 required to inhibit fungal growth on a TLC plate was 50 µg. The inhibitory power displayed by 1 was considered moderate by comparison with the con- trols, nystatin (5 µg) and miconazole (1 µg). Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical ac- tivities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in C5D5N or CDCl3 on a Varian Unity 400 NMR instru- ment at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90 and 135°, respectively. The ES-MS spectra were ob- tained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 70 E-HF instrument. For column chroma- tography, Si gel 60, 70-230 mesh, Sephadex LH-20 and Diaion HP-20, was used. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 and RF-18F254 plates. Spots were visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H2SO4 after heating. Plant Material. The ripe fruit rinds of R. viburnio- ides were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guac¸u´, SP, Brazil, by M. C. M. Young in December 1993. A voucher specimen (no. SP-196941) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. Bioassay. The experimental method utilized in the bioautography assay has been described elsewhere.8 Extraction and Isolation. Dried and powdered ripe fruit rinds (2.0 kg) of R. viburnioides were extracted with aqueous EtOH (3×) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was evaporated in vacuo to give a crude extract (77 g), which was washed with EtOAc several times. The EtOAc-soluble part (2.9 g) was fractionated on silica gel column (120 g) using EtOAc-MeOH gradi- ent elutions to give six fractions. Fraction 4 (1.0 g, EtOAc-MeOH 77:15) was further fractionated by silica gel flash chromatography using CHCl3-MeOH (64:36) and CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (64:36:8). Altogether, 146 fractions were collected, and fractions 21-32 (240 mg) were fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH- CHCl3 (9:1) to give 1 (24 mg), trachelosperoside B-1 (15 mg), trachelosperogenin B (2, 51 mg), and trachelo- speroside E-1 (36 mg). Fractions 95-117 (57 mg) were submitted to chromatography column on Diaion HP-20 using MeOH-H2O (1:1). The combined fractions 7-9 from this column were fractionated further on silica gel (13 g) using CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (77:15:8) to give tra- chelosperoside B (37 mg) and arjungenin (12 mg). The residue (10 g) obtained from washing with EtOAc was extracted with n-BuOH (3×) at room temperature. The Table 1.

This flagel- late protozoan is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, an illness that affects 16–18 million peo- ple in Central and South America, and led to 14,470 deaths in 2002 [1]. At the moment, blood transfusion is one of the most important ways of transmission of this disease. However, gentian violet, the only trypanocidal substance available to prevent the infection by this route, shows limi- ted use due to undesirable effects on the patients [2]. Furthermore, the treatment of Chagas' dis- ease is still insufficient since the two available drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, can only be used for the early chronic phase of the illness. Ac- cording to the World Heatlh Organization (WHO), discovery and development of more effective and better tolerated drugs are still research challenges [3]. Thus, the search for both a prophylactic drug to be added to human blood as well as a safe and reliable therapeutic drug is needed. In this context, higher plants are a potential source of compounds with high activity and low toxicity [4], [5]. In fact, the investigation of these compounds has received increasing attention in the past years [6] and several active natural prod- ucts have been identified as trypanocides [4], [5], [7], [8], [9]. We have investigated plants from the order Ru- tales with the aim to identify biologically active compounds. We have also found that a number of natural products from Meliaceae and Rutaceae showed in vitro activity against T. cruzi [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Moreover, the Melia- ceae family has been pointed out as an important source of lead trypanocidal compounds [10], [14], [17], [18]. So, due to this high biological potential, we chose to investigate the species Cedrela fissilis, to search for new trypanocidal compounds. In this paper, we report the trypanocidal activity of 15 crude extracts, and 14 compounds includ- ing limonoids and triterpenes from Cedrela fissilis. We also describe the identification of 25 compounds (6 limonoids, 12 triterpenes, 1 ses- quiterpene, 5 steroids, and 1 flavonoid) from this species for the first time. Materials and Methods General procedures Compounds were identified through NMR and low resolution EI-MS, which were acquired on Bruker DRX 400 and on Micromass Quattro LC in- struments, respectively. Abstract Chagas' disease is an illness that affects millions of people in Central and South America. The search for both a prophylactic drug to be added to human blood as well as a safe and reliable therapeutic drug are greatly needed to control such disease. Herein, we report the trypanocidal activity of 15 crude extracts and 14 compounds (limonoids and triterpenes) as well as the isola- tion of 25 known compounds (6 limonoids,12 tri- terpenes,1 sesquiterpene, 5 steroids, and 1 flavo- noid) from Cedrela fissilis. The present study shows that this plant is a promising source of ac- tive compounds for the control of Chagas' dis- ease. The inhibitory activity found for odoratol indicates that it is potentially useful as an alter- native for the chemoprophylactic gentian vio- let. Leite ACet al. Trypanocidal Activity of… Planta Med 2008; 74: 1795–1799 Downloaded by: University of Queensland. Copyrighted material. Plant material Fruits, branches, stems, roots and leaves from Cedrela fissilis Vell. were collected in São Carlos-SP, Brazil, on 01/06/01 and identi- fied by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP where a voucher specimen (6701) was depos- ited at that department. Extraction and isolation The powdered air-dried parts of C. fissilis were extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The hexane extract from the roots of C. fissilis (RH, 3.5 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70–230 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 1.5 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The dichloromethane fraction (RHD, 834.1 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm), eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (8:1.5:0.5) to give 9 fractions. Fraction 2 (RHD-2, 290.5 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm), using hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone (8:1.5:0.5) to yield compound 19 (28.0 mg). Several column chromatographies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm, eluent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) and Sephadex LH-20 (3×50 cm, eluent MeOH) of the acetate ethyl fraction (RHA, 704.8 mg) allowed the isolation of the triterpene 18 (11.5 mg). The dichloromethane extract from roots (RD, 1.0 g) was fractio- nated through column chromatography on silica gel (70– 230 mesh, 4×45 cm), eluting with hexane to MeOH, to afford nine fractions. Limonoid 1 (12.1 mg) was obtained from fraction 5 (RD-5, 143.0 mg) through three successive chromatography columns on silica gel (70–230 and 230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm) and gradient elution (hexane to MeOH and hexane-CH2Cl2-ace- tone, 6:3:1). Fraction 6 (RD-6, 192.0 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×50 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (6:3:1) to yield compounds 3 (1.3 mg) and 10 (1.1 mg). The dichloromethane extract from leaves (LD, 29.0 g) was sub- mitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70– 230 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 2 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The dichloromethane fraction (LD-D, 6.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh) and florisil (1:1, 4.5×50 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane to MeOH) to afford 12 fractions. From fraction 4 (LD-D-4, 1.2 g), after two col- umn chromatographies on silica (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm, elu- ent hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3.5:0.5) and HPLC on silica Hyper- sil 5 μm column (1×29 cm), with hexane-2-propanol (8.5:1.5) isocratic elution and UV detection at 240 nm, limonoid 2 (5.1 mg) was isolated. Fraction 7 (LD-D-7, 800.3 mg) was chro- matographed twice on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 3×45 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3.5:0.5) to yield compound 5 (3.5 mg). The chromatographic separation of fraction 9 (LD-D-9, 1.0 g) by column chromatography (silica gel 70–230 mesh, 3×35 cm, elu- ent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 7:2:1) and normal HPLC (Hypersil 5 μm column, 1×29 cm, hexane-2-propanol 9:1, UV detection at 220 nm) afforded limonoids 4 (9.3 mg) and 6 (4.5 mg). The methanol extract from stems (SM, 40.0 g) was submitted to liquid-liquid partition chromatography with hexane-MeOH- H2O, CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O, EtOAc-MeOH-H2O, and n-butanol- MeOH-H2O. The hexane and dichloromethane fractions (SM- HD, 11.8 g) were chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 (4×50 cm) using CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1) as eluent to give 10 fractions. Several chromatographic procedures on silica (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm) and cromatotron of fraction 2 (SM-2, 2.3 g), using both isocratic (hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3.5:0.5) and gradient elution (CH2Cl2 until MeOH), allowed the isolation of 7 (35.6 mg), 8 (40.2 mg), and 14 (32.7 mg). Fraction 4 (SM-4, 3.5 g) was submitted to two column chromatographies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×45 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9.5:0.5) and cromatotron, with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3:1) elution, to afford 11 (33.5 mg) and 12 (23.1 mg). Compounds 9 (10.1 mg) and 13 (13.2 mg) were obtained from fraction 7 (SM-7, 2.1 g) through column chromatography on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9.5:0.5) and cromatotron (eluent hexane- CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3:1). The dichloromethane extract from fruits (FD, 5.0 g) was submit- ted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (230– 400 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 1.5 L of CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The ethyl acetate fraction (FDA, 3.0 g) was submitted to column chromatography on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) to yield 7 frac- tions. Fraction 2 (FDA-2, 715.0 mg) was twice chromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (6:3:1) to afford compounds 16 (36.5 mg) and 17 (25.9 mg). The triterpene 15 (4.3 mg) was obtained through col- umn chromatography on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 1.5×20 cm, eluent hexane-EtOAc, 7:3) and Sephadex LH-20 (1.5×30 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 1:1) from fraction 3 (FDA-3, 633.2 mg). Finally, the flavonoid 20 (48.9 mg) was isolated from the metha- nol extract from fruits (FM) through several column chromatog- raphies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×35 cm, eluent hexane until MeOH) and Sephadex-LH-20 (1.5×30 cm, eluent MeOH). Bioassay The procedure for in vitro assays on blood trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi was previously described by Ambrozin et al. [10]. Di- methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to prepare standard solu- tions of the crude extracts and compounds, which were added to the infected mouse blood to provide concentrations of 4 mg/ mL and 50, 100, and 250 μg/mL, respectively. The final concen- tration of DMSO was 1% (v/v). The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) that were incubated at 4°C for 24 h. The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (μmol/L) for pure com- pounds were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0. Results and Discussion In the present work, we assessed the trypanocidal activity of 15 extracts from fruits, branches, stems, roots and leaves of C. fissilis. The results, which are summarized in ● Table 1, showed that 11 extracts (73%) were significantly active (lysis% ≥50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. Moreover, nine of them presented lysis in the 60–80% range; the dichloro- methane extract of roots (RD) was the most active, reducing the number of parasites in the infected blood by 97.4%. Such results suggest that C. fissilis is really a promising source of trypanocidal compounds, as we expected from the previous works that had reported the antiprotozoal action of Meliaceae plants [10], [14], [16], [17], [18]. Thus, we carried out the chemical investigation of C. fissilis with the aim to isolate the compounds from some ac- tive extracts (RD, LD, FD, FM, and SM), and one inactive extrtact (RH). This work allowed the isolation of the limonoids (● Fig. 1): Original Paper 1796 Leite ACet al. Trypanocidal Activity of… Planta Med 2008; 74: 1795–1799 Downloaded by: University of Queensland. Copyrighted material. 3β-acetoxycarapin (1) [19], 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (2) [20], gedunin (3) [20], photogedunin (4), methyl angolensate (5), and 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (6) [20]; the triter- penes: hispidol A (7), piscidinol A (8), pentaol (9), nilocetin (10), odoratol (11), iso-odoratol (12), odoratone (13), 22S,3α-di- hydrotirucala-7,24-dien-23-one (14), 3,11-dioxoolean-12-en-28- onic acid (15), oleanonic acid (16) [19], oleanolic acid (17) [19], and 24-methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-one (18); the sequi- terpene criptomeridiol (19); the flavonoid ent-catechin (20); in addition to the steroids β-sitosterol, stigmaterol, campesterol, sitostenone, and 3β-O-β-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol. Fourteen compounds were assayed in vitro against the trypo- mastigote forms of T. cruzi (● Table 2). The results showed that the tirucallane-type triterpenes (7–13) were the most active ones. The results in ● Table 2 show that the trypanocidal activi- ty of odoratol (11) was better than that of gentian violet, the pos- itive control, when we compared the evaluated concentrations. This triterpene was isolated from the methanol extract from stems (SM, 58.0%), together with the tirucallane triterpenes his- pidol A (7), piscidinol A (8), pentaol (9), iso-odoratol (12), odor- atone (13) and 22S,3α-dihydrotirucala-7,24-dien-23-one (14).

Copyrighted material. a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran seem to enhance the trypanocidal activity of tirucallane triterpenes. So, odoratol (11) and iso-odor- atol (12) showed higher activity than hispidol A (7) and odora- tone (13). On the other hand, odoratone (13) was more active than piscidinol A (8). In general, oleanane-type triterpenes (15–17) were more active than limonoids (1–4), but less active than tirucallane triter- penes (7–13). They were isolated from the active dichlorome- thane extract from fruits of C. fissilis (FD, 75.4%) together with photogedunin (4). Among them, oleanolic acid (17) showed the highest activity displaying an IC50 value of 80.4 μM, which is near to the one observed for gentian violet [21]. It seems that for this class of compounds the trypanocidal activity is related to the presence of a hydroxy group at C-3. This observation cor- roborates the statement by Cunha et al [21], [22] that the free hydroxy at C-3 and the polarity of C-28 are the most influential structural features for the in vitro trypanocidal activity of olea- nane triterpenes. Besides anti-inflammatory, immunomodulato- ry, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimutagenic, antihepatotoxic, anti- diabetic, hemolytic, antiviral and antibacterial activity [23], the trypanocidal action of oleanane triterpenes has already been de- scribed previously [21], [22], [24], [25], [26]. Actually, oleanolic acid (17) showed trypanocidal activity on both trypomastigote [21], [25] and epimastigote forms [24], [26] of T. cruzi. Mexicanolide and gedunin-type limonoids (1–4) showed low trypanocidal activity. In a previous work, mexicanolide limo- noids displayed only weak activity on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi [14]. These results suggest that tirucallane-type triterpenes are a promising class of new trypanocidal compounds. The high try- panocidal activity of odoratol (11) (100% at 100 μg/mL) indicates that it has potential as an alternative for the chemoprophylactic gentian violet, which has many side effects [2]. However, toxicity assays have not been performed for 11 yet. In conclusion, the present study showed that C. fissilis, a plant from the Meliaceae family, is a promising source of active com- pounds for control of Chagas' disease. Specifically, we demon- strate the potential activity of tirucallane and oleanane-type tri- terpenes. The high activity of odoratol (11) is promising although it asks for further optimization and for assessment of toxicity.

Chagasʼ disease (American trypanosomiasis) af- fects 16–18 million people, mostly from Central and South America, where 25% of the total popu- lation are at risk of infection [1]. The treatment of Chagasʼ disease is still a challenge, since the cur- rently available drugs, nifurtimox (Lampit®, dis- continued by Bayer), a nitrofuran derivative, and benznidazole (Rochagan®, Roche), a nitroimida- zole derivative, have shown limited efficacy, strong side effects, and low effectiveness [2]. The Peperomia genus belongs to the Piperaceae family and consists of approximately 1700 spe- cies [3]. In contrast to the extensive studies in- volving compounds isolated from Piper species [4,5], only a few species of Peperomia have been subjected to systematic phytochemical investiga- tion. Peperomia obtusifolia is a well-known orna- mental plant distributed from Mexico to South America. A previous phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of P. obtusifolia showed the presence of five phenolic compounds bearing methyl, prenyl and geranyl groups [6]. This study describes the isolation and in vitro evaluation of the trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi (Y-strain) and unspecific cyto- toxicity of seven known compounds (l \" Fig. 1) from the active fractions of the ethanol extracts of Peperomia obtusifolia leaves and stems. This is the first report of the isolation of compound 2, the chromane 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-di- methyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl- 1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylic acid, from Peperomia obtusifolia. Materials and Methods ! Plant material Leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia A. Diet- er were collected in Poços de Caldas, MG, Brazil and identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). The voucher speci- men (KATO 070) has been deposited at the Her- bário do Estado “Maria Eneyda P. Kaufmann Fidal- go” (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Abstract ! The trypanocidal activity of crude extracts and fractions from the leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia (Piperaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most active extracts afforded seven known com- pounds, including three chromanes, two furofur- an lignans and two flavone C-diglycosides. The most active compounds were the chromanes pe- perobtusin A and 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-di- methyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl- 1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylic acid, with IC50 values of 3.1 µM (almost three times more active than the positive control benz- nidazole, IC50 10.4 µM) and 27.0 µM, respectively. Cytotoxicity assays using peritoneal murine mac- rophages indicated that the chromanes were not toxic at the level of the IC50 for trypanocidal activ- ity.

Extraction and isolation The powdered air-dried leaves (600 g) and stems (64 g) were ex- tracted at room temperature with EtOH (4 × 2500 mL, 72 h each and 4 × 500 mL, 72 h each; respectively). The crude leaves extract (39.6 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of H2O/ MeOH (20:80 v/v) and partitioned using Hex (3 × 35 mL), Hex/ EtOAc (30:70 v/v) (3 × 35 mL) and EtOAc (3 × 35 mL), which af- forded EL‑H, EL‑HE, EL‑E and EL‑MH fractions, respectively. EL‑H (15.5 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20–63 µm, 7 × 15 cm) eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc and EtOAc-MeOH (3 L and 1.5 L, respectively), yielding 26 frac- tions (170 mL each, A-1 to A-26). Compound 1 (50 mg) was ob- tained from A-7 (320 mg) by recrystallization in MeOH (45°C). EL‑HE (2.2 g) was submitted to low-pressure column chromatog- raphy over a C18 column (4 × 18 cm), under gradient elution (5– 100% MeOH in H2O) (1.5 L) yielding 14 fractions (100 mL each, B-1 to B-14). B-7 (232.8 mg) after semipreparative reversed phase HPLC (C18, 10 µm, 250 mm × 21.2 mm, MeOH/H2O 65:35 v/v, flow-rate 16 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm), yielded 2 (40 mg, Rt = 19.8 min). Compounds 3 (6 mg, Rt = 7.8 min) and 4 (7.2 mg, Rt = 12.4 min) were purified from B- 9 (160.0 mg) under the same conditions as for B-7. EL‑MH (10.8 g) was subjected to low-pressure column chroma- tography over a C18 column (5 × 28 cm), under gradient elution (5–100% MeOH in H2O) affording 14 fractions (C-1 to C-14). C-8 and C-9 (165 and 168 mg, respectively) were pooled and then subjected to semipreparative HPLC (phenyl-hexyl, 10 µm, 250 mm × 21.2 mm, MeOH/AcOH aqueous 0.5%, 22:78 v/v, flow rate 14 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm) to yield 5 (23 mg, Rt = 20 min). The stems ethanol extract (5.7 g) was dissolved in 60 mL of H2O/ MeOH (20:80 v/v) and partitioned using hexane, EtOAc and n- BuOH (3 × 20 mL each) to give ES‑H, ES‑E and ES‑B fractions, re- spectively. ES‑H (2 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20–63 µm, 3 × 12 cm) eluted with hexane-EtOAc and an EtOAc-MeOH gradient (300 mL and 150 mL, respectively), to afford 13 fractions (50 mL each, D-1 to D-13). D-5 (60 mg) was purified using preparative TLC with toluene/hexane (20:80 v/v) yielding 6 (5 mg, Rf = 0.7) and 7 (2 mg, Rf = 0.75). For compounds 1, 2, 5–7, the purity (> 99%) was determined by HPLC analysis us- ing a diode-array detector (monitoring at λ = 254 nm) and two different chromatographic conditions (C8 and C18 stationary phases). Melting points of compounds 3 and 4 were determined and were in accordance with literature values. Fig. 1 Structures of compounds isolated from Peperomia obtusifolia. 621 da Silva Mota J et al.

HPLC and specific rotation analysis Analytical and semipreparative HPLC separations were per- formed using stainless-steel Phenomenex Luna® columns (250 × 4.6 mm I.D., 5 µm C8 and C18; 250 × 21.2 mm I.D., 10 µm; C18 and Pheny-hexyl; Phenomenex). Methanol was obtained from J.T. Baker. HPLC separations were carried out using a Varian Prepstar SD-1 equipped with a Rheodyne (Cotati) injector with a 2 mL sample loop and a Varian ProStar 320 UV‑Vis detector. Spe- cific rotations of the isolated compounds dissolved in chloroform were measured on a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter equipped with a Na lamp operating at 589 nm. Trypanocidal assay [7] An in vitro assay was performed measuring the proliferation of Y- strain epimastigotes growing in axenic culture. The samples to be tested were stored as 1 mg/mL stock solutions in dimethyl sulfox- ide (DMSO) and were serially diluted in LIT medium before use. The crude extracts, fractions and pure compounds were tested at 0.4, 1.2, 3.7, 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 µg/mL, in triplicate, using 1 × 105 epimastigotes/well. The number of remaining viable pro- tozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber fol- lowing incubation at 28°C for 72 h with the test samples. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and statistical data were determined with the probit analysis method using GW-BA- SIC 2.33 (Microsoft Software, 1987). The positive control benzni- dazole (> 99% of purity by HPLC) was obtained from Rochagan® tablets (Roche Brazil). Cytotoxicity assay The unspecific cytotoxic activity was determined according to the method of Mosmann, with minimal modifications [8]. Briefly, Balb/c isogenic mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 3 mL of sodium thioglycolate 3%. The animals were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber 3 days after inoculation. The peritoneal macrophages were extracted by injecting phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) followed by slight massage and suction using a syringe. The cells were transferred to a sterile tube in an ice bath and cellular suspension was prepared after centrifugation. The sediment cells were resus- pended in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ mL of streptomycin, 100 U/mL of penicillin and 5 × 10−2 M of β mercaptoethanol at density of 5 × 106 cells/mL (stock suspen- sion). In a 96-wells microtiter tray, 100 µL of cells from the stock suspension and 100 µL of test solutions dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium (final concentrations: 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 µg/ mL), were added. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C and 7.5% CO2, 100 µL of an MTT solution (2.5 mg/mL) were added to each well and incubated for 3 h under the same conditions. The optical density (590 nm) of the formazan crystals dissolved in 2-propa- nol was measured and compared with the negative control (only RPMI). The positive control for the trypanocidal assay (benznida- zole) was also evaluated. All treatments were performed in trip- licate and the IC50 values (with 95% confidence intervals), were determined by linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Software). Results and Discussion ! In this work, we assessed the anti-trypanosomal activity of crude extracts from the leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia, and their fractions obtained by liquid-liquid partition against the epi- mastigote forms of the Trypanosoma cruzi Y-strain. The crude ethanol extract from the leaves of P. obtusifolia showed significant trypanocidal activity (IC50 of 4.3 µg/mL) when com- pared to the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 2.7 µg/mL) (l \" Table 1). Thus, this extract was fractionated and all fractions EL-H, EL-HE, EL-E and EL-MH (IC50 of 3.9, 0.2, 5.6 and 7.7 µg/mL, respectively) were also active, with EL‑HE being the most active with an IC50 of 0.2 µg/mL. The crude ethanol extract from the stems of P. obtusifolia showed lower activity than EL (IC50 of 23.2 µg/mL), nevertheless it was partitioned as well. All fractions were tested and the hexane (ES‑H) and ethyl acetate (ES‑E) frac- tions were the most active with IC50 values of 2.8 and 7.2 µg/mL, respectively. Chemical investigations of the active fractions led to seven (1 – 7, l \" Fig. 1) known compounds: the chromanes 3,4-dihydro-5-hy- droxy-2,7-dimethyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl-1′, 3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (1) [9], pe- perobtusin A (6) [6] and clusifoliol (7) [6], [10]; the furofuran lig- nans 2-episesalatin (3) [11] and sesartemin (4) [12]; and the flavone C-diglycosides isoswertisin-4′-methyl-ether-2′′α-L-rham- noside (2) and isoswertisin-2′′α-L-rhamnoside (5) [13,14]. The structures of 1 – 7 were confirmed by IR, MS, 1H-, 13C‑NMR and 2D NMR spectral data, which were in agreement with the re- ported data for the respective compounds. Compounds 1, 6 and 7 had an optical activity [α]D 25: 0° (c. 1.0, CHCl3) suggesting a racemic mixture in the molecules bearing a chiral center at C-2. These results are in accordance with the data Table 1 In vitro trypanocidal activity of extracts and fractions from Peperomia obtusifolia (Piperaceae) against epimastigote forms of Trypanosama cruzi Y- straina.

This is the first report of the isolation of compound 1 from P. obtusifolia. It had previously been re- ported from Peperomia amplexicaulis [9]. The trypanocidal activity of the isolated compounds was deter- mined using benznidazole as the positive control (IC50 of 10.4 µM, l \" Table 2). The chromanes 1, 6 and 7 showed better try- panocidal activity, with IC50 values of 27.0, 3.1 and 47.5 µM re- spectively, than the lignans and glycosylflavones isolated. The po- tent trypanocidal activity observed for these compounds bearing a benzopyran nucleus substituted with isoprenyl moieties sup- ports our recent report which showed the trypanocidal activity of chromenes isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. adun- cum and semisynthetic derivatives [7]. Even though the furofuran lignans 2-episesalatin (3) and sesarte- min (4) had been isolated from the most active fraction EL‑HE (IC50 of 0.2 µg/mL, l \" Table 1) they showed weak activity, indicat- ing loss of the trypanocidal activity during fractionation. The fla- vone C-diglycosides 2 and 5 isolated from the leaves of P. obtusifo- lia did not display any trypanocidal activity (l \" Table 2). As ob- served for the inactive lignans 3 and 4, the further chromato- graphic fractionation of the active EL‑MH fraction (IC50 of 7.7 µg/mL) resulted in the isolation of inactive compounds. De- spite the negative results obtained for the flavone C-diglycosides 2 and 5 as well as for lignans 3 and 4 in the trypanocidal assay, further studies of EL‑HE and EL‑MH could be promising for the search of new trypanocidal compounds. The most active compounds 1 and 6 were also evaluated for their unspecific cytotoxicity in mammalian cells (murine peritoneal macrophages), and the obtained values indicated that chromanes were not toxic at the level of their trypanocidal activity (IC50 of 405.0 and 402.1 µM, l \" Table 2). Nevertheless, the cytotoxic activ- ity of 1 and 6 was higher than that of benznidazole (IC50 of 1138.0 µM, l \" Table 2), which was included in order to establish a comparison with the only drug available for the treatment of Chagasʼ disease. As selectivity is a relevant characteristic for de- fining lead molecules, the cytotoxicities were compared to the antiparasitic activities by calculating the SI (selectivity index) [16]. The SI values for 1, 6 and benznidazole were 14.9, 130.4 and 109, respectively, suggesting that 1 and particularly 6 have good selectivity for T. cruzi epimastigotes when compared with benznidazole. In conclusion, the present investigation revealed that the bioas- say-guided fractionation of extracts from the leaves and stems of P. obtusifolia led to the isolation of prenylated benzopyrans with potent anti-trypanosomal activity and a good selectivity in- dex when assayed in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that Piperaceae species are an important source of new trypano- cidal compounds. More extensive and detailed studies on the try- panocidal activity of natural chromanes as well as chromane de- rivatives should be undertaken in order to provide an under- standing of structural requirements for biological activity.

An estimated 48610 new cases of leukemia and 23720 deaths due to it were expected to occur in the US in 2013 [1]. Leukemia is a broad term cov- ering a variety of diseases. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The prognosis of APL has been considerably en- hanced by the use of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). The use of these drugs is, however, narrowed by resistance to ATRA and the side effects of ATO [2], motivating the explo- ration for compounds bearing new mechanisms of action. In our search to find endophytes in medicinal As- teraceae as potential new anticancer secondary metabolite producers, we have isolated several endophytic fungi from Yacon tissues. Among them, Papulaspora immersa H.H. Hoston (Chaeto- miaceae) and Nigrospora sphaerica (Sacc.) E.W. Mason (Trichosphaeriaceae) yielded the natural products (22E,24R)-8,14-epoxyergosta-4,22-di- ene-3,6-dione (a) and aphidicolin (b), respective- ly (l \" Fig. 1). These agents exhibit cytotoxic activ- ities against some human tumor cells, including HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (IC50 values of 1.65 µM and 0.27 µM, correspondingly) [3,4]. Aphidicolin is an antibiotic and cytotoxic diter- pene first isolated from cultures of the fungus Cephalosporium aphidicola Petch (Hypocreaceae). This agent prevents DNA synthesis by inhibition of DNA polymerase α and δ [5], binding reversibly to the enzymes and not to DNA, and is selectively toxic in the S-phase of the cell cycle [6]. Schimke and coworkers demonstrated that the mode of ac- tion of (b) on HeLaS3 cells depends on the con- centration and duration of exposure, ranging from complete apoptosis in the early S-phase to inhibition of progression through the S-phase to different degrees, with cells eventually under- going mitosis with the extensive generation of microcells. They also observed that some cells “escaped” the early S-phase apoptotic position, Abstract ! As a result of a program to find antitumor com- pounds of endophytes from medicinal Asteraceae, the steroid (22E,24R)-8,14-epoxyergosta-4,22-di- ene-3,6-dione (a) and the diterpene aphidicolin (b) were isolated from the filamentous fungi Pa- pulaspora immersa and Nigrospora sphaerica, re- spectively, and exhibited strong cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells. A proteomic approach was used in an attempt to identify the drugsʼ molecu- lar targets and their respective antiproliferative mode of action. Results suggested that the (a) growth inhibition effect occurs by G2/M cell cycle arrest via reduction of tubulin alpha and beta iso- mers and 14–3–3 protein gamma expression, fol- lowed by a decrease of apoptotic and inflamma- tory proteins, culminating in mitochondrial oxi- dative damage that triggered autophagy-associ- ated cell death. Moreover, the decrease observed in the expression levels of several types of histo- nes indicated that (a) might be disarming onco- genic pathways via direct modulation of the epi- genetic machinery. Effects on cell cycle progres- sion and induction of apoptosis caused by (b) were confirmed. In addition, protein expression profiles also revealed that aphidicolin is able to influence microtubule dynamics, modulate pro- teasome activator complex expression, and con- trol the inflammatory cascade through overex- pression of thymosin beta 4, RhoGDI2, and 14–3– 3 proteins. Transmission electron micrographs of (b)-treated cells unveiled dose-dependent mor- phological characteristics of autophagy- or onco- sis-like cell death.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. transitioned to aberrant mitosis, and underwent apoptosis as a consequence of aberrant mitotic events [7]. The study of HL-60 cells shows that (b) increases the phosphorylation of histone H2AX in the early S-phase, inducing DNA damage [8]. Activation of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was also detected [9], perhaps ex- plaining the synergistic effect that (b) exhibits in the combined treatment of HL-60 cells with ATRA [10]. Epoxyergostane-type steroids have exhibited cytotoxicity against a variety of tumor cell lines. For example, 2 µM stoloniferones from the soft coral Clavularia (Clavularidae) cause 69% of the growth inhibition of P-388 leukemia cells [11]; withaferin A, present in some genera of Solanaceae, displays IC50 values in the range of 0.5 to 2.2 µM against several cancer cell lines [12]. Steroid-based regimens are frequently used to treat APL patients affected with retinoic acid syndrome, a serious complication de- rived from the treatment with ATRA. Dexamethasone (DEX), one of the most used synthetic glucocorticoids (GC) to treat that problem, also displays an antiproliferative effect itself [13], and bears structural resemblance with human GCs. In general, the ef- fect of GCs on lymphoid cells includes G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [14]. GCs mediate many of their anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects through the inhibition of NF-ĸB [15]. Laane et al. showed that DEX-induced cell death involves autophagy triggered by dephosphorylation of Akt preceding the manifesta- tion of a massive mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [16]. Sama- di et al. described the antiproliferative action of withaferin A through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, also a result of Akt deactivation [12]. The present investigation was undertaken in an attempt to eluci- date the actual mechanism behind the induction of HL-60 cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity by compounds (a) and (b) us- ing a proteomic approach. Results ! Taking into account what is known regarding the cytotoxicity of fungal secondary metabolites [3,4], the HL-60 promyelocytic leu- kemia cell line was chosen. The cells were treated with (a) and (b), and the proteomes of drug-treated and control cells were de- termined to find the proteins with altered levels. It was hoped that an analysis would aid in finding the drugsʼ antiproliferative modes of action. After 48 h of treatment, cells were harvested, counted, and the cell growth inhibitory activity was determined (l \" Table 1), cor- roborating the earlier observed cytotoxic outcomes. Subse- quently, cellular proteins were extracted using two different but consecutive lysis buffers, a modified RIPA (radio immunoprecipi- tation assay) buffer, and a urea-based buffer. Aliquots of the ex- tracts containing 100 µg of protein were denatured, reduced, al- kylated, digested, and labeled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) 8-plex reagents. Samples were submitted to strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography us- ing a salt gradient elution, and fractions were subsequently frac- tionated by nanoHPLC. MALDI/TOF‑MS/MS analysis of the LC-fractionated iTRAQ-la- beled peptides from the RIPA- and urea-based buffersʼ lysates of (b)-treated cells (l \" Tables 2 and 3, respectively) revealed that cells treated with 0.4 µM (b) exhibited significant elevated levels of several proteins like POTEF, transgelin-2, tubulin α, stathmin (STAT), and RhoGDI2, among others. Lowered levels of histones H2A type 1 and H1.4, and the proteasome activator complex sub- unit 1 were also observed. Cells treated with 2.66 µM (b) showed a similar protein profile except that tubulin α, cofilin-1, and 14– 3–3 proteins were present at control levels. MS/MS analyses of fractions derived from cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) displayed significant lowered levels of all the proteins detected in the RIPA lysates (l \" Table 2), as well some members of the 14–3–3 protein family and hnRNP A2/B1 from urea lysates (l \" Table 3). Notably, the majority of proteins detected from cells treated with a higher concentration (4.95 µM) of (a) exhibited protein levels equivalent to the untreated cells, except for the lev- els of RhoGDI2, SET, TB4, MIF, and some 14–3–3 protein isomers that were lowered. Cell cycle progression and cell death were examined with flow cytometric analyses. HL-60 cells treated with 0.4 µM (b) showed significant arrest in the S-phase (l \" Table 4), and cells underwent apoptosis, which was markedly increased in 2.66 µM (b)-treated cells Cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) showed a moderate G2/M-phase arrest, which increased significantly in cells treated with 4.95 µM (a), but no apoptosis was observed (l \" Table 4). In order to ascertain how (a)-treated cells died, and to correlate death with the changes in protein levels, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses were per- formed. Representative SEM micrographs of untreated and (a)- treated HL-60 cells are shown in l \" Fig. 2. Untreated cells exhib- ited a rounded and smooth surface (l \" Fig. 2C) while cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) had a moderate reduction in size accompanied by a lumpy and blebbing membrane (l \" Fig. 2A). Cells treated with 4.95 µM (a) showed a complex surface morphology with a combination of a coarse membrane presenting scale-like ultra- structures, a smooth surface with numerous folds (l \" Fig. 2B), and some microvilli or accentuated blebs. TEM micrographs of untreated cells (l \" Fig. 3C) showed a few enlarged rough endo- plasmic reticula (ER); mitochondria (MT) were either elongated or rounded with simple tubular cristae; vacuolar and granular Table 1 Growth inhibition of HL-60 cells caused by (22E,24R)-8,14-epoxyer- gosta-4,22-diene-3,6-dione (a) and aphidicolin (b).

Cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) displayed marked swelling of MT with vacuolization, disintegrated cristae, de- creased matrix density, and, eventually, rupture of the mem- brane (l \" Fig. 3A); increases in peroxisome and dilated ER num- bers were observed. Also, ER invagination and engulfing of cyto- plasmic organelles occurred, initiating the formation of autopha- gic vacuoles (AV) as suggested by Dunn jr. [17].

SEM analysis of cells treated with 0.4 µM (b) exhibited surfaces with extensive microvilli or blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies (AB; l \" Fig. 2D).

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. death was occurring [18]. Alternatively, some cells displayed apoptosis features. To further validate the level of differentially expressed proteins, Western blotting analyses were carried out (l \" Fig. 4). The over- expression of STAT and TB4 by (b)-treated cells was confirmed as well as the hypo-expression of tubulin by (a)-treated cells. Discussion ! With respect to the mode of action of (b), an apoptotic profile was confirmed by SEM and TEM micrographs and seems to be orchestrated by the increased levels of POTEF (a protein reported to function as a proapoptotic factor [19]), hnRNP A2/B, and RhoG- DI2. Higher levels of RhoGDI2 ultimately sensitize HL-60 cells to caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [20], and elicit an autoimmune re- sponse in acute leukemia [21]. RhoGDI2, along with hnRNP A2/ B1, are among the ten most frequently observed human proteins in proteome analyses of apoptotic cells [22]. The Rho family of GTPases plays an important role in cell morphology, cell cycle, and programmed cell death progression, controlling actin cytos- keleton rearrangement, blebbing, fragmentation, and phagocyto- sis of apoptotic cells [23]. Moreover, lowered levels of hnRNP A2/ B1, SET, and RhoGDI2 indicate chemoresistance in ovarian tumor tissues treated with paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer and apo- ptosis-inducing drug [24]. Microtubules are formed by alpha and beta tubulin heterodimers that have a short half-life, so they are in constant assembly or disassembly, a dynamic instability con- trolled by STAT, which promotes depolymerization of microtu- bules and/or prevents polymerization of tubulin heterodimers. Overexpression of STAT in mitotic cells induces a misaligned dis- tribution of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, impairing the formation of a functional mitotic spindle [25]. The aberrant chro- mosome segregation and cell division observed by Schimke et al. [7] in HeLaS3 cells treated with (b) might be a consequence from defects in assembly and a function of the mitotic spindle caused by STAT overload, which also activates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [26]. The hypo-expression of histones H2A and H1.4 observed in cells treated with (b) corroborates the results of Kurose et al. [8], sug- gesting that DNA damage and cell growth arrest caused by (b) in- volve those proteins that may be downregulated by the increased level of SET, a multitasking protein subunit of the INHAT complex (inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases) [27]. It is known that H1.2 inhibition causes defects in the chromatin structure and changes in the expression of specific genes linked to the cell cycle [28]. The observed decreased level of proteasome activator com- plex subunit 1, which is involved in DNA damage response and the S-phase of mitotic cell cycle arrest, might also play an addi- tional role in this process. Increased levels of cofilin-1 and trans- gelin-2, proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization [29,30], reinforce the hypothesis that the tumor suppressor activity of (b) might occur by actin destabilization. In relation to the mode of action of compound (a), the observed downregulation of 14–3–3 proteins could influence the G2/M transition of the mitotic cells cycle, thereby directing the cell to die by means other than apoptosis. It is well known that a reduc- tion in 14–3–3 proteins accelerates cell death and enhances sen- sitivity to DNA damage-inducing drugs [31]. In addition, dimin- ished levels of MIF, a proinflammatory cytokine capable of mod- ulating the expression of the tumor suppressor TP53 (a.k.a. p53), ultimately causing tumor growth and invasiveness, might be adding some effect in the cell cycle regulation and consequent in- hibition of cell growth. MIF is overexpressed in several types of cancer and its blocking has been proposed as a strategy in the control of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [32]. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) has also been detected at high levels in a number of leuke- mia types. Promyelocytes and promyelomonocytes produce MPO during inflammation and under oxidative stress conditions [33]. High levels of MPO can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are considered the lynchpin in leukemia relapse and drug re- sistance [34,35]. The observed decrease in MPO and MIF indi- cates an apparent anti-inflammatory/antioxidant action of (a). It is interesting to note that anti-MIF immunoglobulin and nonster- oidal, anti-inflammatory drugs are employed in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of some types of cancer [36]. Thymosin β4 (TB4) operates in cytoskeleton reorganization, se- questering gamma actin and impairing its polymerization, which consequently plays a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and scavenging of ROS, indirectly protecting cells from oxidative damage. Decreased levels of TB4 induce significant in- creases of ROS and disruption of the mitochondrial morphology in human colorectal carcinoma cells [37]. Quite the opposite, in- creased levels of TB4 promote stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1, whose expression is activated under hypoxia, a phe- nomenon that occurs during cancer progression, which eventu- ally increases the production of vascular endothelial growth fac- tor with consequent angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. In turn, it was proposed that Rho GTPases might be upstream regulators of TB4 [38,39], a fact that corroborates the direct correlation ob- served between TB4/RhoGDI2 expressed levels either in (a)- or (b)-treated cells (l \" Table 3). TB4 was also shown to downregulate inflammatory mediators like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and to increase production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [40]. Materials and Methods ! Compoundsʼ origin (22E,24R)-8,14-Epoxyergosta-4,22-diene-3,6-dione (a) was iso- lated from P. immersa and aphidicolin (b) from N. sphaerica as previously described [3,4]. Both are endophytic fungi from the plant Smallanthus sonchifolius (Yacon), Asteraceae. The purity of compounds (a) and (b) was assessed by GC and HPLC analyses as 98 and 99%, respectively.

Cell culture and preparation of lysates HL 60 (ATCC CCL-240) cells were cultured in 5 × 250 mL Falcon tissue culture flasks containing 40 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (triple 0.1 µm sterile-filtered, Gemini Bio-Products) and 1% of 100 u penicillin/ streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmo- sphere in a humidified incubator. After 10 days of culture, cells grew to a density of 1.4 × 106 cells per flask and were treated with the test substances for an additional 48 h using 0.7 µg/mL (1.65 µM) and 2.1 µg/mL (4.95 µM) of (a), and 0.15 µg/mL (0.4 µM) and 0.9 µg/mL (2.66 µM) of (b). A flask containing cells treated with 0.1% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a vehicle control. In order to obtain the lysates, the medium of each culture flask was transferred to a 50-mL conical Falcon tube and centri- fuged at 4°C/10 min/1200 rpm. The supernatants were decanted and cell pellets were washed 3 × 10 mL with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4 (without Ca or Mg; Lonza), followed by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.5 mL of modified RIPA lysis buffer by pi- petting up and down. The viscous content was ice incubated for 10 min, sonicated for 5 min, boiled for 5 min inside a beaker con- taining water, and extensively disrupted with 25 gauge needles. The resultant material was centrifuged at 4°C/30 min/12000 g. The obtained supernatants were collected, labeled “RIPA lysates”, and the total protein content was quantified with the BCA pro- tein assay according to the manufacturerʼs instructions (Thermo Scientific) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The residual pellets were submitted to a second lysis process us- ing 1.5 mL of urea/thiourea lysis buffer [5 M urea (EMD Chemi- cals, Inc.), 2 M thiourea (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mM DTT (Fisher Sci- entific), 0.1% SDS (Bio-Rad Labs), PBS, pH 7.4] and incubated for 30 min at r.t. followed by centrifugation at 15°C/30 min/ 20000 g. The obtained supernatants were collected, named “urea lysates”, and the total protein content was quantified by the Pierce 660 nm protein assay (Thermo Scientific) using BSA as the standard [41]. Growth inhibition Growth inhibition (GI) was assessed by the trypan blue dye ex- clusion method. For each tested compound, the GI was based on the concept of test through control (T/C), and the following equa- tion was used: GI = 100 – (T/C × 100) based on Richter et al. [42]. Control groups were treated with vehicle and doxorubicin (Dox- olem, Zodiac Produtos Farmacêuticos S/A, purity > 95%), the lat- ter of which was used as a positive control (IC50 0.02 µg/ mL = 0.4 nM). Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (ITRAQ) labeling and strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography Before being submitted to the isobaric labeling, the urea lysates had to be cleaned in order to remove excess urea to avoid modi- fications of proteins at temperatures above 37°C, rendering a protein unsuitable for enzymatic digestion [43]. Zeba desalting spin columns (Thermo Scientific) were previously conditioned with 4 × 1 mL PBS, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 2 min/r.t./ 1200 rpm. An aliquot of lysate corresponding to 100 µg of protein was speed-vacuum dried and resuspended in 1000 µL of PBS, pH 7.4. The obtained solution was split into five separate 200 µL aliquots in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes, followed by dilution of each to 700 µL with PBS, pH 7.4. Each of these was loaded into separate Zeba columns. After complete sample absorption, the tubes were centrifuged for 2 min/4°C/1200 rpm and the collected liquid was dried. The five samples were recombined by pipetting up and down 20 µL of dissolution buffer in the first tube, followed by vor- texing, spinning, and transfer to the second tube; the procedure was repeated until the fifth tube. Urea or RIPA lysates were reduced, alkylated, digested, and la- beled essentially as recommended by the iTRAQ 8-plex reagents manufacturerʼs protocol (Applied Biosystems), followed by a cleanup procedure using off-line SCX chromatography, which was carried out using polysulfoethyl A™macro spin columns 25–150 µL, (PolyLC, Inc.), previously conditioned using 1 × 500 µL MeOH (to activate the stationary phase; centrifuge the tube for 1 min/800 rpm), followed by 2 × 500 µL of 18 mOhm water (to prevent salt precipitation; centrifuge the tube for 1 min/800 rpm), and then 1 × 500 µL of 0.2 M monosodium phos- phate/0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 3.0 (span for 10 s/800 rpm, stood in the tube for 1 h). The stationary phase was equilibrated with 3 × 500 µL 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 3.0, in 20% ACN, then centrifuged for 1 min/800 rpm. Before loading, the sample was completely dried then resuspended in 200 µL of equilibration buffer. After loading, the column was centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 rpm, followed by washing with 2 × 100 µL of equilibration buffer, then centrifuged for 1 min/1000 rpm. Peptides were eluted from the stationary phase using 100 µL of the equilibra- tion buffer solutions containing 40 to 500 mM KCl (Sigma), re- spectively, and centrifuged for 1 min/1000 rpm. After elution, all samples were speed-vacuum dried and reconstituted in 16 µL of 2% ACN (HPLC grade; Mallinckrodt)/0.1% TFA (99+% spectropho- tometric grade; Sigma-Aldrich) in water (HPLC grade; Burdick & Jackson). Samples were stored at −20°C until LC‑MS analysis. LC‑MS analysis Peptide separation was performed on a Famos/Switchos/Ulti- mate™chromatography system (Dionex/LC Packings). Individual labeled-SCX aliquots (5 µL) were desalted for 10 min onto a C18 guard column (0.3 × 5 mm, 5 µm, 100 Å, LC Packings) using 2% ACN/0.1% TFA in water at 30 µL/min. Peptides were separated in a Dionex ProteoPep™C18 column (0.075 × 150 mm; 3 µm particle size, 100 Å) using solvent A (5% ACN/0.1% TFA in water) and sol- vent B (85% ACN/0.1% TFA/5% isopropyl alcohol in water) in a 160-min multistep gradient consisting of 10% solvent B for 40 min, followed by a 20-min linear gradient until 20% B, main- tained for 50 min, increased to 30% B in 20 min and maintained for 50 min, and finally a 10-min linear gradient until 100% B at a flow rate of 0.25 µL/min. The peptide elution was monitored at 214 and 280 nm. The outlet of the UV was coupled with a Probot MALDI-plate spotting device operating with Carrier software v. 1.47 (LC Packings). During separation, a saturated solution of 31.7 mM CHCA (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; Sigma) in 80% ACN/0.1% TFA in water containing 10 mM ammonium citrate dibasic (Fluka Analytical) and 25 fmol/µL of angiotensin II (AGT II, for internal calibration; Sigma) was continuously added to the eluant by the Probot system at a flow rate of 0.5 µL/min. Samples were spotted every 12.5 s of the LC run onto stainless steel MALDI plates (blank opti-TOF™LC/MALDI insert 123 × 81 mm, Applied Biosystems) totaling 768 spots (= LC fractions) per sample. Plates were stored in the dark until the MS and MS/MS spectra were ac- quired. For MALDI‑TOF‑MS and -MS/MS analyses, eight mass cal- ibration spots [0.75 µL of a solution containing 1 µL of a six-pro- tein mix (Applied Biosystems) stock solution (1:20) and 24 µL of saturated CHCA solution] were manually pipetted on the 8-pe- rimeter wells of the plate and dried at r.t. MALDI‑TOF‑MS data were acquired automatically over a mass range of 900 to 478 Gallo MBC et al.

MS and MS/MS data acquisition were controlled by 4000 series Explorer v 3.0 software. After plate alignment, external calibration, and in- ternal calibration for each MALDI plate, an MS spectrum was ac- quired for each of the 768 spots. The mass spectra were subjected to an interpretation method, which selected the 10 most intense precursors from each spot excluding ions with an S/N less than 20, filtering out identical peaks detected in adjacent spots with a mass tolerance of 200 ppm, an exclusion list tolerance of 0.1 m/z, and minimum chromatogram peak width of 2 fractions. MS/MS acquisition started from the strongest precursors first. The colli- sion induced dissociation (CID) used a collision cell floated at 2 kV and air as the collision gas; the relative precursor mass window was set at 300 FWHM (full width half mass) with suppression of the precursor ion and metastable ions unfocused; the spectra were acquired for the selected precursors using 3000 shots/spec- trum with 75 shots/sub-spectrum. The stop-condition criterion was determined to the 40 sub-spectra acquisition, passing or fail- ing. The internal one-point calibration utilized m/z of the mono- isotopic molecular ion of AGT II to match the minimum S/N of 200, a mass tolerance of ± 0.5 m/z, a mass error of 5 ppm, and a minimum peak width at 2.9 bins. When the acceptance criteria were not met, a default calibration based on a multi-parameter calibration equation was employed. Proteomics analysis Protein identification and quantitation for the ITRAQ experi- ments were performed with ProteinPilot v. 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) using the Paragon protein database search algo- rithm. The data analysis parameters were as follows: Sample type: iTRAQ 8-plex (peptide labeled); Cys alkylation: MMTS (methyl methanethiosulfonate); digestion: trypsin; instrument: 4800; special factors: none for RIPA lysates, and urea denatura- tion for urea lysates; ID Focus: biological modifications – searches for over 170 potential modifications. iTRAQ labeled lysine, iTRAQ N-terminal labeling, and MMTS alkylation of cysteine were used as fixed modifications; oxidation of methionine and iTRAQ label- ing of tyrosine were used as variable modifications. Database searching: ipi.HUMAN v.3.61; search effort: thorough ID; mini- mum detected protein threshold [unused ProtScore (conf)]: 99%. The relative quantification was based on the ratio of the re- porter ions corresponding to the urea or RIPA tryptic peptides from treated HL 60 cells over the reporter ion corresponding to the urea or RIPA tryptic peptides from the control. Proteins giving tryptic peptides with an average reporter ion ratio ≥2 were clas- sified as upregulated and those with an average reporter ion ratio ≤0.9 were classified as downregulated (p ≤0.05). Protein ontol- ogy was determined using the UniProtKB/Swiss Prot databank. Cell cycle arrest studies The assay involves the fixation and permeabilization of cells us- ing 70% ethanol, making the staining of DNA within intact cells by propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) possible. HL-60 cells were grown in 12 × 100 ml petri dishes; each plate contained 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% of 100 u penicillin/streptomycin, at 37°C under a 5% CO2 at- mosphere in a humidified incubator. When cells were confluent, they were treated with the vehicle (0.1% DMSO, negative con- trol), 95% S-(+)-camptothecin (10 µM, positive control; Sigma), or test compounds [0.15 and 0.9 µg/mL (b); 0.7 and 2.1 µg/mL (a)] for 48 h. Two independent experiments were carried out. Cel- lular DNA content was quantified by flow cytometric determina- tion of PI intercalated into DNA of intact, fixed cells. Drug- or ve- hicle-treated cells (1 × 106) were collected, twice washed with iced PBS, resuspended in PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol at −20°C for 48 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then treated with 1 mL of PI staining solution [20 µg/mL RNase A (Sig- ma) and 50 µg/mL PI as final concentrations] at 37°C for 30 min in the dark, and cells were stored in the dark at 4°C until analyzed (72 h). DNA content was determined on a BD LSRII special order system flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), equipped with a 488 nm Ar laser, by measuring forward and orthogonal light scatter, and peak and area red fluorescence. Acquisition of data was per- formed by FACSDiva software and analyzed by FlowJo software. Statistical analysis was performed by Studentʼs t-test using a sig- nificance level of p < 0.05. Apoptosis analysis Apoptosis assays were performed according to the manufac- turerʼs protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were cultured similarly to cell cycle analysis. Drug- or vehicle-treated cells (1 × 106) were collected, washed twice with iced PBS, and resuspended in 100 µL annexin-binding buffer (1:10 v/v in 18 mOhm water). Ali- quots of 5 µL of 7-aminoactinomycin D (1:20 v/v in PBS) and an- nexin V-pacific blue conjugate were added, and the sample was incubated at r.t. for 15 min in the dark. An amount of 400 µL an- nexin-binding buffer was added and gently agitated. Samples were maintained on ice until analyzed. The proportion of apo- ptotic cells was determined in a BD FACSAria analyzer (BD Bio- sciences) using a fluorescence excitation at 410 nm and an emis- sion at 455 nm. We considered aphidicolin as the positive control in this experi- ment since it is known to cause apoptosis in HL-60 cells at the tested dosages [8]. Electron microscopy HL-60 cells were cultured and treated in triplicate similarly to the lysates preparation method. Cells were harvested, twice washed with PBS pH 7.4, and then pelleted by low-speed centrifugation. The pellet was fixed with a solution containing 2.5% glutaralde- hyde (Sigma), 2.0% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), 0.1 M sodium ca- codylate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2.5 mM dihydro calcium chloride (Synth) in water for 72 h at 4°C. For scanning electron microsco- py, fixed cells were incubated at 37°C for 90 min on pretreated poly L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) slides. After being rinsed with iced 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, cells were post-fixed 1/1/(v/v) with 2% osmium tetroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in water plus 1.6% potassium ferricyanide (Sigma)-10 mM calcium chloride and 0.2 M sodium cacodylate for 15 min in the dark. After being in contact with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 2 min, the slides were washed three times with the same solution and dehydrated with an aqueous ethanol solution gradient, followed by CO2 critical-point drying using a Leica EM CPD030 apparatus. The specimens mounted on stubs were coated with gold, examined with a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6390LV, JEOL), and photographed. For trans- mission electron microscopy, the cells were fixed and post-fixed similarly to SEM, dehydrated in a graded acetone series, and em- bedded in Poly Bed 812 resin (Polysciences, Inc.). Ultrathin sec- tions were obtained, counterstained with 7% uranium acetate 479 Gallo MBC et al.

Western blotting Proteins were loaded at 20 µg/lane, electrophoresed on 8% SDS- polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% milk in PBS Tween, and immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal anti-TMSB4X (clone 4H7; Abnova), mouse monoclonal anti-STAT1 (clone 1A8; Abnova), mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin (T0198, Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal anti-gamma actin (F-3022, Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated over- night at r.t., followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Abcam) or HRP-conju- gated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG (Abcam) secondary anti- bodies at a dilution of 1:25000 for 1 h. The development was car- ried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amer- sham Pharmacia). Acknowledgements !

Introduction Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells that may affect almost any tissue of the body. Lung, colorectal and stomach cancer are among the most common in the world for both men and women. According to the World Health Organization cancer is responsible for 12% of the world’s mortality [1]. Plants have a long history of use in treatment of cancer and they have provided some of the currently used effective anticancer agents such as vinblastine, vincristine, etoposide, teniposide, and *Corresponding author.

The analysis of the sources of new and approved drugs for the treatment of cancer shows that 60% of these drugs were shown to be of natural origin, being natural compounds or derivatives thereof [3]. In vitro model system with human cells is increasingly used to investigate mechanism of chemical-induced toxicity and for toxicity screening of new drug families. Among the chemical entities assayed against cancer cell lines, acridone alkaloids have been a target of study by researchers. The acridone alkaloids are known to have several bioactivities, including antimalarial activity [4–6], antiviral [7,8], and cytotoxicity activity [9–11]. In this article, the isolation of 11 acridone alkaloids and three N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. and their in vitro cytotoxicity activity on several cancer cell lines are described. 2. Results and discussion The acridone alkaloids and N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives were isolated from the methanol extract of the stem and fresh fruits of Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr., respectively, and were identified on the basis of spectroscopic methods and comparison of literature data as: glycocitrine-IV (1) [12], 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy- 10-methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one (2) [13] and 1,3,5-trihydroxy- 2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone (3) [5], citbrasine (4) and citrusinine-II (5) [14], citrusinine-I (6) [15], 5-dihydroxyacronycine (7) [16], pyrano- foline (8) [17], dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl-2H-pyrano[2,3-a] acridin-12(7H)-one (9), 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxy-propan-2-yl)-11-meth- oxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-b]acridin-5(10H)-one (10) [13] and bis-5-hydroxyacronycine (11) [18], N-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (12), N-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethyl-4-acethyl-octa-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (13), and severine acetate (14) [19]. Swinglea is native to the Phillipine Islands but was introduced into Brazil where it grows well. Swinglea belongs to the Aurantioideae subfamily [20], and it is known to contain N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives and protolimonoids [19]. In the Aurantioideae, the relatively small representation of quinolones contrasts with a preferential accumulation of coumarins, acridones, amides, and flavonoids [21]. Thus, the range of compounds that were isolated from Swinglea reinforces its position as a member of the Aurantioideae. Natural and synthetic acridones represent important antitumor drugs. A character- istic example is the natural acridone acronycine (15), which posses an IC50 in leukemia cells in the order of 25 mM [22]. The structure–activity relationships (SAR) of a series of naturally occurring acridones have been studied to determine the effects of these compounds on the inhibition of cell growth and macromolecular biosynthesis of human promyelocytic leukemia cells [23]. Among 50 alkaloids tested, glyfoline (16) was found to be the most active compound (IC50 1.1 mM) and 21 alkaloids were found to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 mM), as compounds 6 (IC50 8.6 mM), 7 (IC50 8.8 mM), and 8 (IC50 7.1 mM). Further studies of glyfoline congeners by [24] revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the 1-hydroxy and the peri-carbonyl function of the 1-hydroxy-9-acridone nucleus was an important determinant for their cytotoxicity. Other 15 acridones were examined as inducers of HL-60 cell differentiation. These cells were differentiated into mature monocyte/macrophage by 48 P. A. C. Braga et al. Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013 atalaphyllidine (17), atalaphyllinine (18), and des-N-methylnoracronycine (19). The activities of NBT reduction (on a minimum of 200 cells), nonspecific esterase, and phagocytosis, were induced by 2.5 mM of 17–19. After a 4-day treatment, 17–19 at 10 mM inhibited clonal proliferation of HL-60 cells by 28, 96, and 63%, respectively. The SAR from the results revealed again that hydroxyl group at C-1 had an important role, as well as a prenyl group at C-2 of the tetracyclic acridones [9]. The same 15 acridones were examined for their antiproliferative effect on monolayers and suspension of several types of cancer cell lines, human lung carcinoma (A-549), melanin pigment- producing mouse melanoma (B-16 melanoma 4A5), T-cell leukemia (CCRF-HSB-2), gastric cancer cell, and lymph-node metastasized (TGBC11TKB) [10]. As a result, atalaphyllidine (17), atalaphyllinine (18), des-N-methylnoracronycine (19), and 5-hydroxy-N-methylseverifoline (20) showed potent antiproliferative activity against tumor cell lines. The SAR established from the results revealed that a secondary amine, hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-5, and a prenyl group at C-2 played an important role for antiproliferative activities of the tetracyclic acridones [23].

This stimulated us to test these alkaloids on other types of cancer cell lines, the human lung carcinoma cell line, Cytotoxicity activity of derivatives from S. glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. 49 Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013 COR-L23, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7, the human melanoma cell line, C32, and normal human fetal lung cell line, MRC-5. The sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay was used to test cytotoxicity against all cell lines and vinblastine sulfate (Sigma) was used as a positive control. The IC50 values of antitumor activity of the eleven acridone alkaloids and three N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives on COR-L23, MCF7, C-32, and MRC-5 are summarized in table 1. Unfortunately, in spite of their promising structural features, none of the acridone tested exhibited high level of cytotoxicity, with IC50 values ranging from 47.5 to 93.3 mM. In previous studies, di- and monoprenylate acridones were shown to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 mM) on human leukemic HL-60 cell. Examples are 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,4-bis(3-methyl- but-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone; with IC50 13.7 mM, and 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-(3-methyl- but-2-enyl)-5-methoxyl-10-methyl-9-acridone with (IC50 10.1 mM) [10]. However, acridone congeners 1–3 did not show significant activity on cancer cell lines COR- L23 (IC50: 14100, 2 66.1, 3 69.1 mM), MCF7 (IC50: 14100, 2 70.4, 34100 mM) and C32 (IC50: 14100, 2 70.1, 3 86.9 mM). In addition, what was particularly surprising in our study was the lack of appreciable activity for compounds 6–8 (COR-L23, IC50: 64100, 7 69.9, 84100 mM; MCF7, IC50: 64100, 7 77.6, 84100 mM, and C32, IC50: 64100, 7 83.9, 84100 mM) since they were found to be more active than acronycine on human leukemic HL-60 cells [10]. Examination of the preceding compilation and our data reveal some impediments to develop a qualitative understanding of structure–activity. Different investigators seldom utilize the same cancer cell lines and interspecific differences in the response of the test cells can easily mask any meaningful observation of SARs. The present results obtained from acridone alkaloids on cancer cell lines COR-L23, MCF7 and C-32 are reported here for the first time. Among the enormous variety of alkaloids Table 1.

Amides 13 (IC50 28.6 mM) and 14 (IC50 12.3 mM) were active against COR-L23 and only 14 (IC50 34.0 mM) against MCF7.

This is the first report of cytotoxic, activity of N-phenylethyl-benzamide, but their lack of selectivity precludes any clinical application. However, it is possible that analog could be developed that would show selectivity and these would be of greater interest as lead compounds.

HR-MS data were recorded at QTOF Micromass (QqTOF). Recycling HPLC Shimadzu SPD-6AV; TLC was carried out using Merck aluminum-backed silica gel 60 F254. 3.2. Plant material Leaves, stem, and root bark were collected in Campinas (SP), Brazil, at Instituto Agronoˆ mico de Campinas, and dried in the shade. The plant was identified by Prof. Dr Maira Ineˆ s Salgado. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of Universidade Federal de Sa˜ o Carlos (HUFSCar) number 7110 at Departamento de Botaˆ nica of Universidade Federal de Sa˜ o Carlos. 3.3. Isolation of compounds 3.3.1. Alkaloids. The parts of the plant were extracted separately with n-hexane at room temperature for 3 days, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure at 40C, this procedure was done three times to yield the hexane crude extract. The residue was extracted as the same way using MeOH to yield the n-hexane and methanol crude extract. The MeOH crude extract 60 g was fractioned by VCC over 1 kg of silica gel 60 (70–239 mesh, Merck) eluting with 1.5 L of the solvents: C6H14 100% (fraction 1), CH2Cl2 100% (fraction 2), CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 3 : 1 (fraction 3); CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 2 : 1 (fraction 4); CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 1 : 1 (fraction 4) and CH3OH 100% (fraction 5). Fractions 2 and 3 were combined after analyses with TLC. The result was chromatographed on silica gel eluted with CH2Cl2; the polarity was increased by addition of 5, 10, 13, 18, 20, and 25% of MeOH in a gradient system to yield 15 fractions. Lupeol was crystallized from the fractions 1–3. The fraction 5 was rechromatographed on Si gel eluted with n-hexane–acetone 1 : 3 and gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 60 4 cm2; MeOH) yield alkaloids 1 (3.5 mg), 2 (16.3 mg), 3 (30.4 mg), 4 (11.2 mg), 7 (9.8 mg), 8 (13.4 mg), and 11 (5.4 mg). Further purification of fraction 9 using gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 45 3 cm2; MeOH) followed by using of HPLC (column SHODEX ASAHIPAK GS-310 2G; flow rate at 3.0 mL min1; UV detection at 254 and 365 nm; MEOH as eluted) yield compounds 3 (7.3 mg), 5 (13.5 mg), and 6 (11.2 mg). Fraction 10 after rechromatographed on gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 30 3 cm2; MeOH) afforded compound 9 (4.3 mg) and 10 (5.2 mg). 52 P. A. C. Braga et al.

The extract was evaporated under vacuum and residue partitioned into CH2Cl2-, EtOAc- and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. Fractions CH2Cl2 and EtOAc were combined, solvent removed and the residue (26 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, elution with a hexane–CH2Cl2–EtOAc–MeOH gradient afforded 09 fractions. Fraction 2 was twice rechromatographed (silica gel, hexane– CH2Cl2 4 : 1; then silica gel, hexane–Me2CO 3 : 1) to give 12 and a fraction containing 13 and 14. The latter was rechromatographed as above, elution with hexane–EtOAc 7 : 1 yielded a mixture of 13 and 14. The latter was rechromatographed as described before, elution with hexane–EtOAc 7 : 1 and then by HPLC (column SHODEX ASAHIPAK GS-310 2G; flow rate at 3.0 mL min1; UV detection at 254 and 365 nm; eluted with CH2Cl2) affording compounds 13 (8 mg) and 14 (9 mg). 3.4. In vitro biological assays 3.4.1. Cell lines. Cancer cell lines used in this work were human lung carcinoma cell line, COR-L23, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7, the human melanoma cell line, C32 and normal human fetal lung cell line, MRC-5. The cells COR-L23, MCF7 and C32 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplement with 10% heated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% of 2 Mm L-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/ streptomycin. MRC-5 were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified minimum essential medium) with 10% FBS, 1% of 2 Mm L-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/ streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37C in a 5% CO2. According to their growth profiles, the follow densities of each cell were used: 1 103, 3 103, 3 103, and 2 103 cell/well for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5, respectively. 3.4.2. Preparation of cell suspension for assay. The human cell lines were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The PBS was decanted and cells detached with 2.5 mL of trypsin (Sigma) and PBS was added to a volume of 10 mL. The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation (37C, 115 r.p.m. and 5 min) was ressuspended in 10 mL of suitable medium to make a cell suspension. The cell density was counted by triplan exclusion in a hemocytometer and then diluted with medium to give the previously determined optimal densities for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5. The cell suspension (100 mL) from each cell were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37C to allow the attachment. After 24 h the cells were treated with the pure compounds solutions. Each pure compounds was initially dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) and after they were diluted in medium to produce four concentrations of 50, 5, 0.5, and 0.05 mg mL1. 3.4.3. Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay. The antiproliferative SRB assay was performed to assess growth inhibition by a colorimetric assay that estimates cell number indirectly by staining total cellular protein with the dye SRB [27]. Cells were fixed by layering 100 mL of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA, Aldrich Chemical) on top of grown medium. Cells were incubated at 4C for 1 h, after which plates were washed five times with water, the excess water drained off, and the plates left to dry in air at room temperature. SRB stain (50 mL; 0.4 in 1% acetic acid) (Sigma) was added to each well and left in contact with the cells for 30 min, after which they were washed with solution Cytotoxicity activity of derivatives from S. glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. 53 Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013 of 1% acetic acid and rinsed four times until only dye adhering to the cells was left. The plates were dried at room temperature and 100 mL of 10 mM Tris base pH 10.5 (Sigma) were added to each well to solubilize the dye. The plates were shaken gently for 2 min, and the absorbance of each well was read on a SLT 340 ATTC plate reader (SLT Labinstrument, Australia) at 492 nm. Cell survival was measured as the percentage absorbance compared to the control (nontreated cells). The IC50 values were calculated from the PRISM program obtained by plotting the percentage of survival versus the concentration and interpolated by cubic spine.

Two prenylated benzoic acid derivatives, one prenylated hydroquinone and two flavanones, were evaluated. The in vitro trypanocidal activity was determined against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (Y strain), the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. The most active compound was the prenylated hydroquinone [1,4-dihydroxy-2-(30,70- dimethyl-10-oxo-20-E,60-octadienyl)benzene] with an IC50 value of 6.10 mg mL1, which was in the same order of activity if compared with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 ¼ 1.60 mg mL1). This is the first report of trypanocidal activity for prenylated hydroquinone and benzoic acid derivatives.

Introduction American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In Latin and South America millions of people (estimated at 16–18 million in the decade of the 1990s) have been infected, and more than 25% of the population is at risk of being contaminated by the parasite (Grael, Albuquerque, & Lopes, 2005). However, over the last 15 years, prevalence estimates have been reduced, largely due to intensive large-scale programs designed to halt transmission by eliminating domestic populations of the insect vectors and to improve the screening of blood donors (Jannin & Villa, 2007). Nevertheless, transmission of Chagas disease is still a major health problem because of the transfusion of infected blood. Moreover, a recent case report in Brazil suggested the oral transmission of parasites, renewing the discussions about this problem (Pe´ rez-Gutie´ rrez, Agrelo Salvatella, & Figueroa, 2006). Currently available chemotherapy, based on nifurtimox and benznidazole, is accepted for treating acute infections, but it is unsatisfactory in the prevalent chronic stage because of limited efficacy, besides the *Corresponding author.

At present, the only trypanocidal compound used to prevent infection in blood banks is gentian violet, but it shows toxic effects and its use is limited (Rosas et al., 2007). The lack of effective medicines against acute and chronic infection is the critical reason to find more efficient and less toxic drugs than those currently used on the way to a cure for this pan-Latin-American disease. In spite of the great advances in modern medicine in recent decades, plants still make an important contribution to health care, providing chemical diversity and bioactivity, as well as to the development of hundreds of pharmaceutical drugs (Luize et al., 2006). Piperaceae family, belonging to the largest basal Angiosperm order, includes two rich genera, Piper (ca. 2000 species) and Peperomia (ca. 1500–1700 species) (Wanke et al., 2007). Several Piper species have been well studied, in which Piper nigrum produce piperine, the active pungent principle of black pepper; from P. hispidum, P. arboreum and P. tuberculatum were isolated antifungal and insecticide amides (Navickiene et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002). Additionally, chromenes and polyketides with significant antifungal activity have also been isolated from P. aduncum, P. hostmanianum, P. crassinervium and P. gaudichaudianum (Baldoqui et al., 1999; Danelutte, Lago, Young, & Kato, 2003; Kato & Furlan, 2007). Hydroquinones bearing prenyl moieties are natural products uncommon to land plants, but highly frequent in Piper species (Lago et al., 2004). Reported biological activities for such compounds include antitumoral (Danelutte et al., 2003), analgesic (De Pasquale, Circosta, Occhiuto, De Rosa, & De Stefano, 1991), antioxidant (Yamaguchi, Lago, Tanizaki, Di Mascio, & Kato, 2006) and antimicrobial (Lago et al., 2004). Prenylated benzoic acid derivatives were also isolated from Piper species, including P. crassinervium, and their bioactivity spectra are similar to prenylated hydroquinones. Here we report the evaluation of trypanocidal activity for five known compounds, 1 [4-hydroxy-(30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-octa-20-E-60-dienyl)benzoic acid] (Lago et al., 2004), 2 [4-hydroxy-3-(30,70-dimethyl-30-hydroxy-10-oxo-60-octenyl)benzoic acid] (Lago et al., 2004), 3 [1,4-dihydroxy-2-(30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20-E-60-octadienyl)benzene] (Danelutte et al., 2003), 4 isosakuranetin (5,7-dihydroxy-40-methoxyflavanone) (Agrawal & Bansal, 1989) and 5 sakuranetin (5,40-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone) (Agrawal & Bansal, 1989; Danelutte et al., 2003), (Table 1) isolated from leaves of P. crassinervium, as a part of our program devoted to discover new hits in the development of drugs for treatment of Chagas disease. This constitutes the first report of trypanocidal activity for prenylated hydroquinone and benzoic acid derivatives. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Plant material Leaves of P. crassinervium Kunth were collected in the region of Vale do Ribeira, Atlantic Forest (Sa˜ o Paulo State, Brazil) and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). A voucher specimen (KATO-0084) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botaˆ nica, Sa˜ o Paulo, SP, Brazil. 2.2. Extraction and isolation of the constituents Dried leaves (350 g) were extracted with EtOAc and concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The crude extract (20 g) was resuspended in MeOH : H2O (8 : 2) and partitioned Natural Product Research 1041 Downloaded by [New York University] at 11:11 09 June 2015 Table 1.

The hexane soluble portion (6.0 g) was fractioned using column chromatography over silica gel (70–230 mesh; Merck, column size 3.0 25 cm), which was eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 30%) to yield 11 fractions. Fraction 4 (0.284 g) was further separated by column chromatography over reversed phase ODS (Merck; C-18; 1.0 4.5 cm column) with MeOH–H2O (4 : 1) to yield eight fractions; the first fraction (0.221 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica gel (Merck; 230–400 mesh; 1.0 3.0 cm column) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 30%) to yield six fractions, the third fraction yielded compound 3 (0.023 g). Fraction 6 (0.015 g) was applied to a column chromatography over reversed phase ODS (Merck; C-18; 1.0 4.5 cm column) with MeOH–H2O (4 : 1) to yield compound 1 (0.011 g). The portion soluble in EtOAc (3.0 g) was fractioned by column chromatography over LH-20 (Merck, column size 3.0 100 cm) and eluted with MeOH to yield 16 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.050 g) was submitted to preparative TLC over silica gel (230–400 mesh; Merck), which was developed with hexane–acetone (6 : 4) to yield compound 2 (0.009 g). Fraction 11 (0.100 g) was chromatographed on preparative HPLC using hexyl-phenyl phase, which was eluted with MeOH–H2O (7 : 2), to yield 4 (0.030 g) and 5 (0.010 g). Compounds 1–5 were identified by comparison of their physical properties with literature values. 2.3. Trypanocidal assay The assays of the anti-parasitic activities of the isolates were conducted by screening their effects on the proliferation of epimastigote forms of T. cruzi Y-strain, grown in axenic culture in LIT medium. Stock solutions (containing 1.0 mg mL1) of all tested compounds were prepared in dimethylsulphoxide and serially diluted (1 : 3) in liver infusion tryptose medium to yield sample solutions with concentrations of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg mL1. All assays were conducted in triplicate. The number of remaining viable protozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber following incubation at 28C for 72 h with the test sample. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and statistical data were determined by using Probit analysis statistical method with GW-BASIC 2.33 (Microsoft Software, 1987). The IC50 values for compounds 1–5 and for benznidazole (employed as positive control) are shown in Table 1. 3. Results and discussion In this work, we have tested the inhibitory effects of five known compounds isolated from P. crassinervium against epimastigote forms of T. cruzi. Results are presented in Table 1. Three groups of molecules were tested here, two benzoic acid derivatives (1 and 2), one hydroquinone derivative (3), and two flavanones (4 and 5). Moreover, compounds 1–3 are C-geranylated molecules. The results showed that geranylated compounds were more active than the flavanones. Within the active compounds, the best activity was observed for 3 (IC50 value of 6.10 mg mL1) followed by geranylated p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives 1 and 2. The IC50 value observed for compound 3 [1,4-dihydroxy-2-(30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20- E-60-octadienyl)benzene], a p-hydroquinone derivative, represents an interesting hit Natural Product Research 1043 Downloaded by [New York University] at 11:11 09 June 2015 if compared with positive control benznidazole (IC50 value 1.6 mg mL1, Table 1). This molecule has two phenolic hydroxyl groups, one of them with a chelated function, which is also present at compounds 2 and 3. The change of one phenolic hydroxyl group (compound 3) by a carboxylic acid one (compound 1) produced a loss of activity greater than 50% (IC50 value from 6.1 to 16.3 mg mL1, Table 1), suggesting its crucial role in trypanocidal activity. This observation is in agreement with Luize, P.S. et al., who proposed that the loss of the hydroxyl group in neolignans isolated from P. regnellii resulted in the complete loss of activity against epimastigote forms of T. cruzi (Luize et al., 2006). In addition, the phenolic hydroxyl group present in the active molecule is apparently able, through hydrogen-bond links with the specific molecules on the cell surface, to inactivate essential metabolic pathways within the parasite (Patrick, 1995). The decrease in the activity observed for compound 2 (IC50 value 15.8 mg mL1, Table 1), is also in agreement. Isosakuranetin (4) and sakuranetin (5) (Agrawal & Bansal, 1989; Danelutte et al., 2003), showed weak antichagasic activity with IC50 values of 119.6 and 111.7 mg mL1, respectively (Table 1). Several types of flavonoids have been identified as antiprotozoal principles of plant extracts (Camacho et al., 2002; Grael et al., 2005; Jorda˜ o, Vichnewski, Souza, Albuquerque, & Lopes, 2004). However, there are few reports about the activity of flavonoids against epimastigotes of T. cruzi. Our results are in agreement with such observations, suggesting that the molecular topology is very important for adequate interactions at receptor level to exert trypanocidal effect. Flavanone skeleton was less active than geranylated hydroquinone derivatives, even with phenolic hydroxyl groups in the molecule. The presence of lipophilic geranyl moiety oxygenated in benzylic position, in compounds 1–3 could be important to trypanocidal activity; this fact was also considered crucial to exert antioxidant activity, because of their better insertion into lipophilic surfaces (Kato & Furlan, 2007). Several studies were reported about the antileishmaniasic activity of natural hydroquinone and related structures, however there are few results concerning their antichagasic potential. In this context, a prenylated dihydroquinone isolated from Peperomia galioides (Piperaceae) displayed a promising toxicity against Leishmania brasiliensis, L. donovani and L. amazonensis, but it was inactive on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (Mahiou et al., 1995; Mahiou et al., 1996). The present investigation revealed that 3-geranylated hydroquinone and benzoic acid derivatives, isolated from leaves of P. crassinervium, showed potent trypanocidal activity. More extensive and detailed studies on the trypanocidal activity of natural and synthetic geranylated derivatives from Piperaceae species will be the target of future studies focusing on the understanding of the structural requirements of this group of natural products. Also, in vitro and in vivo unspecific toxicity should be investigated in order to evaluate their potential as new leader structures for the development of antichagasic drugs.

The in vitro anti-allergic activity was investigated by -hexosaminidase release assay in rat basophilic leukaemia RBL-2H3 cells. The -lactam derivative exhibited similar anti-allergic activity (IC50 ¼ 18.7 6.7 mM) in comparison with ketotifen fumarate (IC50 ¼ 15.0 1.3 mM) and stronger anti-allergic activity than azelastine (IC50 ¼ 32.0 mM). Also, the MTT cytotoxicity assay with RBL-2H3 cells showed that -lactam does not display cytotoxicity at concentrations lower than 50 mM. This study suggests that the -lactam derivative has the potential to be used as a lead compound in the development of anti-allergic drugs for clinical use in humans. Keywords: Humicola grisea var thermoidea; thermophylic fungus; -lactam derivative; in silico; anti-allergic activity 1. Introduction Currently, important fungal metabolites are successfully employed in the clinical setting, including -lactams, the anti-hypercholesterolaemic drug lovastatin and its derivatives, the immunosuppressant cyclosporin and ergotamine. Pharmaceutical and medical aspects of these valuable drugs have been comprehensively reviewed (Misiek and Hoffmeister, 2007). The Humicola genus includes several species of thermophilic soil fungi that are able to degrade complex natural substrates. Furthermore, Humicola grisea var thermoidea is an important producer of thermostable enzymes that have a wide application in biotechno- logical studies (Dantas-Barbosa, Arau´ jo, Moraes, Vainstein, & Azevedo, 1998). As part of our continuous investigation of new metabolites from fungi, we recently analysed an ethyl acetate culture extract of H. grisea and isolated a -lactam derivative in a pure form by a combination of repeated column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. *Corresponding author.

Results and discussion The complete structural assignment of the -lactam derivative (Figure 1) was accomplished by spectral analysis. The 1H-NMR spectral data were compared with previously published data (Gopichand and Schmitz, 1979), which confirmed our structure assignments. The 1H-NMR spectrum displays a pair of two-hydrogen doublets at 6.88 and 7.96 (1H, d, J ¼ 8.9 Hz), respectively, characterising four hydrogens in ortho positions in the p-substituted aromatic system. In addition to the aromatic hydrogen signals, the triplet at 6.61 (1H, t, J ¼ 4.2 Hz), attributable to the hydrogen of an ,-unsaturated carbonyl system, is compatible with the presence of one vinyl hydrogen. This hydrogen is coupled to a broad two-hydrogen multiplet at 2.44 (2H, m), which in turn is coupled with a two- hydrogen triplet appearing at 3.45 (2H, t, J ¼ 7.3 Hz). Irradiation of the signal at 2.44 not only collapses the triplets at 6.61 and 3.45, but also sharpens a broad two-hydrogen singlet at 3.93 (2H, bs). These hydrogen signals correspond to the -lactam ring. The 13C-NMR (CD3OD) spectrum contains 13 carbon atoms signals. Among the quaternary carbons, one is attributed to the amide carbonyl ( 168.4, C-1), a second described to ketone carbonyl ( 198.6, C-8) and the third quaternary carbon linked to a hydroxyl group ( 164.0, C-40). These data have allowed us to propose a -lactam moiety for the compound, in addition to the p-hydroxybenzoyl moiety, which was corroborated by the H–C correlations observed in the HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) experiment. The union of a -lactam moiety with that of the p-hydroxybenzoyl moiety was confirmed by HMBC correlations of the hydrogens at 7.96 and 3.93 with the carbon at 198.6. The mass spectrum (MS) with m/z ¼ 232.0980 [M þ H]þ suggested the molecular formula C13H13NO3 and the optical rotation measurements resulted in ½27 D –7.4 (c ¼ 1.0, MeOH). All these results are in agreement with the structure (Figure 1) proposed for the isolated compound. The -lactam derivative (3-(2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl)-5,6-dihydropyr- idin-2(1H)-one) was first isolated from an algae-infested Caribbean sponge, Halichondria melanodocia, and its structure was elucidated on the basis of 1H-NMR and MS data only (Gopichand and Schmitz, 1979). This is the first time that the above-mentioned -lactam derivative has been isolated from fungi culture and identified by 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMQC (heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation) and HMBC analysis, high resolu- tion mass spectrometry and optical rotation.

Natural Product Research 2169 Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 20:05 20 January 2015 The use of in silico predictions is an important tool in the development of new drugs. In this regard, in silico prediction performed with PASS (prediction of activity spectra of substances) for the -lactam derivative indicated several possible biological activities, and among them the anti-allergic one (Table 1). Therefore, it was decided to undertake in vitro anti-allergic assays using three protocols to confirm the prediction. Despite the use of different approaches in drug discovery, natural products still provide new templates for clinical assays (Butler, 2004), including new anti-allergic drugs. In anti- allergic activity studies, -hexosaminidase (-hex) release is an effective method for monitoring different responses of mast cells such as exocytose signal transduction, biological activity of new drugs and antigen detection (Naal, Tabb, Holowka, & Baird, 2004). The amount of -hex increases significantly when a drug either stimulates cells or causes cell death (Schwartz, Austen, & Wasserman, 1979). Thus, the -hex enzyme assay is a highly appropriate tool to assess the potentiality of drugs to inhibit mast cell degranulation. The -hex release assay demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of the -lactam derivative on mast cell degranulation is dose dependent (IC50 ¼ 18.7 6.7 mM) (Figure 2a) and possesses a similar activity compared with ketotifen fumarate (IC50 ¼ 15.0 1.3 mM) (Figure 2b) and a stronger anti-allergic activity than azelastine (32.0 mM) (Lee et al., 2007), Figure 2.

Andrioli et al. Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 20:05 20 January 2015 both used as reference drugs in this study. Azelastine and ketotifen have been recently classified as multiple action drugs, suggested to combine antihistaminic, mast cell stabilisation and anti-inflammatory effects (Lambiase, Micera, & Bonini, 2009). The mechanism(s) by which both drugs inhibit mast cell activation remain unclear but one suspected mechanism is the blocking of IgE-regulated calcium channels, stabilising the cell and preventing the release of histamine and related mediators (Lambiase et al., 2009; Williams, Crandall, & Sheppard, 2010). In addition, inhibition of intracellular Ca2þ elevation levels leads to the inhibition of Ca2þ-dependent PKC, which is also critical for granule exocytosis (Kimata, Shichijo, & Miura, 1999). The effects of the -lactam derivative on the activity of -hex were also examined to clarify whether its effect was due to inhibition of enzyme activity or degranulation. As shown in Figure 3(b), the active compound weakly inhibits the enzyme activity of -hex, since 50 mM of the -lactam derivative causes only 44% enzyme inhibition, demonstrating that the reduction on quantified -hex, in the presence of the -lactam derivative, is mostly attributable to the capacity of the compound to inhibit the secretion of -hex from the RBL cells. Furthermore, the incubation of RBL-2H3 cells, in the presence of the -lactam derivative (0.02–50 mM), for 24 h did not affect the cell viability, assessed using the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay. As shown in Figure 3(a), only a small reduction in cell viability (15%) was observed after cell treatment with the highest drug concentration (50 mM). The inhibitory activity of the -lactam derivative against mast cell degranulation indicate that it is a promising candidate for the development of anti-allergic agent with the required action mechanism. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxic concentration against RBL-2H3 cells was much higher than the effective (in vitro) anti-allergic ones. Therefore, the -lactam derivative seems to be safe for future applications, but additional studies to certify both the acute and chronic toxicities of this compound are necessary. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker; Karlsruhe, Germany) with TMS as an internal standard. Figure 3. (a) Cytotoxicity of the -lactam derivative on RBL-2H3 cells determined by MTT assay. The percentage of cell viability was calculated relative to the untreated control. The cells (1.0 105 cells mL1) were incubated with the -lactam derivative in 5% CO2 for 24 h, at 37C. (b) Effects of the -lactam derivative on -hex enzyme activity. Inhibition levels at 18 mM (IC50) and 50 mM Qc were equal to 28 and 44%, respectively, indicating that the activity of the -lactam derivative is mainly due to its ability to inhibit degranulation. Natural Product Research 2171 Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 20:05 20 January 2015 MS analyses were performed at high resolution on an ultrOTOFq–ESI–TOF Mass Spectrometer Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA, EUA). The MS analysis was accomplished using collision energy of 25 eV. Optical rotation analysis was undertaken on a Jasco Digital Polarimeter – DIP 370. HPLC chromatography was carried on a Shimadzu equipment (SCL-10Avp, LC-10AD and SPD-M10Avp DAD, Japan) using reverse phase column CLC–ODS (M) – 4.6 250 mm2 Shimadzu. CC was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 and 60 H (Merck; Darmstadt, Germany). Precoated plates of silica gel 60 F254 (Merck; Darmstadt, Germany) were used for analytical purposes and the spots were detected with a UV lamp at 254 and 366 nm and by spraying with 50% H2SO4 followed by heating. 3.2. Cultivation, extraction and isolation The Humicola strain was isolated from a Brazilian soil sample (Minas Gerais, Brazil) and classified as H. grisea var. thermoidea on the basis of morphological and physiological characteristics as described by Cooney and Emerson (1964). The isolated strain is deposited at the Laboratory of Microbiology and Cellular Biology, University of Sa˜ o Paulo. The production of secondary metabolites was carried out by inoculation of rice medium (90 g) with 4 104 conidia g1. Cultures (40 flasks) were incubated for 90 days at 40C. The metabolites were extracted through maceration with ethanol. The ethanol extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum, furnishing the crude ethanol extract (16.0 g), which was partitioned with hexanes and ethyl acetate, in sequence. This procedure afforded 6.2 and 4.0 g of each fraction, respectively. The ethyl acetate fraction was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel 60H and eluted with a mixture of hexanes–EtOAc in the order of increasing polarity (0–100%) to yield a total of eight fractions. The fifth subfraction (439 mg) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography and eluted with a mixture of hexanes–EtOAc in the order of increasing polarity (0–100%) to yield a total of eight fractions. The third subfraction (154 mg) was flash-chromatographed over silica gel 60, using an isocratic mobile phase (hexanes/ethyl acetate/methanol 25:69:6), which gave 46 fractions. Fractions 10–21 were combined (77 mg) and analysed by HPLC. Multiple injections of combined fractions obtained from flash chromatography onto a reverse phase column CLC–ODS (M) – 4.6 250 mm2 Shimadzu was carried out, and elution was accomplished with methanol/water (10:90 to 100%) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min1 over 23 min, thereby yielding the -lactam derivative (10 mg). 3-(2-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl)-5,6-dihydropyridin-2(1H)-one (-lactam deriva- tive) (1): white solid, m.p. 235.0–235.5C, UV (MeOH): max (log \") ¼ 218 (4.13) and 273 (3.77) nm; IR (KBr): max ¼ 3377, 3200, 1680 and 1635/cm; 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) 2.44 (m, 2H, CH2), 3,45 (t, J ¼ 7.3 Hz, 2H, CH2), 3.93 (bs, 2H, CH2), 6.61 (t, J ¼ 4.2 Hz, H, CH), 6.88 (d, J ¼ 8.9 Hz, 2H, 2xCH) and 7.96 (d, J ¼ 8.9 Hz, 2H, 2xCH); 13C-NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD): 25.2 (C-4), 40.4 (C-7), 40.6 (C-3), 116.3 (C-20, 60), 129.8 (C-10), 131.0 (C-6), 132.0 (C-30,50), 141.0 (C-5), 164.0 (C-40), 168.4 (C-1) and 198.6 (C-8); HREIMS: m/z 232.0980 [M þ H]þ (calcd for C13H13NO3: 232.0974). 3.3. Molecular modelling procedures and prediction of the biological activity spectrum Conformational search was performed on the -lactam structure by means of the systematic searching method using the Merck molecular force field molecular mechanics model, implemented in the Spartan 06 1.0.2 software (Spartan, 2006). The molecule was then fully optimised in the gas phase at the B3LYP/6-31 G* level of calculation. 2172 W.J. Andrioli et al. Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 20:05 20 January 2015 The prediction of the possible biological activity spectrum was performed with the PASS server. PASS is a tool that predicts the possible biological effects of a compound on the basis of the structural formula using MNA (Multilevel neighbourhoods of atoms) descriptors, thus suggesting that the biological activity is a function of the chemical structure. The PASS algorithm method estimates the biological activity by comparing the structure of a new compound with a training set of approximately 46,000 well-known bioactive compounds. Only the activities with Pa higher than 0.7 predicted for the -lactam compound were considered. 3.4. Anti-allergic assay 3.4.1. b-hex release assay RBL-2H3 cells (Barsumian, Isersky, Petrino, & Siraganian, 1981) were maintained and harvested as previously described (Naal et al., 2004). They were sensitised overnight with a five-fold excess of anti-DNP-IgE (Liu et al., 1980) at 37C and washed twice in Tyrode’s buffer containing 1 mg mL1 BSA (Acros Organics, NJ, USA). The -hex release assay was performed as described by Naal et al. (2004). IgE sensitised cells (1.5 105 cells mL1) attached to microlitre wells were treated with 100 mL of each concentration (0.02–50.0 mM) of the -lactam derivative prepared in Tyrode’s buffer (from 1.0 mg/mL stock solution in DMSO), followed by the addition of 100 mL of the antigen (final concentration equal to 0.1 mg mL1) at 37C, for 60 min. Finally, 100 mL of -hex substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl--D-glucosaminide (Sigma–Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) (final concentration equal to 1.2 mM), prepared in Tyrode’s buffer, was added and the cells were incubated for 30 min, at 37C. The reaction was stopped by placing the cells on ice. -Hex activity was assessed by the measurement of its fluorescent product, umbelliferone, in a microplate reader (BioTek, Synergy HT, Winooski, VT, USA) at 360 nm excitation and 450 nm emission filters. The percentage of released -hex was calculated using Equation (1) and was based on the total amount of released -hex from cells disrupted with the surfactant Triton X-100. Spontaneous -hex release was determined from cells in Tyrode’s buffer in the absence of antigen stimulation. IC50 values were determined graphically. The inhibitory effect of the -lactam derivative on -hex secretion was compared with that of ketotifen fumarate (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). % -Hexosaminidase ¼ S N T N 100 ð1Þ where S is the sample – fluorescence regarding released -hex from (þ) or () DNP-BSA treated cells, N normal – fluorescence from vehicle (Tyrode’s buffer) and T total – fluorescence regarding released -hex from Triton X-100 disrupted cells. 3.4.2. b-hex inhibitory activity An assay was performed in order to ensure that the anti-allergic activity of the -lactam was due to the inhibition of -hex release and not the -hex activity. To this end, the cell suspension (1.5 105 cells mL1) was sonicated and centrifuged. The enzyme solution (45 mL) and test sample solution (5 mL) were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated with 50 mL of the substrate solution for 1 h, at 37C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 mL of stop solution (0.1 M Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 10.0) and fluorescence was measured using the microplate reader. Natural Product Research 2173 Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 20:05 20 January 2015 3.4.3. MTT assay RBL-2H3 cells (2.0 104 cell per well) were seeded onto 96 well plates and incubated overnight. The medium was then removed and fresh medium, along with different tested concentrations of the -lactam derivative (0.02–50.0 mM), were added to cultures in parallel. After 24 h of incubation, an MTT assay was performed using the modified method of Mosmann (1983). For instance, following the 24 h incubation, the cells were washed and added to 20 mL of MTT (5 mg/mL) and 180 mL culture medium, with an additional 4 h incubation at 37C. Later on, the supernatant was dumped out and the formed insoluble formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO and their optical densities were measured at 570 using a microplate reader. The optical density from the lactam derivative untreated cells was used as an indicator of 100% cell viability. The MTT assay assesses cell viability by measuring the activity of mitochondrial reductases to reduce the MTT salt into formazan, a process that only occurs for viable cells (Mosmann, 1983). 3.5. Statistical analysis Results for -hex release were expressed as means SEM. The concentration of the tested compound that caused 50% of -hex inhibition (IC50) was obtained using the Origin 8.0 software. One-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnet’s test was used for statistical analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant at p 5 0.05. 4. Conclusions The results of the bioassay evaluations obtained in this study confirmed the anti-allergic potential of the -lactam derivative predicted by the computational studies. Thus, the combination of molecular structure determination and computational predictions is a helpful and important tool for drug development. Our findings also provide new perspectives about the therapeutic use of -lactam as an anti-allergic drug. In addition, this study reinforces the importance of studying metabolites from microorganisms in the search for lead compounds.

Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene isolated from the ethanolic leaf extract of C.sylvestris. The aim of the study was to assess the capacity of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris leaves and caseargrewiin F to protect DNA and verify if both the compounds cause some DNA damage, using the micronu- cleus (MN) test and comet assay in mice. Balb-C mice were treated with the extract [3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)] and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 14 days. On day 15, DNA damage was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of cyclophosphamide (CP) (i.p.) at 50 mg/kg b.w. after the MN test and comet assay were performed. A protective effect of ethanolic extract was observed in MN test (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg b.w.) and the comet assay (3.13 and 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F showed protective effect at 0.63, 1.3 and 2.5 mg/kg b.w. only in comet assay. We also tested the ability of compounds of C.sylvestris to induce MN and to increase the comet assay tail moment. The experimental design was similar to the DNA protection assay except that in test groups we omitted the CP challenge. We observed increased damage at 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F at 3.18 mg/kg b.w. in both the MN test and comet assay. We conclude that ethanolic extract of C. sylvestris and case- argrewiin F can protect cells against DNA damage induced by CP at low concentrations, but at high concentrations these compounds also induce DNA damage. Introduction Medicinal herbs have long been used in medical treatment and are still the sole remedy against several diseases in many parts of the world (1). Also, many natural products present in fruits, beverages and vegetables may be regarded as protective or even anti-proliferation agents for several types of human cancer (2). Some Brazilian natural products, including those that are isolated from Casearia sylvestris, are used in folk medicine, despite their potential toxicity. C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) (3) is a tree widely distributed in Brazil, from Amapa´ in the north down to Rio Grande do Sul and it is found in a variety of ecosystems from the savannah-like the Cerrado to the tropical Atlantic Rain forest and the equatorial Amazon forest. Moreover, it has also been found in Mexico and the Antilles (4). Casearia sylvestris is commonly known as ‘guacxatonga’ and used widely for its anti-inﬂammatory and anti-ulcerative activities (4–6) as well as its cytotoxic activity against malignant tumour cells (7). In addition, the bark of C.sylvestris has been used against fever and for treatment of herpes virus and diarrhoea (8). Phytochemical investigations revealed that the major compounds isolated from C.sylvestris exhibited both cytotoxic and anti-fungal activities (7). Caseargrewiin F is a clerodane diterpene, found in plants of the Casearia genus, described as a colourless and amorphous solid (9). While caseargrewiin F was not shown to be cytotoxic to human epidermoid carcinoma in the mouth, it exhibited cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and human small cell lung cancer. In the present study, caseargrewiin F was isolated from the leaves of C.sylvestris. In order to complement the studies of biological activity of compounds isolated from C.sylvestris, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the ethanolic extract of leaves of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protect cells against DNA-induced damage or induce DNA damage by theirselves, using the micronucleus (MN) test and comet assay in Balb- C mice. Materials and methods Plant material and preparation of extract Leaves of C.sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) were collected at the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (Sa˜o Miguel Arcanjo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in March and July 2004. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herbarium ‘Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann’ (Instituto Botaˆnico do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) with the reference numbers AGS04, AGS05, AGS06, AGS13 and AGS19. The plant material was identiﬁed by Dr Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil). Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris (20.5 kg) were extracted with ethanol (ca. 200 litre) in a stainless steel extractor with solvent re-circulation for ca. 24 h at 40C. The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure (rotaevaporator) and dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure to yield 1.5 kg of dry residue. Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The identiﬁcation of compounds in ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was carried out in Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, by Andre Gonzaga dos Santos. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The sample was dried in a desiccator over silica gel under reduced pressure, dissolved in 4.0 ml of methanol and ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a high performance liquid chroma- tography (HPLC) vial. The reference standard used in this work—caseargrewiin F and casearin U—was puriﬁed and identiﬁed in the laboratories of Nu´cleo de Bioensaios, Biossı´ntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Chemistry Institute, Sa˜o Paulo State University, Araraquara, Brazil; for details see Santos et al. (10). The standard solutions were prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of caseargrewiin F into a volumetric ﬂask. After diluting with methanol, the standard solutions (0.0079, 0.0159, 0.0635, 0.2540 e 0.5080 mg/ml) were ﬁltered through 0.22 lm membrane ﬁlter (PVDF Millipore) into a HPLC vial before injections. Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Varian ProStar system (comprising a model 240 pump, a 410 autosampler and a 330 photodiode array detector), with control and data handling managed by Star Chromatography software. Analysis was conducted using a Phenom- enex Gemini C-18 column (250 4.6 mm, 5 lm) eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile: methanol: water (from 44:22:34 to 47:53:00, v/v/v, in 42 min) and acetonitrile: methanol (53:47, v/v, in 5 min); ﬂow rate 0.8 ml/min; detection range 210–400 nm; injection volume 20 ll. Analysis was realized in triplicate. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis A 5.0 mg of dried extract was submitted to SPE (2 1 cm) from silica gel (60– 200 lm; Merck): activated charcoal (Synth) (1:1, w/w) eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate (95:05, v/v, 5.0 ml). The sample was dried and diluted in hexane to afford 1.0 mg/ml solution. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 gas chromatograph with ﬂame ionization detector using a DB-5 column (30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 lm). The carrier gas was He at a ﬂow rate of 1.33 ml/min, split mode with ratio of 1:20 and injection volume of 1 ll. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 250C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed from 60C, with an increase of 3C/min, to 240C. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis analysis was conducted using the same system and conditions interfaced to a mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an ion trap detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. The compounds were identiﬁed by their retention indexes, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a series of n-alkanes (11) and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of Wiley 7.0 library and of the literature (11). Compound concentrations were calculated from the GC peak areas. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis Dried extract was diluted in CDCl3 (50.0 mg/ml) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA 500 11.4 T instrument with CHCl3 as internal standard. Ethanolic extract emulsions The ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was dissolved in Tween 20 (20%). Balb-C male mice were treated with 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. The concentrations of the test were chosen based on the high solubility of the ethanolic extract in the Tween 20 (20%). Puriﬁcation and structure determination of caseargrewiin F Dried and powdered leaves of C.sylvestris were extracted by steeping in ethanol. The dried extract obtained was separated by SPE on silica gel: activated charcoal and fraction SPE2 was separated further by normal-phase low-pressure column chromatography (CC) on silica gel. Fractions CC15-19 were puriﬁed by preparative reversed-phase (C18) HPLC to yield caseargrewiin F (850.0 mg). The structure of the compound was determined from spectrometric data (nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry) and by comparison with spectral information available in the literature. For details see Santos et al. (10). The chromatographic purity of the caseargrewiin F in the assays used was 98.6% (HPLC-UV detected at 235 nm). Caseargrewiin F emulsions Caseargrewiin F (Figure 1) was emulsiﬁed in 6% Tween 80 for both assays in mice. The Balb-C male mice were treated with 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg of caseargrewiin F per kg body weight (b.w.). These concentrations were based on ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris in which doses of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w. were used; since caseargrewiin F represents 4% of the ethanolic extract, we selected doses that are 4% of the ethanolic extract doses. Animals Six-week-old Balb-C male mice were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (22 2C) and humidity (55 10% room humidity), in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized for 1 week, during which they had free access to a commercial diet (Purina) and water. The study was conduced with approval of Brazilian Ethics Commitee to Experimentation Animals (process CEP/FCF/CAr n 01/2006). Mutagenic chemical–Positive control Cyclophosphamide (CP, Sigma–Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, Lot. No. 036K1225, purity 99%) was used as mutagenic agent in experiments. CP was diluted in 0.9% NaCl just before use and the animals were exposed to the chemical by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg b.w. in 0.3 ml. Mutagenicity—MN test Experimental design The assays were performed using eight animals/group. Group 1 (negative control) mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection of 0.3 ml. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and was treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%), 0.6 ml by gavage, for 2 weeks and on day 15 the mice were injected i.p. with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl. Groups 4–9 were treated for 2 weeks by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with various concentrations of ethanolic extract (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) or caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.). These groups also received treatment with 0.3 ml 0.9% NaCl by i.p on day 15. Bone marrow from each animal was collected 24 h after the last administration (12). The bone marrow MN test was carried out as described by Schmid (13). All slides were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa and coded to avoid observer bias. For each experimental point, 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were scored to determine the percentages of micronucleated PCE. The ratio of PCEs to normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) (PCEs/NCEs) was determined in 200 cells. Genotoxicity—comet assay For the comet assay, the experimental design was the same as for the MN test in mice. Peripheral blood was collected in heparinized capillary vials and kept on ice until use. The alkaline version of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) was performed as described by Singh (14). Brieﬂy, 20 ll of blood was taken, homogenized with low-melting point agarose, spread on microscope slide pre-coated with normal melting point agarose and covered with a coverslip. After 5 min at 4C, the coverslip was removed from slides and they were immersed in cold lysing solution (2.4 M NaCl; 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); 10 mM Tris, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 1% Triton-X, pH 10) for 24 h. After lysis, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber, covered with electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH plus 1 mM EDTA, pH .13) and left for 20 min for the DNA to unwind. The electrophoresis was run for 20 min (25 V and 300 mA), after which the slides were submerged for 15 min in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) and ﬁxed in 96% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were prepared in duplicate with ethidium bromide and 50 cells were screened per sample in a ﬂuorescent microscope (ZEISS, Germany) equipped with an excitation ﬁlter of 515–560 nm, a barrier ﬁlter of 590 nm and a 40 objective. The level of Fig. 1. Chemical structure of caseargrewiin F. A. M. de Oliveira et al. 502 DNA damage was assessed by an image analysis system (TriTek CometScore 1.5, 2006) and the percentage of DNA in tail was obtained. Antimutagenicity—MN test Experimental design In Group 1 (negative control), mice received only drinking water (0.6 ml per day by gavage) for 2 weeks before treatment with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection. Group 2 (positive control) also received drinking water for 2 weeks and were treated on day 15 with CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.). Group 3 was treated with 0.6 ml Tween 20 (20%) or Tween 80 (6%) by gavage, for 2 weeks, and on day 15 received CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p.); the aim of this group is to ensure that Tween has no inﬂuence in possible DNA protective effect. Groups 4–9 were treated by gavage (0.6 ml per day per animal) with solutions of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris (3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.) and caseargrewiin F (0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 mg/kg b.w.) for 2 weeks and, on day 15, CP (50 mg/kg b.w., i.p) was administered. Bone marrow was taken 24 h of CP after the injection (12). The MN test was performed as described previously for the mutagenicity assays. Antigenotoxicity—comet assay The experimental design for the Comet assay was the same as for antimutagenicity MN test and the comet assay for antigenotoxicity was carried out as described for the genotoxicity assay. Recently, Collins et al. (15) described that when comet assay is performed in in vivo experiments low concentrations of genotoxic agents are unlikely to induce signiﬁcant cytotoxicity, they also afﬁrm that a low comet assay DNA damage would be a better indicator that cells are alive than common cytotoxicity tests. In this context, to the comet assay we did not performed cytotoxicity test once at low concentrations, the compounds were not genotoxic and consequently did not present cytotoxicity that could inﬂuence in antigenotoxicity assay. Statistical analysis For a statistical interpretation, results were analyzed with Sigma Stat 3.5, Systat, CA. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to test data for normal distribution, in all assays performed in the study. Since the results did not a show normal distribution, non-parametric tests were applied. In mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays, the Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare DNA damage with the negative control. In the MN tests, the PCE/NCE ratio was evaluated with the Kruskal–Wallis test. In antimutagenicity/antigenotoxicity assays, Mann– Whitney U test was used to compare all groups tested with the Tween 20 (20%) plus CP group, to assess the decrease in DNA damage. To test whether any groups demonstrated signiﬁcant reduction in DNA damage to basal levels, those groups were also compared with negative control by the Mann–Whitney U test. Results Identiﬁcation of compounds in the extract The 1H NMR spectrum from extract showed signals with absorptions in d 1.98–2.09, 2.20–2.40, 3.43, 5.07–5.45, 6.25– 6.75, similar to those described for casearins and other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C.sylvestris (10,16–18). Both casearin U and caseargrewiin F were identiﬁed in the extract. However, casearin U was not assayed in the present study. Quantitative High performance liquid chromatography- diode array detector analysis demonstrated that the content of caseargrewiin F in the extract was 40.0 mg/g. Additionally, the chromatogram (Figure 2) presented 29 peaks with UV spectrum similar to observed for casearins and caseargrewiin F (kmax 5 231–236 nm). The results of chemical analysis suggest the presence of these clerodane diterpenes in the extract. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) for ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table I. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were observed at 50 and 75 mg/kg (both P , 0.01). The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that there was no cytotoxic effect on mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris Table II shows the protective effect of the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. Since Tween 20 (20%) was used to dissolve the ethanolic extract, in the vehicle control this solution was administered before the CP to ensure that it has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect of the test group. Consequently, there is no difference between Tween 20 (20%) plus CP and positive control. When the protective effect was evaluated by the MN test, an antimuta- genic effect was observed in mice treated with 6.25 (P , 0.01) and 12.5 mg/kg (P , 0.05). However, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not reduce the DNA damage to the basal level. In the comet assay, the ethanolic extract from C.sylvestris signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 3.13 (P , 0.01), 6.25 (P , 0.01), 12.5 (P , 0.05) and 25 mg/kg (P , 0.05). Mutagenicity and genotoxicity—caseargrewiin F The results of the mutagenicity test in mouse bone marrow (MN test) and the genotoxicity test in mouse peripheral blood cells (comet assay) of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris are shown in Table III. Clastogenicity and primary damage were observed at 3.8 mg/kg b.w. of caseargrewiin F (both P , 0.05) Fig. 2. Results from HPLC-DAD analysis. (A) Chromatogram of extract from the leaves of Casearia sylvestris; asterisk (*) indicates peaks with UV spectrum similar to casearins and caseargrewiina F. (B) Caseargrewiin F UV spectrum. Casearia sylvestris protects DNA damage 503 in, respectively, the MN test and comet assay. The parameter used to assess genotoxicity by comet assay was % DNA in tail. The ratio between PCEs and NCEs did not show statistically signiﬁcant variation, indicating that caseargrewiin F was not cytotoxic to mouse bone marrow cells. Antimutagenicity and antigenotoxicity of caseargrewiin F The antimutagenesis/antigenotoxicity assays were performed to determine if caseargrewiin F protects DNA from inducible damage (CP, 50 mg/kg b.w.). Table IV shows the protective effect of caseargrewiin F against inducible DNA damage in mouse blood cells through the MN test and comet assay. In the positive control, water was administered before CP, in order to maintain the same conditions as in the test groups (gavage intake) while determining the DNA damage induced by the CP without protection. To verify that Tween 80 has no inﬂuence on the antimutagenic effect in the test group, we administered the emulsifying solution before the CP. The negative control was used to check basal levels of DNA damage. The caseargrewiin F did not show a statistically signiﬁcant protective effect when assessed by the MN test. However, in the comet assay, it signiﬁcantly reduced the % DNA in tail at concentrations of 0.63 (P , 0.01), 1.3 (P , 0.01) and 2.5 (P , 0.01) mg/kg b.w. Discussion Previously, natural products have been used in popular medicine to treat several diseases without any knowledge about how harmful these compounds may be to human health. Recently, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of these natural products (19–21). In the present study, distinct assays were performed to reveal whether the ethanolic extracts of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F were mutagenic and or genotoxic. The results presented here demonstrated that the extract was genotoxic and mutagenic at highest concentrations in comet assay and MN test (50 and 75 mg/kg b.w.). Caseargrewiin F was both mutagenic and Table I.

M. de Oliveira et al. 504 genotoxic at the highest dose of 3.8 mg/kg b.w. A similar result was obtained in a recent study that describes mutagenic and genotoxic activity at high concentrations of another clerodane diterpene assessed by the MN test and comet assay (22). Considering that comet assay detects genomic lesions that are susceptible to DNA repair while MN test reveals more drastically lesions in chromosome level (23), it is important to realize that the two highest concentrations of ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and at the high concentration case- argreiin F induced unrepairable DNA damage. A mutagenic effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F could represent a potential antitumour property, as previous works on C.sylvestris demonstrated strong antitumour activity against Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (17) and its casearins (clerodane diterpenes) exhibited a strong cytotoxic activity against V-79 tumour cells (18). Interestingly, in the comet assay, the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris was more efﬁcient at preventing primary DNA damage at low concentrations (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). The molecules with non-mutagenic and/or antimutagenic properties could have antioxidant properties and, sometimes, may activate DNA repair pathways (24). They may act directly on the mutagenic process, by increasing the ﬁdelity in DNA replication (desmutagens) or by stimulating DNA damage error-free repair (bio-antimutagenesis) (25). Additionally, ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris did not presented a dose- dependent response in both comet assay and MN test, and this result can be affected by various associated factors such as dependence of the effect of the substance on dose, the complexity of the test organism and the inﬂuence of simultaneous metabolic routes and enzymatic pathways (26). Caseargrewiin F was not antimutagenic when assessed by the MN test, but showed an antigenotoxic dose-dependent re- sponse in the comet assay over the range of 0.63–2.5 mg/kg b.w. (Table IV). In accordance with the present work, previous study has demonstrated that essential oil of C.sylvestris has clastogenicity and anticlastogenicity in HTC cell line (27). Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were identiﬁed in the essential oil (28) whereas in the present study, sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes were identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract. Among 15 sesquiter- penes identiﬁed in the ethanolic extract, 13 were previous identiﬁed in essential oil (11,28). The mutagenic and genotoxic activity as well as the protective effect of the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris could be related to the sesquiterpenes. Additionally, there are recent studies that describe sesquiter- penes as chemopreventive (27,29). However, we cannot exclude the potential biological effects of the clerodane diterpenes since caseargrewiin F protected DNA from primary damage. Moreover, the use of mice instead of cell lines to assess protective effect of ethanolic extract could better verify absorption and metabolism of C.sylvestris in a complex organism. Recently, natural products have been described to protect DNA from damage and cause DNA damage (30,31) as observed in the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and case- argrewiin F. Similar results were obtained in earlier studies and described these products as Janus compounds, referring to the mytological Roman god Janus, who had two faces in the same: one looking forward and the other backward (32). Comet assay also revealed that C.sylvestris exhibited chemoprotective effects, but was not able to reduce the levels of DNA damage to negative controls values. Other studies suggested similar effects. Santos and Takahashi (33) demonstrated that seleno- methionine, a selenium-derived antioxidant compound, was both genotoxic and antigenotoxic and reduced the levels of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, but not to values as low as the negative control. Cytotoxic events could lead to overestimation of the chemoprotective effects observed here. Thus, it is also important to consider that C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F did not exhibit cytotoxic effects alone neither in combination with the CP as observed in the PCE/NCE values. Likewise, the chemoprotective effects can be considered only in the concentrations that did not exhibit genotoxic effects, a recom- mendation of the publication of Zeiger (34). Thus, our results demonstrate that the beneﬁts of using ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F as DNA protective compounds could be respectively safe at doses ,50 mg/kg b.w. and 3.8 mg/kg b.w. We conclude that the ethanolic extract of C.sylvestris and caseargrewiin F protects DNA against damage in low concentrations, which was carefully estimated by using MN test and comet assay. Keeping in mind that the same ethanolic extract and caseargrewiin F also can cause DNA damage in high concentrations.

Our biochemical tests show that it has inhibitory activity against the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyl- transferase (APRT) from Leishmania, a tropical parasite causing endemic disease in poor countries. It crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group P21/c, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, and has at least two CÐH O intermole- cular interactions, leading to the formation of centrosym- metric dimers. Comment Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a protozoal parasite of the order Kinetoplastid. According to the World Heath Organization reports (WHO, 1998), 88 countries are affected, with 12 million infected people and approximately 350 million people at risk. The need for new drugs for the treatment of the leishmaniasis infections comes from a lack of safe drugs and the serious secondary effects observed in available chemo- therapy (McGreevy & Marsden, 1986). The purine nucleotide salvage pathway in Kinetoplastid is a potential target for the development of new drugs, owing to its dependence on that biosynthetic pathway (Berens et al., 1995). In Kinetoplastid, the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) protein family is responsible for purine nucleotide salvage. Looking for new bioactive substances, potentially useful against leishmaniasis, we used the PRTase adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) from L. tarentolae as a model system to screen the inhibitory capacity of several small molecule compounds from Brazilian plants. The screening was performed using the APRT inhibitory assay, either in the presence of extracts or with the puri®ed compound, and was monitored spectrophotometrically (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1980). The title compound, (I), was isolated from A. fusci¯orus extracts and has been structurally investigated because of its inhibitory activity against APRT. Enzymatic tests of (I) at 50 mg/ml show an inhibition activity of 68%. Further investigations by molecular docking and dynamic simulations will be performed to study the interactions Received 28 July 2003 Accepted 8 September 2003 Online 18 September 2003 organic papers o1504 H. B. Napolitano et al. C14H13NO4 Acta Cryst. (2003). E59, o1503±o1505 between this compound and the APRT active site. In light of this interest, structural characterization will give us important information with respect to the interaction mode of compound (I) with APRT, and allow the investigation of possible inhi- bition of that compound by other PRTases. With the aim of obtaining more accurate structural data for comparison of (I) and other inhibitors against APRT enzyme, and in order to use this information in molecular docking and dynamic simulations, we undertook a structure determination at 120 K. An ORTEP view (Farrugia, 1997) of compound (I), together with the atom-labelling scheme, is shown in Fig. 1. All bond lengths and angles of this compound are close to normal values (Allen et al., 1983). The crystallographic structure of (I), measured at room temperature, has been previously published (Cox et al., 1989). The crystal packing of (I) does not show any strong hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, two weak intermolecular interactions of the type CÐH O (C10ÐH10 O3i, C12Ð H12 O3ii) and two of the type CÐH N (C10ÐH10 Ni and C14ÐH14 Niii) stabilize the three-dimensional struc- ture (symmetry codes as in Table 1). The latter type links two neighbouring molecules in a centrosymmetric dimeric form, as shown in Fig. 2. The C10ÐH10 O3i interaction is respon- sible for the formation of in®nite chains along the b axis, and C12ÐH12 O3ii for the formation of in®nite chains along the c axis. All structural details of the intermolecular contacts for compound (I) were interpreted as hydrogen bonds on geometrical grounds (Ellena et al., 2001). Experimental The roots and leaves of A. fusci¯orus were collected from the Manaus region of the Brazilian Amazon forest in December 2000. An authenticated specimen was deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto de Pesquisas da Amazonia±INPA (code 189859). The powdered parts (roots 2.380 kg and leaves 1.040 kg) were extracted successively with hexane (10 l) and methanol (8.5 l). The crude hexane crude extract of the root (5.0 g) was extracted by chroma- tography on a silica gel column ( h = 28 2 cm). Fractions 6 and 7 were combined and subjected to silica gel column chromatography, using the isocratic system (hexane/ethyl acetate 7:3). Fraction 8 was collected according to TLC analysis (normal phase) and fractions 6 and 7 were combined and subjected to CCDP using hexane/ethyl acetate 7:3 as the mobile phase. 10 mg of compound (I) were obtained; this crystallized by vapour diffusion as a prismatic, light yellow solid, using 1:1 hexane/dichloromethane as solvent.

This compound crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. There is one strong hydrogen bond, with OD OA = 2.6238 (12) AÊ and ODÐH OA = 171.1 (17) involving the COOH group, forming a cyclic dimer about a center of symmetry. The packing of the molecules is additionally stabilized by one CÐ H O [CD OA = 2.9820 (16) AÊ and CDÐH OA = 101.8 (10)] and two CÐH intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Comment The title carboxylic acid, (I), has been investigated because of its interesting inhibitory activity against adenine phospho- ribosyltransferase (APRT) from Leishmania tarentolae which is a member of the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) family. The PRTases are responsible for the salvage of purine, pyridine and pyrimidine nucleotides, as well as aromatic amino acids. Most organisms synthesize adenine nucleotides by both the de novo and the salvage pathways. In contrast, protozoan parasites are strict purine nucleotide auxotrophs because of the absence of a purine de novo biosynthetic pathway (Berens et al., 1995). Therefore, these microorgan- isms are absolutely dependent on scavenging pre-formed purine nucleotides from the host or the media (Ullman & Carter, 1997). To look for new potential anti-leishmania drugs, we used the APRT from L. tarentolae as a model system to investigate the inhibitory capacity of A. fusci¯orus extracts. The screening was performed using a spectrophotometric assay (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1980); the IC50 of pure compound (I) is 147 mM. In view of this interest, we have extracted the title compound, (I), and present here its crystal structure. Compound (I) crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The re®ned molecular structure, together with the atom-labeling scheme, are shown in Fig. 1 (Johnson, 1965). All the bond distances and angles are close to normal values (Allen et al., Received 3 July 2003 Accepted 22 September 2003 Online 30 September 2003 organic papers o1576 M. Silva et al. C16H20O5 Acta Cryst. (2003). E59, o1575±o1577 1983). The benzene ring C4±C9 in the central part of the molecule is very nearly planar, the maximum deviation of any of its atoms from the least-squares plane describing them being 0.0051 (8) AÊ , while the average deviation is 0.0030 (9) AÊ . Atoms (C2, C3, C16, O17, O18 and O19) around the benzene ring are coplanar [r.m.s. deviation 0.0535 (10) AÊ ]. Thus, the structure exhibits a planar central moiety, a typical structural feature observed in anti-leishmania inhibitors (Chan-Bacab & PenÄa-Rodrigues, 2001). Several packing features may be noted (Spek, 1990). There are classical intermolecular hydrogen bonds [O21Ð H21 O20i; symmetry code: (i) 1 2 ÿ x, 1 2 ÿ y, 1 ÿ z] between the COOH groups of neighbouring molecules, forming a centrosymmetric dimer (Fig. 2). O21 O20i is 2.6238 (12) AÊ and O21ÐH21 O20i is 171.1 (17). There is also a weak C16ÐH16B O21ii [symmetry code: (ii) x, ÿy, z ÿ 1 2] intermolecular hydrogen bond that is responsible for stabilization of the in®nite parallel chains (Fig. 3). Furthermore, two intermolecular CÐH interac- tions involve atoms C15 and C16 and the cloud of the benzene ring. The former is between atom H15A and the - ring of a molecule at (ÿx, 1 ÿ y, ÿz) and the second between atom H16A and the molecule at (ÿx, ÿy, ÿz). These are characterized by the distances C15 CgBz and C16 CgBz of 3.5534 (15) and 3.6568 (15) AÊ , respectively, and by the angles C15ÐH15A CgBz and C16ÐH16A CgBz of 129.4 (11) and 152.2 (11), respectively (CgBz denotes the centroid of the benzene ring). These interactions link in®nite parallel chains, as shown in Fig. 4. All geometrical details of the intermolecular contacts were interpreted as hydrogen bonds on geometrical grounds (Ellena et al., 2001); Table 2 reports the relevant geometrical parameters. Experimental The roots and leaves of A. fusci¯orus were collected in Manaus-AM/ Brazil in December 2000.

The hexane extract of the root (5.0 g) was chromatographed on an silica gel column ( h = 28 2 cm) using a hexane/EtOAc gradient to fractionate the extract. Nine fractions were collected. Fraction 5 (hexane±ethyl acetate 7:3) was chroma- tographed on an silica gel column ( h = 50 1.5 cm) using a gradient system of hexane, ethyl acetate and methylene chloride. 42 fractions were collected and, based on normal phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC), seven fractions were pooled.

After decades of intensive searching for antimicrobial compounds derived from actinobacteria, the frequency of isolation of new molecules has decreased. To cope with this concern, studies have focused on the exploitation of actinobacteria from unexplored environments and actinobacteria symbionts of plants and animals. In this study, twenty-four actinobacteria strains isolated from workers of Trachymyrmex ants were evaluated for antifungal activity towards a variety of Candida species. Results revealed that seven strains inhibited the tested Candida species. Streptomyces sp. TD025 presented potent and broad spectrum of inhibition of Candida and was selected for the isolation of bioactive molecules. From liquid shake culture of this bacterium, we isolated the rare antimycin urauchimycins A and B. For the first time, these molecules were evaluated for antifungal activity against medically important Candida species. Both antimycins showed antifungal activity, especially urauchimycin B. This compound inhibited the growth of all Candida species tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin. Our results concur with the predictions that the attine ant-microbe symbiosis may be a source of bioactive metabolites for biotechnology and medical applications. 1. Introduction The increased resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics is a problem of public health [1]. The increasing number of fungal species that can infect humans, particularly immunocompro- mised individuals, further reinforces this concern. A limited number of antifungal agents are commercially available when compared to antibacterial drugs. This scenario motivates the search for new bioactive compounds in various biological systems using several approaches, including metagenomics and microbial genome-mining. Actinobacteria are widely known for their ability to pro- duce bioactive secondary metabolites, especially compounds with antimicrobial activity. These bacteria are responsible for producing two-thirds of the commercially available antibi- otics [2, 3]. Most actinobacteria species explored commer- cially were isolated from the soil. However, after decades of bioprospecting actinobacteria from this environment, it is becoming more difficult to obtain strains producing novel bioactive metabolites [4]. Thus, many companies have turned the search for microbial producers of novel antifungal com- pounds to other environments such as hydrothermal vents, 2 BioMed Research International marine environments, tropical rain forests, and microbial symbionts associated with plants and animals hosts [5, 6]. For example, the occurrence of actinobacteria associated with marine sponges and the fact that such strains produce com- pounds with antimicrobial activity confirms this potential [7– 9]. In addition, endophytic actinobacteria are also explored for their capacity to produce antimicrobial compounds [10– 12]. Several studies have focused on the association between actinobacteria and insects from an ecological perspective [13–25]. On the other hand, few studies have focused on the multitude of chemical compounds that are involved in such interactions [26]. The best studied example is the symbiosis between actinobacteria and fungus-growing ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: tribe Attini). In this association, the actinobacteria are found on the ants’ integument and produce antimicrobial compounds that help the ants to suppress the microfungus Escovopsis sp. [13, 14]. This fungus is considered a specialized parasite of the ant cultivar and causes negative impacts to the ant colony [27]. Actinobacteria isolated from the integument of attine ants are generally classified in the genus Pseudonocardia and Streptomyces. Bioactive molecules have already been isolated and characterized from actinobacteria isolated from several attine genera [26]. Pseudonocardia isolated from Acromyrmex octospinosus and Apterostigma dentigerum are known to pro- duce several compounds like (i) dentigerumycin, a complex compound active against Candida albicans and Escovopsis [28]; (ii) a nystatin-like antifungal [29]; (iii) the novel quinone pseudonocardones A–C active against the malaria causal agent Plasmodium berghei [30]; (iv) the already known antibi- otics 6-deoxy-8-O-methylrabelomycin and X-14 881, both active against Bacillus subtilis and P. berghei [30]. In addition to Pseudonocardia, actinobacteria in the genus Streptomyces are also found on the integument of Acromyrmex workers and were shown to produce (i) candicidin, active against Escovopsis sp. [29, 31–34], (ii) antimycins active against Escovopsis sp. [32–34], and (iii) actinomycin D, actinomycin X2 and valinomycin that are active against B. subtilis [32]. Poulsen [35] suggested that the attine ant-microbe asso- ciation is little explored regarding the search for new antimicrobials. The author highlights the various symbiotic associations between attine ants and microorganisms as a promising source for drug discovery, especially those with antimicrobial activity. Here, we explored the antimicrobial potential of actinobacteria isolated from the integument of Trachymyrmex fungus-growing ants and demonstrate the action against different medically important Candida species. We also report two previously described urauchimycins from a Streptomyces strain and emphasize the newly discovered anti-Candida activity of these compounds. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification. Twelve Trachymyrmex colonies were collected in different Brazilian biomes (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/835081). Colonies were carefully excavated in order to reach the first fungus garden chamber. Fungus garden with the tending workers and brood was sampled using an alcohol-flamed spoon and stored in sterile plastic containers. All containers were kept in a cooler during transport to the laboratory where they were maintained at 25∘C. From each colony, we randomly selected four workers for actinobacteria isolation. Then, the propleural plates were scraped with a sterile needle under a low power stereomicroscope. All ants used in the present study had a visible, whitish covering on the propleural plates. Scrapings were plated on SCN agar (in g ⋅L−1: 10.0 starch, 0.3 casein, 2.0 KNO3, 2.0 NaCl, 2.0 K2HPO4, 0.05 MgSO4 ⋅7 H2O, 0.02 CaCO3, 0.01 FeSO4 ⋅7H2O and 18.0 agar supplemented with 0.05 Nystatin) [36]. After scraping, the entire body of all workers was inoculated on SCN agar. All plates were incubated at 25∘C for 30 days. From each sampled Trachymyrmex colony, one representative strain was selected from each morphotype obtained. The strains were subcultured in YMA (in g ⋅L−1: 3.0 yeast extract, 3.0 malt extract, 5.0 peptone, 10.0 glucose, 18.0 agar) and stored at −80∘C in 15% glycerol. We used a molecular approach to provide taxonomic affiliation to actinobacteria strains. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method of Sampaio et al. [37]. We carried out 16S rDNA PCR with the universal primers 27F (5-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-3) and 1492R (5- TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3) [38]. Reactions were conducted in a final volume of 25 𝜇L and contained 1 𝜇L of diluted DNA template (1 : 10), 2.0 𝜇L of each primer (10 mM), 2.5 𝜇L of 10X buffer, 1.0 𝜇L of MgCl2 (50 mM), 4.0 𝜇L of dNTPs (1.25 mM each), 0.2 𝜇L of Taq polymerase (5 U/𝜇L), and 12.3 𝜇L of ultrapure water. Amplicons were cleaned up with GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purifica- tion Kit (GE Healthcare). Forward and reverse sequences were generated using the same primers, along with an internal primer U519F (5-CAGCMGCCGCGGTAATWC- 3). Sequences were generated using BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies) in an ABI 3130 sequencer and manually edited in BioEdit v. 7.1.3 [39]. Contigs were compared with those available in the databases NCBI- GenBank (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Ribossomal Database Project (RDP, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). Sequences generated in the present study were deposited in NCBI- GenBank (accessions KC480554-KC480557). A phylogenetic analysis was carried out in order to deter- mine the taxonomic affiliation of strain TD025. Sequences of closest relatives were retrieved from the NCBI-GenBank and the RDP Project and aligned in ClustalW. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in PAUP v. 4.0 [40]. Genetic dis- tances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model of nucleotide substitution [41]. Robustness of the relation- ships was estimated from 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. 2.2. Organic Extracts and Antifungal Assays. All actinobac- teria were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 50 mL of modified MPE medium (in g ⋅L−1: 5.0 soy flour, BioMed Research International 3 20.0 glucose, 5.0 of NaCl, 4.0 CaCO3) [42]. Each flask was inoculated with five mycelium disks (1 cm in diameter) cut from a previously grown culture and then incubated at 28∘C for two days on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. From this culture, 10 mL was inoculated in two Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 100 mL of the same medium and incu- bated for five days on the same conditions. After incubation, the fermented broth was separated from the mycelium by centrifugation and partitioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the EtOAc extracts were diluted in RPMI-1640 culture broth containing 10% DMSO and used in the antimicrobial assays. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evalu- ated against the yeasts Candida albicans CBS 562, Candida dubliniensis CBS 7987, Candida glabrata CBS 138, Candida krusei CBS 573, Candida parapsilosis CBS 604, and Candida tropicalis CBS 94. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the microdilution method according to the M27-A2 standard of the Clinical and Lab- oratory Standards Institute [43]. 2.3. Isolation and Characterization of the Bioactive Com- pounds of Strain TD025. The actinobacteria strain that exhib- ited both a broad antifungal spectrum and lower MIC values was strain TD025. In order to identify the compounds responsible for the observed results, the strain was cultured in 5 L of modified MPE medium and the extracts were obtained as described. The fermented broth (5 L) was separated from the cells by centrifugation and portioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The crude extract, a dark green oil (1.40 g), was separated by means of column chromatography using silica gel 60 eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc as the elution gradient, yielding 8 fractions. All fractions were submitted to antimicrobial assays against C. albicans following the procedure described above. The most active fraction (67.5 mg) was subjected to preparative TLC (thin layer chromatography) eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7 : 3) two times, yielding 3 subfractions. The subfractions obtained were submitted to antimicrobial assays against C. albicans. The most active subfraction was submitted to semipreparative HPLC separations carried out in a Shimadzu (LC-6AD apparatus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP). The separation was carried out using VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18 column eluted with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50 : 50 : 0.01) at a flow rate of 3 mL ⋅min−1, yielding com- pounds 1 and 2. The isolated molecules were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic experiments recorded on a BRUKER DRX-400 spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard. 2.4. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Fungi- cide Concentration of Bioactive Compounds. After isola- tion and determination of the structure of the targeted compounds, they were evaluated for antimicrobial activity following the method described previously. Besides the MIC determination, we also evaluated the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The MFC was determined by inoculat- ing Sabouraud dextrose medium with 10 𝜇L of the contents of each of the wells where there was growth inhibition of yeast, the MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the substance capable of preventing the onset of colony forming units. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification. Several acti- nobacteria colonies were observed after incubation of iso- lation plates. We selected just one morphotype of each per ant colony, rendering a total of 24 strains ouf of 12 Tra- chymyrmex spp. nests (Table S1). Four actinobacteria genera were identified and Streptomyces was the most abundant taxon (Table 1), corresponding to 66.67% of the strains. It is assumed that the main actinobacteria associated with the integument of attine workers is the genus Pseudonocardia [14–16, 20]. However, several authors have demonstrated the isolation of actinobacteria other than Pseudonocardia on the integument of attine ants [17–19, 21, 22, 29, 31]. The prevalence of Streptomyces and absence of Pseudonocardia among our isolates may be due to the culture medium used [44]. The SCN medium is suitable for the isolation of fast-growing actinobacteria, but according to other authors [13–16], the use of a low-nutrient medium, such as chitin agar, may provide the recovery of Pseudonocardia strains. In eight out of 12 ant colonies, we obtained more than one actinobacteria morphotype (Table S1). From colony CTL080820-02, the two morphotypes isolated from two different workers were identified as the same actinobacteria species (Tables S1 and 1). On the other hand, different actinobacteria species were isolated in the seven remaining colonies. We also observed the occurrence of different acti- nobacteria strains in a single worker (Tables S1 and 1). This result demonstrates the diversity of actinobacteria present on the integument of these ants (Table S1, nests SES080911-04 and SES080924-01). The 16S rDNA sequence of strain TD025 showed 99% similarity with sequences of several species of the genus Streptomyces deposited in the databases. For a better charac- terization, we performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). The result suggests a differentiated phylogenetic position for strain TD025 when compared with the remaining sequences. This preliminary analysis allowed us to assign this strain as belonging to the genus Streptomyces, with S. cirratus as the closest relative strain (Figure 1). However, more refined phylogenetic analyses, along with morphological and physi- ological studies, are necessary to ensure the identification of TD025 to the species level. 3.2. Screening for Antifungal Activity. Our screening for antifungal activity revealed that seven out of 24 extracts (29.16%) inhibited the growth of at least one Candida species. C. albicans was the most sensitive yeast and was 4 BioMed Research International Table 1: Actinobacteria identification according to 16S rDNA sequencing.

The yeasts C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were the most resistant strains, being inhibited by one and two actinobacteria extracts, respectively, with MIC values of 1000 𝜇g ⋅mL−1 (Table 2). Except for strain TD034 identified as Amycolatopsis decaplanina (Table 1), the other actinobacteria exhibiting antimicrobial activity were identified as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. This genus is recognized as the largest producer of antibiotics because from approximately 3,000 known antibiotics obtained from actinobacteria, the genus Streptomyces contributes with 90% of this total [45]. The extracts of Streptomyces sp. TD025 and Streptomyces crystallinus TD027 showed activity against all yeast strains except for C. glabrata. These extracts were effective against C. albicans and C. krusei and showed low activity against C. tropicalis (Table 2). More interestingly, both strains were isolated from the same colony but from independent workers (Table 1). Because lower MICs were obtained for the extract of Streptomyces sp. TD025, this strain was selected to verify the chemical compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity. 3.3. Bioactive Compounds of Streptomyces sp. TD025. Chro- matographic procedures revealed that EtOAc extract from TD025 contains two compounds (1 and 2, Figure 2). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited typical NMR data of urauchimycins (Figures S1 and S2). Their NMR data are in agreement with those previously reported by Imamura et al. [46]. Although these urauchimycins (1 and 2) have already been isolated, they have never been tested on various species of Candida as carried out in the present study. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 22 carbon signals: four carbonyls (𝛿179.0, 𝛿170.6, 𝛿169.8, and 𝛿158.7), three quaternary sp2 carbons (𝛿150.6, 𝛿127.4, and 𝛿112.8), three methine aromatic carbons (𝛿124.8, 𝛿120.6, and 𝛿119.0), two sp3 methylene group (𝛿35.6 and 𝛿30.5), three sp3 methine groups (𝛿54.0, 𝛿50.1, and 𝛿32.4), three oxymethinic groups (𝛿77.1, 𝛿76.3, and 𝛿70.9), and four methyl groups (𝛿18.4, 𝛿18.4, 𝛿15.1, and 𝛿11.4). Two carboxylic carbons 𝛿170.6 and 𝛿173.9 showed correlations with different hydrogens of the structure, showing a dilactone system of nine members, typical of the antimycin class. The 1H NMR spectrum showed a singlet at 𝛿8.50, assigned to a hydrogen bounded to a carbonyl group and three aromatic hydrogens at 𝛿8.55 (dd, J 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), 𝛿7.24 (dd, J 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), and d 6.92 (t, J 8.1 Hz), suggesting a 1,2,3 trisubstituted aromatic ring. The substance was identified as urauchimycin A by comparison with the literature data [46]. The 1H and 13C NMR spectram of 2 were very similar to those observed for compound 1.

Urauchimycins belong to the antimycin class, a group of well-known antifungals. Antimycins act by inhibiting the electron flow in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [47]. Antimycins have been previously identified in Streptomyces isolated from the integument of attine ants [32–34]. Schoe- nian and colleagues [32] detected the well-know antimycins A1–A4 in 50% of the actinobacteria identified as Streptomyces isolated from workers of several Acromyrmex species. These data along with the rare antimycins identified in the present study indicate that this chemical class is often produced by Streptomyces associated with attine ants. Compounds belonging to this class may have an important role in the attine ant-microbe association. Another antifungal compound widely distributed in Streptomyces associated with attine ants is candicidin [31–34], which was not detected in Streptomyces sp. TD025. It is possible that candicidin was lost in one of the purification steps of the AcOEt extract or it is not produced by this strain. Urauchimycins A and B were previously isolated from Streptomyces sp. Ni-80 isolated from a marine sponge in Urauchicove, Irimore, Japan. These substances were the first antimycins having an odd number of carbons and a branching side chain [46]. Imamura et al. [46] suggested that such structures are the result of an evolution of actinobacteria in the marine environment, which could have resulted in a change in their secondary metabolism. In 2006, two new urauchimycins were described: urau- chimycin C, isolated from Streptomyces sp. B1751 from marine sediment, and urauchimycin D, isolated from Streptomyces sp. AdM21 from soil [48]. In the study by Imamura and coworkers [46], the urauchimycins A and B inhibited the morphological differentiation of C. albicans up to a con- centration of 10 𝜇g ⋅mL−1. Urauchimycins C and D showed no inhibitory activity against C. albicans, Mucor miehei, and bacteria [48]. The study of antimicrobial activity of urauchimycins A and B was restricted to C. albicans in the work by Imamura and colleagues [46]. The reisolation of these molecules in the present study allowed a better evaluation of its spectrum of 6 BioMed Research International Table 2: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (𝜇g⋅mL−1) of actinobacteria extracts towards different medically important Candida species.

The urauchimycins from Streptomyces sp. TD025 pre- sented MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nys- tatin for C. albicans and C. glabrata (Table 3). Urauchimycin B showed inhibitory activity against all Candida strains eval- uated, showing MIC similar to those provided by nystatin. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity against Candida spp. with MIC values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin, which indicates the potential for medical use. For many years, antimycins were used for the treatment of human infections, but due to its mechanism of action and associated side effects, its use in human treatment was discontinued [47]. However, with the pressing need for new antifungal agents that complement or substitute for the scarce products available on the market, it is interesting and nec- essary to determine the toxicity presented by urauchimycin B, to assess whether it can be used as an antifungal agent for humans and animals. In addition, evaluation of the isolated compound against Candida species resistant to commercially available antifungal agents should be performed to confirm the potential of this relatively unexplored antifungal. Here we show that Trachymyrmex ants, one attine genus understudied with respect to its microbial symbionts, har- bor antimicrobial-producing actinobacteria. As observed by other authors [28–33], the present study demonstrates that BioMed Research International 7 Table 3: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicide concentrations (MFC) (𝜇g⋅mL−1) of Urauchimycins A and B obtained from Streptomyces sp.

Moreover, our study corroborates previous work [35] that suggests the attine ant-microbe association is a promising source of microorganisms that produce active metabolites. The few recent studies that focused on the chemical charac- terization of bioactive compounds produced by actinobacte- ria associated with attine ants support the potential isolation of novel molecules with biological activity [28–32]. Thus, an exploration program of isolation of bioactive molecules from actinobacteria from attine ants certainly will result in the discovery of novel compounds with activity against microorganisms that are potentially pathogenic to humans. 4. Conclusion As suggested by Poulsen [35], we found that the integument of Trachymrymex ants is a potential source for the isolation of actinobacteria that produce bioactive molecules. The isola- tion of Urauchimycins A and B enabled, for the first time, the evaluation of their activity against various Candida species. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity and MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nystatin. Toxicity studies and in vivo activity should be carried out in order to verify the potential use of this molecule in the treatment of fungal infections.

These drugs are, however, not consistently effective and, moreover, exhibit serious side effects including cardiac and/or renal toxicity.2) There is thus particular inter- est in the discovery of natural products that might be devel- oped to generate safer and more efﬁcient chemotherapeutic agents against T. cruzi.3) A number of biologically-active chromenes have been isolated from species of the genus Piper, including the prenylated chromene 1 from Piper gaudichaudianum4) and chromenes 2—5 (Fig. 1) from P. aduncum.5) Whilst these chromenes have been shown to exhibit anti-fungal4) and anti- tumour properties,5) no evaluation has yet been made with respect to their activity against T. cruzi. The object of the present study was to examine a range of natural chromenes and chromene derivatives in order to determine their poten- tial for further development to treat Chagas disease. METHODS AND RESULTS General All reagents were of analytical grade. For methylation reactions, an ethereal solution of diazomethane (30 ml) was prepared by dissolving 2.14 g of N-methyl-N-ni- troso-p-toluenesulphonamide (Diazald; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 10.0 ml of ethanol containing 4.0% potassium hydroxide.6) Hydrogenation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium (3.0 or 10.0%) on activated charcoal (Acros Organics, New Jer- sey, U.S.A.) as catalyst.7) The acetylated chromene was pre- pared by treatment with acetic anhydride (20.0 ml) and pyri- dine (20.0 ml) overnight.8) Benznidazole, employed as posi- tive control in the assays of trypanocidal activity, was ob- tained from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Plant Material Specimens of P. gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum were cultivated from seed under greenhouse con- ditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru) and voucher specimens (with codes Kato 0093 and 0057, respectively) were deposited at the Herbarium of the 538 Vol. 31, No. 3 Notes Natural Chromenes and Chromene Derivatives as Potential Anti-trypanosomal Agents João Marcos BATISTA Jr.,a Adriana Aparecida LOPES,a Daniela Luz AMBRÓSIO,b Luis Octávio REGASINI,a Massuo Jorge KATO,c Vanderlan da Silva BOLZANI,a Regina Maria Barretto CICARELLI,b and Maysa FURLAN*,a a Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Prof. Francisco Degni, 14801–970, Araraquara, SP, Brazil: b Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Rodovia Araraquara/Jaú Km 1, 14801–902, Araraquara, SP, Brazil and c Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo; Av.

Received September 18, 2007; accepted December 6, 2007; published online December 13, 2007 The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-trypanocidal activities of natural chromene and chromene derivatives. Five chromenes were isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum, and a further seven de- rivatives were prepared using standard reduction, methylation and acetylation procedures. These compounds were assayed in vitro against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The results showed that the most of the compounds, especially those possessing electron-donating groups as sub- stituents on the aromatic ring, showed potent trypanocidal activity. The most active compound, [(2S)-methyl-2- methyl-8-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate], was almost four times more potent than benznidazole (the positive control) and showed an IC50 of 2.82 mM. The results reveal that chromenes exhibit signiﬁcant anti-trypanocidal activities and indicate that this class of natural product should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas dis- ease.

Characterization of Chromenes and Derivatives The structures of all isolates and their derivatives were conﬁrmed from the NMR data as shown below. Assignments were based on 2D-NMR experiments including gHMQC and gHMBC.

Evaluation of Trypanocidal Activity Assays of the anti- parasitic activities of the isolates and their derivatives were conducted by screening their effects on the proliferation of epimastigotes of T. cruzi Y-strain grown in axenic culture in LIT medium. Stock solutions (containing 1.0 mg/ml) of the natural chromenes and their derivatives were prepared in di- methylsulphoxide and serially diluted (1 : 3) in liver infusion tryptose medium to yield sample solutions with concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg/ml. The number of remaining viable protozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber following incubation at 28 °C for 72 h with the test sample. All assays were con- ducted in triplicate. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined by linear regression analysis. The IC50 values for compounds 1—12 and for benznidazole (em- March 2008 539 ployed as positive control) are shown in Table 1. For the sta- tistical analysis, method of probits was employed. DISCUSSION As part of an on-going screening program for new anti- chagasic drugs, the prenylated chromene [(2S)-2-methyl-8- (3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl)-2H- chromene-6-carboxylic acid] (1), the major metabolite of the ethanolic extract of Piper gaudichaudianum,4) was evaluated with respect to its toxicity against epimastigotes of T. cruzi and exhibited a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 value of 33.8 mM. On the basis of this ﬁnding, the natural benzopyrans 2—5 (isolated from P. aduncum) were assayed for trypanoci- dal activity together with some novel chromene derivatives obtained from 1, 3, 4 and 5 by simple chemical transforma- tions. Speciﬁcally, hydrogenation7) of the isoprene units and of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring of 1 produced the derivative 6. The benzopyran ester 7 was obtained from 1 by methylation with diazomethane,6) and this ester was subse- quently reduced to 8 by catalytic hydrogenation. Similarly, derivatives 9 and 10 were obtained from chromenes 3 and 4, respectively, whilst derivative 11 was obtained by selective hydrogenation of 5. Finally the chromene 4 was acetylated to 12. Most of the isolates together with their derivatives showed signiﬁcant trypanocidal activities in comparison with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 10.3 mM). Compound 7 proved to be the most active with an IC50 value of 2.82 mM, i.e. almost four times more potent than benznidazole. All compounds that showed activity possessed electron- donating substituents. Within this group the prenylated com- pounds 1, 5, 7 and 11 were the most active, whilst the ester derivative 7 (containing two prenyl units) was an extremely powerful trypanocidal agent with a potency ca. 10-fold greater than that of the corresponding acid. This ﬁnding sug- gests that both prenyl and ester substituents are necessary for the strongest anti-parasitic activity. The lower activity exhib- ited by chromene 2 compared with 3 corroborates the impor- tance of an ester group, and indicates a direct correlation be- tween the electronic nature of the substituents and trypanoci- dal activity. Moreover, the observed reduction in activity of 12 occasioned by the introduction of an electron-withdraw- ing acetyl group at C-8 following acetylation8) of 4, substan- tiates the inﬂuence of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1). Reduction of the double bonds of the prenyl substituents (as in derivatives 6 and 8) gave rise to a signiﬁcant decrease in toxicity indicating their essential role in trypanocidal ac- tivity. Furthermore, reduction of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring (as in derivatives 9 and 10) resulted in the total loss of toxicity suggesting that a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring is essential for trypanocidal activity. These results suggest that substituents on the aromatic ring that contribute to an increase in lipophilicity are also re- quired for activity (Table 1). In conclusion, several natural chromenes from P. gau- dichaudianum and P. aduncum, along with a series of semi- synthetic derivatives, have been shown to exhibit potential trypanocidal activities against epimastigotes of T. cruzi. The results suggest that chromenes should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.

Received July 2, 2007; accepted January 24, 2008; published online January 28, 2008 In early studies, we have reported the antinociceptive proﬁle of ()-spectaline, a piperidine alkaloid from Cassia spectabilis. The present study describes the synthesis, the antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities of a series of 2,3,6-trialkyl-piperidine alkaloids: the natural ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) and ten semi-synthetic spectaline derivatives. Structure–activity relationship (SARs) studies were performed. The struc- tures of all synthesized derivatives were conﬁrmed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance. Compounds were evaluated for their analgesic (acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constrictions, hot-plate test, formalin-in- duced pain test) and some of them for the anti-inﬂammatory activities (carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test). The pharmacological results showed that several of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than ()-spectaline. LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. In the formalin-induced pain only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the in- ﬂammatory phase, ()-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity. In the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, only ()-spectaline exhibited an anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg. Our results suggest different mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio-776 (3-O-Boc- spectaline), LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl-spectaline) and ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754).

Design Concept of the New 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Derivatives writhing test (ED5048.5 mmol/kg) and capsaicin induced pain (ED5020.8 mmol/kg).8) Extending our research program concerning the bio- prospection of natural products and its derivatives, we have selected, to conclude this investigation, another abundant piperidine alkaloid, ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio- 755, Chart 1) and synthesized other 10 semi-synthetic deriva- tives prepared from natural ()-spectaline, i.e. a series of 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloids. The present study was focused on the synthesis, evaluation of antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory properties and structure–activity rela- tionship (SAR) analysis of these new derivatives in order to verify the stereoelectronic contributions and requirements of the pharmacophoric groups A, B and C for the antinocicep- tive and anti-inﬂammatory activities (Chart 1). Results and Discussion The antinociceptive proﬁle of all new 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine derivatives developed herein was initially evalu- ated using classical acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constriction test,9) with indomethacin as standard. The results are disclosed in Fig. 1. Some of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than ()-spectaline and indomethacin. Among them, the natural acetate derivative (LASSBio-755) and its O-Boc analogue (LASSBio-776) were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. Based on these results some preliminary structure–activity relationships were analysed. Comparing the inhibitory proﬁle of compounds LASSBio- 782, LASSBio-821 and LASSBio-775 with LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755 indicates that the presence of groups that blocked the hydrogen bond donnor character of the piperi- dine nitrogen seems to be deletery for the analgesic activity. On the other hand, the antinociceptive activity showed to be inversely dependent of the volume of the groups at C-3 (OR1 group) once that the inhibition of the constrictions follows the order R1HAcBoc. The introduction of more polar and hydrogen bond-donating hydroxy groups at C-13 in the alcohol or oxime derivatives, i.e. LASSBio-781, LASSBio- 820 and LASSBio-784, did not result in a increase of the an- tinociceptive activity but indicated through the direct com- parison of the bioproﬁle of compounds LASSBio-781 and LASSBio-820 that the stereochemistry at C-3 seems to be a pharmacophoric requirement for an adequate ﬁt in the target receptor. Additionally, the introduction of an acetyl group at C-3 of LASSBio-755 modify drastically the toxicological as- pect of these alkaloids, once that it did not show any sign of toxicity when administered at a single dose of 500 mmol/kg (data not shown) in contrast with ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754).8) Considering the signiﬁcant antinociceptive activity ob- served for LASSBio-755 and its analogue LASSBio-776 we decided to investigate its effects on other models of pain and compare the results with that showed by ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754).8) In the formalin-induced pain10) only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the inﬂammatory phase, ()-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity (Fig. 2). Indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the later phase without interfering on the earlier one in the formalin-induced pain test.11) These results on the for- malin test led us to investigate the anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle of these same compounds on the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema.9) LASSBio-755 and, unexpectedly, LASSBio- 776 did not show an anti-inﬂammatory activity at the dose used. Only ()-spectaline was able to inhibit the edema for- mation, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg (Fig. 3). The same order of potency was observed for both antinociceptive (ED5048.5 mmol/kg)8) and anti-inﬂammatory (ED5056.6 mmol/kg) (Fig. 3) activities of ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754), indicating a common pathway of action. Despite the absence of effect on the neurogenic phase of the formalin test at the dose used, LASSBio-755 and LASS- Bio-776 showed a signiﬁcant increase in the latency time in the hot-plate test,12) similar to morphine, while ()-spec- taline (LASSBio-754), even at a dose of 300 mmol/kg, was inactive (Fig. 4). The hot-plate and formalin test differs in some aspects. Hot-plate test is based on the use of a short-duration nocicep- tive thermal stimulus (phasic pain) while formalin use a long-duration chemical stimulus (tonic pain). Tissue injury leads to a persistent afferent input in the latter. The nocicep- tive response in the ﬁrst phase of formalin and hot-plate models seems to result from direct activation of nociceptors and is inhibited by drugs which act mainly at central sites.13,14) Centrally acting analgesics are also effective in the second phase.10) This phase is attributed mainly to the devel- opment of an inﬂammatory reaction at the site of injection and increased synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.13) 408 Vol. 56, No. 4 Fig. 1.

Considering the central activity observed for LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 in the hot-plate test, it was expected to observe some activity in the earlier phase of the formalin that could be dependent of the magnitude of the dose. The ﬁrst phase of formalin is brief and occurs in the ﬁrst 5 min. The ﬁrst measure in the hot-plate test was at 30 min and only LASSBio-755 showed a signiﬁcant activity. LASSBio-776 showed a signiﬁcant activity from 60 min. Since the com- pounds were administered orally and the dose used was the same in both tests, the lack of activity on the neurogenic phase could be related with the pharmacokinetics proﬁle of the compounds and somewhat with the mechanisms of the pain processing in these different models. Recently, searching for new candidates compounds useful for treating Alzheimer’s disease, the chloride analogues of some of these semi-synthetic piperidine alkaloid derivatives were described as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.15) The cholinergic system was involved in the transmission of noci- ceptive information and cholinergic drugs, such as mus- carinic and nicotinic agonists, and also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were described to induce antinociception.16—18) The acetylcholine-induced constriction test has been used for screening analgesic compounds.19) In this model ()-spec- taline and LASSBio-776 similarly inhibited the constrictions by 44.7% and 47.9%, respectively, while LASSBio-755 showed a more important antinociceptive effect, inhibiting the constrictions by 82% (Fig. 5). These results in addition with the hot-plate test and the acetylcholinesterase in- hibition15) suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the antinociceptive response elicited by LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755. Taken together these results suggest differents mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio- 776 (3-O-Boc-spectaline) and LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl- spectaline), acting mainly by modulation of receptors located at central nervous system, and for ()-spectaline (LASSBio- 754) that showed to be a peripheral analgesic and anti-in- ﬂammatory agent. In conclusion, this study revealed new analgesic com- pounds derived from ()-spectaline without apparent toxic- ity and gave support to the strategy of modiﬁcations of iso- lated natural products from brazilian biodiversity seeking the optimization of the biological activities in the search of new drug candidates. Experimental Chemistry The natural alkaloids ()-spectaline (LASSBio-754) and ()-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) were obtained from the ethanolic extract of ﬂowers of Cassia spectabilis (DC.) IRWIN et BARN (Leguminosae), as previously described. 6,7) For the preparation of the target derivatives from ()-spectaline (LASS- Bio-754) the reaction sequences outlined in Chart 2 were followed. Reaction of LASSBio-754 with HCl under anhydrous conditions in CH2Cl2 yielded the hidrochloride LASSBio-768. Carbamate LASSBio-775 and carbonate LASSBio-776 were prepared, as a 1 : 2 mixture, by reaction of LASSBio- 754 with (BOC)2O/Et3N in CH2Cl2.20—22) Silyl ether LASSBio-777 was obtained by reaction of LASSBio-754 with tert-butyl dimethyl silyl triﬂate (TBSOTf)/2,6-lutidine in CH2Cl2.23,24) Treatment of carbonate LASSBio- 776 with BzCl/4-DMAP/Et3N25,26) and MsCl/Et3N in CH2Cl2 afforded N- benzoyl carbonate LASSBio-782 and N-methanesulfonyl carbonate LASS- Bio-821, respectively. Oxidation of LASSBio-754 under Jones conditions yielded the diketone LASSBio-766, that was subsequently reduced with LiAlH4 in THF to afford LASSBio-820. Reduction of LASSBio-754 with NaBH4 in MeOH furnished LASSBio-781, that differs from LASSBio-820 at the absolute conﬁguration on C-3. Finally, LASSBio-754 was converted into the oxime LASSBio-784 by reaction with NH2OH·HCl in pyridine/ EtOH.27,28) Melting points were determined with a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melt- ing point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were April 2008 409 Fig. 3.

Pharmacology Experiments were carried out in albino swiss mice (20—25 g) and rats (150—200 g) of both sexes from LASSBio (Faculty of Pharmacy, UFRJ, Brazil) breeding unit. All animals were kept in standard- ized conditions, maintained only with water ad libitum for 12 h before the experiment. Animal experiments were performed according to the “Princi- ples of Laboratory Animal Care and Use in Research” (Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal-COBEA/Instituto Brasileiro Carlos Chagas Filho-IBCCFO, Brazil), based on international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and ethical guidelines for investigation of experi- mental pain in conscious animals.29) All compounds were administered orally (0.1 ml/20 g) as a suspension in arabic gum (0.5% in saline) (vehicle) 1 h before the noxius stimulus. In- domethacin was used as standard. Results are expressed as meanS.E.M. of “n” animals per group and the activities expressed as percentage of inhibi- tion when compared with the vehicle control group. The data were statisti- cally analyzed by the Student’s t test for a signiﬁcance level of ∗p0.05. When appropriated, the ED50 values (i.e. the dose able to elicit 50% of the maximum effect observed) were determined by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software. Acetic Acid-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice The antinoci- ceptive activity was determined in vivo using the mouse abdominal constric- tion test induced by acetic acid 0.6% (0.1 ml/10 g; i.p.).9) Compounds and in- domethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Ten minutes after i.p. injection of the acetic acid the number of constrictions per animal was recorded for 20 min. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Acetylcholine-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice Constric- tions were induced by acetylcholine (4.0 mg/kg; i.p.) and the number of con- strictions per animal was recorded for 10 min.30) ()-Spectaline, LASSBio- 755 and LASSBio-776 were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Formalin-Induced Pain in Mice The formalin-induced pain test was carried out as described by Hunskaar and Hole.10) Animals were injected subplantarly with 20 ml of 2.5% formalin in hind paw. ()-Spectaline, LASSBio-755, LASSBio-776, indomethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. The time that mice spent licking or biting the injected paw or leg was recorded. Two distinct periods of intensive licking activity were identiﬁed and scored separately unless otherwise stated. The ﬁrst period (earlier or neurogenic phase) was recorded 0—5 min after formalin injection and the second period (later or inﬂammatory phase) was recorded 15— 30 min after injection. Anti-inﬂammatory Activity The anti-inﬂammatory activity was deter- mined in vivo using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test as previ- ously described.9) ()-Spectaline and indomethacin were administered at a range dose of 10—300 mmol/kg and 0.3—100 mmol/kg respectively, LASS- Bio-755 and LASSBio-776 at 100 mmol/kg. Animals were then injected subplantarly with either 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenan solution in saline (0.1 mg/paw) or sterile saline (NaCl 0.9%) into one of the hind paw, respec- tively. The paw volumes were measured using a glass plethysmometer cou- pled to a peristaltic pump, 3 h after the subplantar injection. The edema was calculated as the volume difference between the carrageenan and saline- treated paw. Hot-Plate Test Central analgesic activity was investigated using the hot plate test as described earlier.12) In these experiments, the hot plate apparatus (Ugo Basile, Model-DS 37) was maintained at 561 °C. Mice were placed on the heated surface and the time between placement and the ﬁrst sign of paw licking or jumping was recorded as latency. Latency was recorded at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral administration of vehicle, morphine (39.5 mmol/kg, used as positive control) or compounds (100 mmol/kg). The basal latencies were found to be 6—10 s. A cut-off time of 30 s was followed to prevent any injury to the paws.

In this context, some enzymes such as cyclooxygenases, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) have been widely rec- ognized as powerful targets for the action of anti-inﬂamma- tory agents.1—3) MPO is a leukocyte-derived heme peroxi- dase which has long been considered as a microbial enzyme centrally linked to the unspeciﬁc immune defense system. MPO plays an important role in oxidants production by poly- morphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). It uses hydrogen perox- ide (H2O2) and chloride gas to catalyze the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which contributes to both micro- bial killing, and subsequent oxidative injury of host tissue triggering severe inﬂammatory disorders,4) including rheuma- toid arthritis,5) inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD),6) cystic ﬁbrosis,7) neonatal lung injury,8) and adult respiratory distress syndrome.9) Thus, the search for new MPO inhibitors from natural sources can provide prototypes for the anti-inﬂamma- tory drug discovery, and design of novel therapeutic strate- gies. Pterogyne nitens TULASNE (Fabaceae) popularly known as “cocal”, “yvira-ró”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” is a highly branched and ca. 5—12 m high tree.10) Its wood is used for house building, for furniture and to make bows.11) In folk medicine, stem barks have been used as antiparasitic agent e.g., for treatment of ascariasis.12) As previously reported, the leaves of P. nitens yielded ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which ex- hibited cytotoxic activity against the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against to CHO Aux B1 cells.13) Preliminary study on additional bio- logical activities of P. nitens indicated a strong inhibition of rat paw edema suggesting the presence of anti-inﬂammatory compounds in its leaves EtOH extract which prompted us to investigate its chemical composition and evaluate the antioxi- dant and MPO inhibitory properties of the isolates. Experimental Plant Material Leaves of Pterogyne nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher speci- men (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Insti- tute (SP, Brazil). Isolation and Puriﬁcation The shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (1.8 l3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with ethanol (2.7 l3) at room temper- ature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-butanol. After solvent removal using a rotaevaporator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1—E11). Chromatographic puriﬁcation of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (46 : 53.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 10 ml/min] led to the isolation of compounds 1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (55 : 44.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 13 ml/min], afford- ing compound 3 (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identiﬁcation as compound 5 (130 mg). The butanol frac- tion (1.8 g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1—B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4—B6 were combined (333 mg) and pu- riﬁed by RP-HPLC (MeOH : H2O : AcOH (68 : 31.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm and ﬂow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds 2 (66 mg) and 4 (89 mg). Radical Scavenging Activity (RSA) Antioxidant activity of com- pounds 1—6 was determined using DPPH· (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS· [2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as- reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1—6 and positive controls at various con- centrations (33.3—1.7 mM) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 mM DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS· was pre- pared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mM) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1 : 0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12—16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS· stock solution was diluted with KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1 : 10 before use) buffer solution (ratio 1 : 88). ABTS· solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds 1—6 and positive controls (0.5—7.0 mg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical May 2008 723 Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory and Radical Scavenging Activities of Flavones from Pterogyne nitens Daniara Cristina FERNANDES,a Luis Octávio REGASINI,a José Carlos Rebuglio VELLOSA,b Patrícia Mendonça PAULETTI,a Ian CASTRO-GAMBOA,a Vanderlan Silva BOLZANI,a Olga Maria Mascarenhas OLIVEIRA,b and Dulce Helena Siqueira SILVA*,a a NuBBE-Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Department of Organic Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil: and b Department of Biochemistry and Chemical Technology, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil. Received December 22, 2007; accepted February 12, 2008; published online February 18, 2008 Two new ﬂavone glucosides, nitensosides A and B (1, 2), together with four known compounds, sorbifolin (3), sorbifolin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (4), pedalitin (5), and pedalitin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (6) were isolated from Pterogyne nitens. Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolu- tion mass spectrometry. All the isolated ﬂavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory ac- tivity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nM on MPO. Additionally, the radical- scavenging capacity of ﬂavones 1—6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox®.

Anti-radical abilities against ABTS· and DPPH· species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition[1(Asample/A)100], where A is test absorbance without sam- ple (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with com- pounds 1—6 or positive controls. Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity Inhibitory effects of 7-me- thoxyﬂavones 1—6 on MPO were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample con- centrations of compounds 1—6 (0.50—50 nM) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibi- tion expressed in concentration-response curves. Results and Discussion Nitensoside A (1) was obtained as yellow amorphous pow- der. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (a,b-unsaturated CO), 1606, 1502, 1452 (CC, aro- matic), and a broad band at 1160 cm1, indicating the pres- ence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These re- sults strongly suggested that compound 1 is a ﬂavonoid gly- coside.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two anomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at d 4.92 (1H, d, J7.0 Hz, H-1), d 4.45 (1H, d, J1.5 Hz, H-1), d 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a), d 3.70 (1H, dd, J10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b), and d 1.04 (1H, d, J6.0 Hz, H-6) suggested the presence of one b-glucopyranosyl and one a-rhamnopyranosyl unit in compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at d 102.4 (C-1), d 100.6 (C-1), d 66.6 (C-6) and d 17.7 (C-6). In the aromatic moiety of compound 1, signals at d 7.96 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-2, 6), 6.94 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-3, 5), 6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4-trihydroxy- ﬂavone).17,19) The singlet at d 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the ﬂavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR res- onance at d 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton signal at d 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.90, which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at d 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations conﬁrmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4-trihydroxy-7-methoxyﬂavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolinH] ion at m/z 301 observed in ﬁrst-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound 1.

Assignment of the inner sugar res- onances was achieved by using the anomeric proton reso- nance at d 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of 1H–1H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (J7.0 Hz) conﬁrmed the b-linkage of the ﬁrst glucosyl moiety. The downﬁeld shift of C-6 (5.5 ppm) and upﬁeld shift of C-5 (1.4 ppm) glucopyra- nosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin- 6-O-b-glucopyranoside,19) indicated that the rhamnopyra- nosyl moiety was attached at C-6. Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at d 100.6 (C-1) and d 3.70 (H-6) conﬁrmed the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage of compound 1. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound 1 showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [MH] at 607.1657 m/z, in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C28H31O15 (607.1657). Compound 2 was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 623.1600 (Calcd 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C28H31O16. The UV and IR spectra of 2 were similar to those of compound 1 suggesting a 6-O- glucosylﬂavone derivative. The IR of 2 showed a broad hy- droxyl band at 3427 cm1, and an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm1, in addition to a C–O stretching band at 1045 cm1, indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of 2 exhibited absorption maxima typical of a ﬂavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The 1H- and 13C-NMR data (Table 1) suggested that compound 2 had the same 7- methoxyﬂavone skeleton as compound 1, except for the pres- ence of a hydroxy group at C-3. In fact, the major difference between compounds 1 and 2 was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at d 7.42 (1H, dd, J8.5, 2.0 Hz, H-6), d 7.50 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz, H-2), and d 6.88 (1H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-5) for compound 2. The 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 2 presented 28 signals, deduced from distor- tionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90°, DEPT 135° and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, ﬁfteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quater- nary carbons, including one a,b-unsaturated ketone at d 182.1, which conﬁrmed the ﬂavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC cor- relation of signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.88 (OMe) in addition to NOESY interaction of signals at d 3.88 and d 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at d 128.0 (C-6) and d 4.89 (H-1), and between signals at d 66.5 (C-6) and d 4.43 (H-1) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage in compound 2. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures of ﬂavones 1 and 2 were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-O-a- rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyﬂavones were isolated and identiﬁed as sorbifolin (3),20) sorbifolin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (4),20) pedalitin (5),20) and pedalitin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (6).13) The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay.14,15) Pedalitin deriva- tives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin de- rivatives, probably due to presence of the ortho-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity.21,22) Pedalitin deriva- tives 2, 5 and 6 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC50 (mM) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC50 values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives 1, 3 and 4 (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the cathecol moi- ety on the B-ring of ﬂavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin de- rivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (5) when compared to its glucosides 2 and 6 in both assays, evi- dencing the inﬂuence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and there- fore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference com- pound quercetin (IC50 4.12 mM), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones.23) Similarly, this trend has also been ob- served for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC50 (5.7 mM to- wards ABTS, and 13.5 mM towards DPPH) than its 6-O-glu- cosyl derivatives 1 and 4, thus conﬁrming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi- calar activity of 7-methoxyﬂavones. Although a broad spectrum of the effects on mam- malian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids,24) few studies have been devoted to the MPO in- hibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols.25,26) MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modiﬁcations.16) The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds 2, 5 and 6, displaying a 3,4-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC50 values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1, 3 and 4, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohy- droxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides 1, 2, 4 and 6 showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between May 2008 725 Fig. 2. Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds 1 and 2 MPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inﬂammation derived diseases. Conclusion The association of antiradicalar properties and MPO in- hibitory activity observed for ﬂavones 1—6, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated ﬂavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inﬂammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme in- volved in inﬂammatory processes.

Naturforsch. 60b, 787 – 791 (2005); received September 17, 2004 The stems of Pilocarpus grandiﬂorus have afforded the new imidazole alkaloid 4,6-dehydro- 1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-2,5-dioxopilocarpine in addition to the 17 known compounds germanicol, β- amiryn, ocotillone, stigmast-4-en-3-one, 3β-hydroxy-stigmast-5-en-7-one, 6β-hydroxy-stigmast-4- en-3-one, β-sitosterol, scopoletin, 3-(1’,1’-dimethylallyl)-scopoletin, elisin, dictamine, 4-methoxy-2- quinolone, platydesmine, syringaresinol, syringaldehyde, syringic acid and vanillic acid. Their struc- tures were elucidated on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence. The phenolic compounds vanillic acid and syringaldehyde and the furoquinoline alkaloid platydesmine exhibited antifungal ac- tivity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, the symbiotic fungus of leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens rubropilosa). Key words: Pilocarpus grandiﬂorus, Jaborandi, Imidazole Alkaloid, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, Atta sexdens rubropilosa Introduction Pilocarpus commonly known as “Jaborandi” is a shrub belonging to the Rutaceae and comprises 16 neotropical species spread over tropical and subtrop- ical America. In Brazil, the occurrence of thirteen species [1] has been reported. This genus has long been known as the most important source of the imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine. Imidazole alkaloids are histamine derivatives found only in the genus Casimiroa and Pi- locarpus [2]. The alkaloid content in some Pilocar- pus (0.5– 1.0%) consists mainly of the imidazole alka- loid pilocarpine, together with small amounts of pilo- sine and related structures. Pilocarpine salts are valu- able in ophthalmic practice and used in eyedrops as miotics and for the treatment of glaucoma [3]. Leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyr- mex are among the most polyphagousagricultural pests of the South American countries. These ants cut veg- etables for substrate of their symbiotic food fungus and produce consistent economic damage to the harvesting of the cultivated plants. The agricultural pest control 0932–0776 / 05 / 0700–0787 $ 06.00 c⃝2005 Verlag der Zeitschrift f¨ur Naturforschung, T¨ubingen · http://znaturforsch.com practices generally involve toxic bait applications dam- aging the environment [4]. An alternative control for these insects can be achieved by inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus through more selective and less toxic natural products than the baits existent in the market. In this paper, we report the isolation of 18 com- pounds, the structural elucidation of a new imidazole alkaloid and the evaluation of their activities as in- hibitors of the growth of the symbiotic fungus Leuco- agaricus gongylophorus of leaf-cutting ants, Atta sex- dens rubropilosa. Results and Discussion In continuation of our search for compounds to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants [5 – 15], we have investigated the dichloromethane extract of the stems of P. grandiﬂorus leading to the isolation of a new imidazole alkaloid (1) in addition to the known compounds germanicol (2) [16], β-amiryn (3) [17], ocotillone (4) [18], β-sitosterol (5) [19], stigmast- Unauthenticated Download Date | 12/27/18 5:31 PM 788 R.

The known compounds were identiﬁed by compar- ison of their physical and spectral data with those al- ready reported in the literature. The new imidazole alkaloid had its structure determined on the basis of chemical and spectral evidence. The new alkaloid 1 had spectroscopic characteristics of the known imi- dazole alkaloid pilocarpine. The HREIMS spectrum displayed a molecular ion at m/z 238.0935 in accor- dance with the molecular formula C11H14O4N2. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals at δ = 1.01 (3H, t, J = 7.4 Hz), δ = 1.84 (1H, m) and δ = 1.38 (1H, m) indicating an ethyl group; two double- doublets at δ = 4.42 (1H, dd, J = 9.0, 5.4 Hz) and δ = 4.08 (1H, dd, J = 9.0, 2.0 Hz) for protons of oxy- genated carbons at δ = 71.7 and other lactone carbon at δ = 177.8 and the signals at δ = 2.67 (1H, ddd, J = 8.0, 7.0, 5.0 Hz), δ = 4.76 (1H, dddd, J = 11.5, 7.0, 5.4, 2.0 Hz) indicating a pattern similar to pi- locarpine. The 13C NMR spectrum for 1 (Table 1) showed eleven carbons in agreement with the imi- dazole alkaloid structure. The signals at δ = 177.7, 162.4, 152.4, 132.2 and 112.3 suggesting a change in the structure of pilocarpine with two additional car- bonyl groups and a double bond. The absence of a signal in the aromatic region and the signal at δ = 5.23 (1H, d, 11.0 Hz) in addition to the two carbonyl observed in the 13C NMR spectrum suggests a mod- iﬁcation of the imidazole ring. This is supported by HMBC spectrum (Table 2), which showed a correla- tion of the N-methyl group to the carbonyl C-2 and C-9 at δ = 152.4 (3J) and 162.4 (3J), and from H-6 to Table 2.

In the HSQC spectrum, the carbon at δ = 35.7 was cor- related with the signal at δ = 4.76. This value can be explained by anisotropic effects of the carbonyl group and the double bond. The G-NOESY experiments (Ta- ble 3) showed correlations of H-6 with the N-3-methyl group and H-8, requiring a cis conﬁguration for the double bond. The dichloromethane extract of the stems as well as fractions of P. grandiﬂorus showed strong inhibitory activity on the growth of L. gongylophorus. Among the 18 isolated compounds, the phenolic compounds syringaldehyde(10) and vanillic acid (12) and the furo- quinoline alkaloid platydesmine (18) exhibited higher inhibition of the fungal growth at 50 µg ml−1. Antifungal activities have been described for pheno- lic compounds against Cladosporium herbarum [33], Aspergillus ﬂavus and A. parasiticus [34], Geotrichum candidum, Coriolus versicolor, Phanerochaete chryso- sporium and Mycelia sterilia [35]. Grayer and Harbone [36] suggested that furoquino- line alkaloids might also play a role in the defense of plants against potentially pathogenic fungi.

Naturforsch. 57c, 418Ð422 (2002); received January 22/February 18, 2002 Tephrosia candida, Fabaceae, Spirorotenoids The ethyl acetate extract of roots of Tephrosia candida afforded three new spirorotenoids belonging to a new class of spirocompounds, named tephrospirolactone, tephrospiroketone I, and tephrospiroketone II. The structures of these compounds were determined mainly based on spectral analysis. The only known spirorotenoid described in the literature is amor- phispironone, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa. Introduction The genus Tephrosia belongs to the family Faba- ceae, which is well-known to be a rich source of flavonoids, besides the rotenoids among their sec- ondary metabolites. Rotenoids, an interesting class of compounds showing mainly activity against in- sects, have also shown powerful ictiotoxic activity, fish poison. Rotenone was the first rotenoid iden- tified and had been used as insecticide before the advent of the organosynthetic insecticides (Jacob- son, 1971). Recently, properties as anticarcino- genic activities have also been attributed to rote- noids. Tephrosin and amorphispironone (1) isolated from Amorpha species have shown a potential use against tumours including skin cancer (Konoshima et al., 1993 and Li et al., 1993). We have been interested in the chemistry of T. candida and have described the isolation of ro- tenoids from this plant (Andrei et al., 1997 and Pereira et al.,1998). In continuation of the study of the roots of T. candida we now describe the isola- tion and identification of three spirorotenoids, which represent a new spiroclass system formed by the rings B and C, a different spiro system type of amorphispironone, the only known spirorote- noid (Li et al.,1991).

Results and Discussion The infrared spectra showed absorption of car- bonyls at 1681, 1748 and 1675 cmÐ1, and 1716 cmÐ1 for 2 and 3 respectively. The absorption 1748 cmÐ1 was attributed to a carbonyl of an α,-dihydro-δ- lactone ring and the one 1716 cmÐ1 to the α,- dehydro-cyclopentanone, while absorptions close to 1680 cmÐ1, are usually observed for carbonyls of 6a, 12a-dihydrorotenoids The 1H NMR of the three compounds displayed an AB coupling system for two geminal hydro- gens, neighbouring the quaternary carbon of the Table I. 1H NMR data for spirocompounds (CDCl3, 400 MHz).

This system has never been observed before for any rotenoids. Other signals showed to be characteristic of hydrogens in the rings A, D and E, exhibiting differences of the chemical shifts, in comparison with deguelin (5) (Andrei et al. 1997) and rotenone (6) (Birch et al. 1985) as models. The chemical shifts observed for H-1 and H-4 in the ring A (Table I) exhibited ac- centuated differences indicating the presence of an electron withdrawing substituent at the aromatic system. The hydrogens in the D and E rings showed closer chemical shifts when compared with those of the above deguelin and rotenone. The pair of doublets attributed to H-6 in the spirocom- pounds showed similar chemical shifts with those of the homoisoflavanone scillascillin (7). The di- astereotopic protons of this compound (H-2) ap- pear as an AB system, displayed at δ 4.52 and 4.62 (J = 11.0 Hz) (Heller and Tamm, 1981). The 13C NMR chemical shifts were attributed to the carbons of compounds 1, 2 and 3, having rotenone (6) (Crombie et al., 1975) and deguelin (5) (Andrei et al.,1997) as models (Table II). The chemical shifts of C-6a and the additional carbonyl in C-12a of the new compounds have never been described for common rotenoid skeleta before. The data of Table II are in agreement with the proposed structures.

The HMBC spectrum of tephrospirolactone (2)(Table III) showed cross peaks between hy- drogens and carbons (2J and 3J) that confirmed the proposed structure. The main correlation was observed between C-6a and the diasterotopic hy- drogens at C-6. EI/MS also corroborated the structures pro- posed for the spirocompounds.

Mass spectrum of 3, also presented the base peak due to the only one retro Diels-Alder type fragmentation. Rotenoid biosynthesis is already well-known (Crombie, 1984 and Crombie and Whitting, 1998). These two last reviews show the main biosynthetic pathways. The biosynthetic pathway for amorphi- spironone 1, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa (Li et al., 1991; Terada et al.,1993) was discussed by Li (1991), and also mentioned by Crombie (1998). For the spiroketones 3 and 4, a similar first step mechanism with an epoxidation, like in amorphi- spironone, can be suggested. Therefore, the start- ing compound should be the 6a,12a-dehydrode- guelin. The epoxidation should occur between C-6a and C-12a. In a hydrate form at C-12 car- bonyl, a pinacol-pinacolone type rearrangement could lead to the spiro compounds, after intercon- version to the carbonylated form and oxidation of C-12a into a keto group. Subsequent oxidation by a Baeyer-Villiger reaction type at C-12 and expan- sion to a six membered lactone ring could explain the formation of the spirolactone 2.

Trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a compli- cated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoal agents.

Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy neces- sary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy- drogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of Trypanosoma cruzi catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphor- ylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bis- phosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD+ and in- organic phosphate. The in silico modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker et al., 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spermi- dine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb et al., 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the N1,N8-(bisglutathionyl)- spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S]2) to di- hydrotrypanothione (T[SH]2). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S]2) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against try- panosomatids (Hamilton et al., 2003). The genus Leishmania owns three enzymes in- volved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephos- phoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and α-d-5- phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into ad- enosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophos- phate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofura- nose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid se- quence when compared to corresponding mam- malian enzymes, which should allow the develop- ment of selective inhibitor compounds. In our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from T. cruzi or APRT enzyme from Leishmania tarentolae, were assessed. Materials and Methods Plant material Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae) and Sipho- neugena densiflora O.

T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activity The enzymatic activity of T. cruzi gGAPDH and the inhibitory activities of extracts and compounds against this enzyme have been determined accord- Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 375 ing to an earlier reported procedure (Vieira et al., 2001). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), i.e., the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentra- tions, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC50 = 55.5 μm). L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activity APRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier de- scribed procedures (Thiemann et al., 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectro- photometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propane- diol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 μL APRT so- lution. The reaction started by the addition of en- zyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira et al., 2001). T. cruzi TR inhibitory activity Enzyme activity and assay were performed ac- cording to prior descriptions (Hamilton et al., 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as posi- tive control [IC50 = 2.72 μm (personal communica- tion, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC50 value was deter- mined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Im- perial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC50 values, and the results were fitted into the equation Y = {Range/[1 + (X/IC50)s]} + Background, where Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in μm), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1). T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assay Bloodstream forms of T. brucei, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% se- rum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of T. brucei was evaluated using the Alamar Blue“ assay (Räz et al., 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 μm. T. cruzi cytotoxicity assay The assay was carried out using blood infected with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi “Y” strain col- lected by cardiac puncture in experimentally in- fected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal mu- rine blood to 2 · 106 trypomastigotes/mL. The as- say was performed in triplicate on titration micro- plates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or com- pounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL and 100 μg/ mL. The plates were incubated at 4 ∞C, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC50 = 31 μg/mL or 76 μm) were run in parallel. The re- sults were expressed as percentage of lysis of try- pomastigote forms compared to the DMSO con- trol. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.

The outcomes from triterpenes 4 (Table I), 24, 25 and 26 (Table II) point out a clear correlation between increasing number of hydroxy groups and higher activity, which justifies a meticulous investi- gation on structure-activity relationships in this case. All the substances tested against T. brucei were inactive, perhaps because of the low concentration (100 μm) tested in contrast to the concentration tested on T. cruzi (500 μg/mL, see Tables I and II). gGAPDH inhibition On the whole, 26 extracts and subfractions were tested. Eleven of them, the most polar (SD-metha- nolic and hydroalcoholic extracts), showed out- comes above 70% (Table III), and the majority belonged to S. densiflora (SD). The ascription of such activities to the hydrolysable tannins 11, 12, 13, and ellagic acid (9) may be considered due to the low IC50 values accomplished by these com- pounds (Table I).

Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 381 Among the flavonoids, the simple and highly oxidized flavonol quercetin (1) was the most ac- tive. The flavone luteolin (14), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduc- tion of the methoxy group at position C-3 (15) or C-3 (16), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested en- zymes (for comparison, see activities of com- pounds 17, 18 and 23 in Table II). The O-glycosyl- ated flavonol quercitrin (2) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone 1. Lio et al. (1985) ob- served the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activi- ties also performed by compounds 21 and 22 (Ta- ble II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I and II). An unseparated mix- ture of lupeol, α-amyrin and -amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from S. densiflora (SD-DML), tested at 200 μm, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentra- tion, a mixture of compound 24 and its isomer 2α,3-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound 24 inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II). APRT inhibition From 17 extracts and subfractions tested, eight presented results greater than 60%. Several could not be screened because they absorbed at the same wavelength used in the bioassay.

Furthermore, quercetin (1) as well as quercitrin (2), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD- EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had ac- tivities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I and II). When analyzing the results dis- played by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hy- droxy groups. Accordingly, compound 29, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to 28 and two in relation to 30, was twice more active than 28 and seven times more than 30 (Table II). TR inhibition All tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (11) and castalagin (12) which performed an IC50 value of 179.3 μm on enzyme inhibition, although this re- sult is not promising in comparison with clomi- pramine, the positive control.

In this context, endo- phytes belonging to the Penicillium genus have been recognized as a rich source of bioactive sec- ondary metabolites (Fill et al., 2007). Recent ex- amples include the anticancer berkelic acid from Penicillium sp., polyketides with HIV-integrase inhibitory activity from P. chrysogenum and the insecticidal paraherquamides H and I from P. clu- niae (Singh, 2003; Stierle et al., 2006). As part of our interest for bioactive metabo- lites from endophytes associated with Brazilian plants (Cafêu et al., 2005; Inácio et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2006; Teles et al., 2006), Alibertia macrophyl- la (Rubiaceae) was selected for our study, due to the fact that this species accumulates a series of bioactive compounds (Bolzani et al., 1991; Silva et al., 2007). Thus, the major aim of the current study was to identify potential bioactive compounds from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endo- phytes associated with A. macrophylla leaves, by using antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibi- tory assays. Material and Methods General 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the solvents as internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer in the ESI mode using MeOH/H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V).

Naturforsch. 64 c, 824 – 830 (2009); received June 29, 2009 In the course of our continuous search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi living in plants from the Brazilian ﬂ ora, leaves of Alibertia macrophylla (Rubiaceae) were submitted to isolation of endophytes, and two species of Penicillium were isolated. The ac- etonitrile fraction obtained in corn from a culture of Penicillium sp.1 afforded orcinol (1). On the other hand, Penicillium sp.1 cultivated in potato-dextrose-broth furnished two differ- ent compounds, cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val) (2) and uracil (3). The chromatographic fractionation of the acetonitrile fraction obtained from Penicillium sp.2 led to three dihydroisocoumarins, 4-hydroxymellein (4), 8-methoxymellein (5) and 5-hydroxymellein (6). Compounds 5 and 6 were obtained from the Penicillium genus for the ﬁ rst time. Additionally, metabolites 1 – 6 were evaluated for their antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. The most active compounds 1 and 4 exhibited detection limits of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 2 showed a detection limit of 10.0 μg, displaying potent AChE inhibitory activity.

Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde/H2SO4 reagent fol- lowed by heating at 120 ºC. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 preparative column (250 mm × 21.2 mm). Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 instrument using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230 – 400 mesh (Merck). Plant material Authenticated Alibertia macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) was collected in Estação Ecológica Experimental de Mogi-Guaçu, Fazenda Campin- inha, Mogi-Guaçu, São Paulo, Brazil, in Novem- ber 2003. The botanical identiﬁ cation was made by Ph.D. Maria Cláudia Marx Young (Institute of Botany, São Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher speci- men was deposited at the Herbarium of the Bo- tanic Garden of São Paulo, Brazil (voucher no. SP 370915). Isolation and identiﬁ cation of the endophytes For isolation of the endophytic fungi, adult and healthy leaves of A. macrophylla were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. They were ﬁ rst washed with water and soap, and then im- mersed in an 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁ nally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. Sterilized leaves were cut into 2 × 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthramicine sulfate (50 mg/mL) with approx. 3 to 4 pieces on each dish (Silva et al., 2006). The endophytic fungi were identiﬁ ed according to the characteristics of morphology of the cul- ture and spores, mechanism of spore production, and molecular taxonomy according to a modi- ﬁ cation of the rapid preparation of DNA from ﬁ lamentous fungi (Raeder and Broda, 1985). The fungi were identiﬁ ed by Ph.D. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Plu- ridisciplinar de Pesquisas Químicas, Biológicas e Agrícolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in our collection with culture numbers 05070032-C and 05-070032-A for Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, respectively. Preparation of the crude extract in corn and potato-dextrose-broth of Penicillium sp.1 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cool, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d. After the incubation period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6 × 250 mL); after that the solvent was evaporated, providing the crude MeOH extract (10.6 g). The methanol extract was dissolved in water and then subjected to liquid-liquid partition with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was suspended in acetonitrile and parti- tioned with hexane. Evaporation of the organic phase resulted in the crude acetonitrile extract (804 mg). The fungus was cultivated using potato-dex- trose-broth (PDB) as culture medium (4.0 g of potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/L H2O). For the PDB, 20 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) were used, each containing 100 mg of potato extract, 5.0 g dextrose and 250 mL distilled water, which were autoclaved at 125 °C for 15 min. Approx. 10 small pieces (1 cm2) of PDA medium from the Petri dish containing biomass of Penicillium sp.1 were inoc- ulated into each ﬂ ask, and the ﬂ asks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After in- cubation for 28 d at 25 °C on rotatory shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂ asks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁ ltration, and the ﬁ ltrate was partitioned with EtOAc (3 × 2.5 L). Collection and evaporation of the organic phase under reduced pressure yielded a brown, solid residue (507 mg). Preparation of the crude extract in corn of Penicillium sp.2 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cooling, the media were inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d.

Antifungal activity Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Institute of Botany, São Paulo, Brazil. Compounds 1 – 6 were applied on precoated silica gel TLC plates using a solu- tion (10 μL) containing 100, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.00 and 1.00 μg of each. After eluting with adequate solvent they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahali- son et al., 1991). Nystatin was adopted as positive control.

TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol), in order to wash them, and were thoroughly dried just before use. After migration of the sample in a suitable solvent (or direct deposition of sam- ple), the TLC plate was dried for complete re- moval of the solvent. The plate was then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and thoroughly dried again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was laid ﬂ at on plastic plugs in a plastic tank con- taining a little bit of water; by this means, water did not come directly into contact with the plate but the atmosphere was kept humid. The cover was placed on the tank and incubation was per- formed at 37 °C for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After in- cubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the 1-naph- thyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple colouration after 1 – 2 min. Galanthamine was employed as positive control (Marston et al., 2002). Results and Discussion The molecular structures of all isolates (Fig. 1) were conﬁ rmed by the MS and NMR data as shown below. Assignments were based on 2D- NMR experiments including gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC. Compound 1 was isolated as a brown amor- phous powder and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C7H8O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 123). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic signals, δH 5.99 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-6) and δH 6.01 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H, H-2 and H-4) suggesting a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o spectra showed ﬁ ve signals, assigned to one oxygenated aromatic groups at δC 158.1 (C-1 and C-5), two methines attributed to signals at δC 99.7 (C-6) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4) and one methyl group at δC 21.1 (C-7). The position of the methyl substituent at position C-3 was at- tributed on the basis on the gHMBC experiment, which indicates a correlation of δH 2.43 (H-7) with δC 138.9 (C-3) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4). This data suggests that 1 is orcinol (Monde, 1998). Compound 2 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecular formula C10H16N2O2 ([M+H]+ at m/z 197). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed signals at δH 0.86 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-11), δH 1.02 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12), δH 4.12 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-6), and δH 3.92 (brs, 1H, H-9). Also, three mul- tiplets at δH 3.40 (2H, H-3), 1.78 (2H, H-4), and 2.13 (2H, H-5) were observed. Analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum indicated two methyl groups, three methylene carbon atoms and three methine carbon atoms. The signals at δC 170.2 and δC 165.2 were attributed to two amide carbonyl groups at C-7 and C-1, respectively, and 1H NMR signals of an amino acid suggested that 2 belongs to the diketopiperazine class. The gHMBC cross-peaks between the signal for C-1 and the signals for H-3, H-6, H-9, and H-10, as well as the signal for C-7 and the signals for H-5, H-6, and H-9 conﬁ rmed that 2 was biosynthesized by condensation of the amino acids proline and valine. The interpretation of these results combined with comparison with literature data (Furtado et al., 2005) suggest that diketopiperazine 2 is cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val). Compound 3 was isolated as yellow amorphous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecu- lar formula C4H4N2O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 111). The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 appeared to be relatively simple, exhibiting two doublets at δH 5.41 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-5) and δH 7.38 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H, H-6). The 13C NMR spectrum showed only four signals, for two carbonyl groups [δC 151.9 (C-2) and δC 164.4 (C-4)] and two methines [δC 99.9 (C- 5) and δC 142.9 (C-6)]. These data indicate that 3 is uracil (Schindler, 1998; Martin et al., 2007). Fig. 1. Chemical structures of compounds 1 – 6 isolated from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2.

Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecu- lar formula C10H10O4 ([M+Na]+ at m/z 217). The 1H NMR spectrum showed doublets for three ar- omatic protons at δH 6.86 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-5), δH 6.96 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-7) and δH 7.45 (dd, J = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, 1H, H-6). Altogether these signals suggest that 4 presented a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The gCOSY cross-peaks of the doublet at δH 1.51 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-9) coupled to a methine hydrogen atom with a signal at δH 4.63 (dq, J = 6.5, 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-3) in turn coupled to a methine hydrogen atom at δH 4.50 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-4), suggesting an α-methylhydroxy unit in the molec- ular structure of 4. The broad singlet at δH 11.0 (1H) indicated the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a hydroxy group (8-OH) and a carbonyl group (C-1). The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o spectra showed the presence of ten signals, assigned to one methyl [δC 16.0 (C-9)], ﬁ ve methine groups [δC 78.1 (C-3), δC 67.2 (C-4), δC 118.5 (C-5), δC 136.7 (C-6), δC 118.2 (C-7)], and three aromatic quaternary carbon atoms [δC 162.1 (C-8), δC 106.8 (C-8a), δC 140.5 (C-4a)], and one signal at δC 169.1 (C-1), which was attributed to a carbonyl group, suggesting that 4 is an dihydro- isocoumarin. This information coupled to data of the literature (Holler et al., 1999) assigne 4 to the structure of 4-hydroxymellein. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C11H12O3 ([M+H]+ at m/z 193). In particular, a high similarity between the NMR spectral data of compounds 5 and 4 was observed. The major difference was identiﬁ ed in the chemi- cal shifts attributed to H-4 of 5, which showed a multiplet at δH 2.80 (2H, H-4). Furthermore, the presence of a singlet at δH 3.88 (3H, H-10) sug- gested a methoxy substituent. A gHMBC correla- tion was observed between the signal at δC 161.2 (C-8) and H-10, which conﬁ rmed the position of the methoxy group at C-8. This information cou- pled to literature data (Kamisuki, 2007) assigne 5 to the structure of 8-methoxymellein. The dihydroisocoumarin 6 was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data in- dicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M–H]– at m/z 193). Considering differences in the NMR spectral data between compounds 5 and 6, the 1H NMR spectrum of 6 exhibited two ortho-coupled hydrogen atoms at δH 6.73 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-7) and δH 6.92 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-6), suggesting a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and DEPT 135o data indicated signals at δC 156.5 and δC 143.0, which where attributed to the hydroxy- lated aromatic carbon atoms C-8 and C-5, respec- tively. These data indicate a hydroquinone ring in the molecular structure of 6, which was identiﬁ ed as 5-hydroxymellein (Harwood, 1984). Compounds 1 – 6 were evaluated for their an- tifungal activity against Cladosporium cladospo- rioides and C. sphaerospermum using a direct bioautography assay (Table I). The most active compounds, orcinol (1) and 4-hydroxymellein (4), showed a potent effect towards the yeasts, exhib- iting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, re- spectively. 5 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity to- wards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 μg, re- Table I.

Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes 829 spectively. 5-Hydroxymellein (6) proved to be not potent, since the content at which this compound showed activity was 50 μg. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydro- isocoumarins and free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8. The identiﬁ cation of the compounds 1, 4 and 5, potentially bioactive against the phytopatho- genic fungi, indicates that they act as defence of the host species against possible attacks of patho- gens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for compounds isolated from Penicillium, few stud- ies have been devoted to the acetylcholineste- rase (AChE) inhibitory activity. AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to terminate the impulse-transmitted action through cholinergic synapses (Stryer, 1995; Sigurdsson and Gudbjar- nason, 2007). Although the fundamental reason of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not clear so far, AD is ﬁ rmly associated with impairment in the cholinergic transmission. A number of AChE in- hibitors have been considered as candidates for the symptomatic treatment of AD as the most useful relieving strategy (Barbosa-Filho et al., 2006; Alarcón et al., 2008). The diketopiperazine 2 exhibited the highest AChE inhibitory activity displaying a detection limit of 10.0 μg (Table I). Compounds 1 and 3 showed a detection limit of 60 μg, which was considered as weakly potent. The dihydroisocoumarin 4 displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 30.0 μg. On the other hand, compounds 5 and 6 were not active (detection limits over 100 μg). Similar to the observed antifungal activ- ity, free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8 corrobo- rate to increase the anti-AChE potency presented by dihydroisocoumarins. In conclusion, six metabolites from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endophytes associ- ated with A. macrophylla leaves, exhibited poten- tial bioactivity, including antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results suggest that com- pounds 2 and 4 should be considered further in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for the use in the drug design for Alzheimer’s disease treatment.

Among the plant families studied, Meliaceae and Ruta- ceae are perhaps the most promising (Schoon- hoven, 1982), at least partly due to the presence of limonoids and triterpenoids characteristic of the Rutales order. The biological activity of limo- noids from Rutales has been reviewed (Cham- pagne et al., 1992). Some neem-based botanical insecticides have already been developed and marketed (Schmutterer, 1990, 1995, 2005). Carapa guianensis Aublet, also called andiroba, andiroba-saruva, iandirova, carapá, and nandiro- ba (Lorenzi and Matos, 2002), is a tall Meliaceae tree growing wild throughout South America, West India, and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in ﬂ ooded areas of the Ama- zon rainforest (Ambrozin et al., 2006). From the nuts of this plant an oil, called andiroba oil, is ex- tracted, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, as analgesic, anti-inﬂ ammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and as an anticancer remedy (Bickii et al., 2000; Gilbert et al., 1999; MacKinnon et al., 1997; Moura et al., 2002). Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, together with 2 – 5% of unsaponiﬁ able material. In addi- tion, from several parts of Carapa guianensis li- monoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, ﬂ avo- noids, and diglycerides have been isolated (Lavie et al., 1973; Marcelle and Moto, 1975; Ollis et al., 1964, 1970; Qi et al., 2003, 2004). Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae) (“canjarana”) is a native tree of economic impor- tance in Brazil. It is a dioecious tree with wide- spread distribution in the neotropics, extending from Costa Rica to southern Brazil and northern Argentina. According to Pennington et al. (1981), it inhabits mainly nonﬂ ooded evergreen lowland or lower hill rain forests. In the present paper, triterpenoids and limo- noids isolated from C. canjerana and C. guianensis were examined for their effects on the fall army- worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepi- doptera: Noctuidae). S. frugiperda is a major pest of many crops in the Americas and one of the most important pests of tropical maize, causing up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity of this crop in Brazil (Cruz et al., 1996).

Gedunin was used as a positive control. 7-Deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and β-photogedunin reduced the pupal weight as occurred with gedunin. Cabraleadiol, 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide, and 7-deacetoxy-7-oxoge- dunin prolonged the larval phase similar to the control (gedunin) of approximately 1.2 days at 50.0 mg kg–1.

D. Pennington from the Royal Bo- tanic Garden, Kew, UK. A voucher (1842; 1983) is deposited in the herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestal Dendrologia, Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The arillus of the Carapa guianensis seeds were supplied by Cognis Brasil Ltda., Av. Nações Uni- das 10989, 4° andar, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds isolation Fruits (460 g) and seeds (200 g) from C. can- jerana were extracted with ethanol, at room tem- perature for three times. The ethanolic extract (88.3 g) of the fruits was submitted to liquid-liquid partition with 120 ml methanol/water (3:1, v/v) solution. This solution was partitioned with dif- ferent solvents to give fractions in n-hexane (fr- Hex, 47.4 g), dichloromethane (fr-CH2Cl2, 5.4 g), ethyl acetate (fr-EtOAc, 4.4 g), and methanol (fr- MeOH, 11.9 g). The fraction fr-Hex (2.8 g) was submitted to a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 45 fractions of 50 ml) using n- hexane/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase, yielding nine fractions (fr-Hex.1 to fr-Hex.10) after TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2 (102 mg) was re- chromatographed by column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20 as stationary phase (col- umn 3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., 26 fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol/dichloromethane, 1:1, v/v), yielding three fractions (fr-Hex.2.1 to fr- Hex.2.3) after comparison by TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2.2 (88.6 mg) was rechromato- graphed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 3.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 10 fractions of 5 ml each) eluted with n-hexane/acetone (9:1, v/v) to afford ocotil- lone (1, 16.3 mg) and cabraleadiol (2, 24.4 mg). The ethanolic extract (14.3 g) of the seeds of C. canjerana was chromatographed on microcry- stalline cellulose-D and silica gel (column 5.0 x 22.0 cm i.d., fractions of 250 ml each) using n-hex- ane (250 ml) followed by dichloromethane (1 l), acetone (1 l), and methanol (1 l) as mobile phas- es yielding 13 fractions (EES-1 to EES-13). The fraction EES-2 (1.72 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 69 fractions of 10 ml each) using n-hexane/ acetone/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase to yield eleven fractions (EES-2.1 to EES- 2.11) which were joined based on TLC. The frac- tion EES-2.6 (293.4 mg) was rechromatographed by column chromatography using a Sephadex LH- 20 column (3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol), yielding ﬁ fteen fractions (EES-2.6.1 to EES-2.6.15). The fraction EES-2.6.7 afforded methyl angolensate (3, 48.2 mg). The fraction EES-2.7 (230.6 mg) was re- chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 35 fractions of 10 ml each), using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as mobile isocratic phase, yielding seventeen fractions (EES- 2.7.1 to EES-2.7.17). The fraction EES-2.7.9 af- forded 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide (4, 63.7 mg). The arillus ethanolic extract (10.0 g) of C. gui- anensis was submitted to vacuum chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase (70 – 230 mesh, column 30 x 5 cm i.d.) and n-hexane followed by CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH (1 l each) as mobile phases, yielding four fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (3.8 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica gel (230 – 400 mesh, 30 x 4 cm i.d., n-hexane and acetone gradient as elu- ent, starting with pure n-hexane and ﬁ nishing with pure acetone, 32 fractions of 200 ml each) to give ﬁ ve fractions (Ac1 to Ac5). The fraction Ac3 (3.0 g) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 10 x 3 cm i.d.) eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2 to MeOH, 28 frac- tions of 50 ml each) to yield ten fractions (Ac3.1 to Ac3.10). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5, 24.4 mg) and β-photogedunin (6, 14.4 mg) were isolated from fraction Ac3.2 by recycling HPLC (Asahipack polymeric column; eluent, methanol/ dichloromethane, 7:3, v/v; ﬂ ow, 4 ml min–1). Biological activity Larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Labora- tory of Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil, and reared on semi-artiﬁ cial diets (Kasten et al., 1978; Parra, 1986). They were maintained in an incubation chamber with a pho- toperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark, (70 5)% rela- tive humidity, and (25 1) °C. For each treatment and control, 30 neonate larvae of S. frugiperda were used. A solution of compound was added to ascorbic acid (1.56 g; an Unauthenticated Download Date | 9/2/15 2:05 PM A. L. F. Sarria et al. · Triterpenoids and Limonoids against Spodoptera frugiperda 247 ingredient of the diet). After evaporation of the solvent, the mixture was incorporated into the semi-artiﬁ cial diet in which bean and wheat germ are the basic ingredients (Kasten et al., 1978) at ﬁ nal contents of 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg kg–1 for 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), and 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg–1 for ocotillone (1), cabraleadiol (2), methyl angolensate (3), 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide (4), and β-photogedunin (6). The diet for the con- trol was prepared similarly but without the tri- terpenoids or limonoids. Gedunin (7) was used as positive control. The diets were placed in previously sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm × 2.5 cm), into which larvae of S. frugiperda were introduced individu- ally. The pupae were weighed 1 d after pupation and were transferred to plastics cups, where they stayed until the emergence of adults. Daily obser- vations were made and the following parameters were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal phases, (2) weight of pupae, and (3) percentage of dead insects (mortality) at the end of each phase. Statistics Data were submitted to an analysis of variance ANOVA (Zar, 1974), and the averages were com- pared applying the Tukey test (P 0.05). Each tube containing one insect, independent of the developed phase, was considered as one replicate, therefore, the number of replicates was different for each treatment. For evaluation of the mortal- ity of the larvae and pupae, the experimental unit was constituted by the mean of ﬁ ve tubes contain- ing one larva each, with six replications by treat- ment. Results and Discussion The triterpenoids 1 and 2 and limonoids 3 and 4 were isolated from the fruits and seeds of C. canjerana and the limonoids 5 and 6 from the aril- lus of C. guianensis (Fig. 1). Their structures were conﬁ rmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and comparison with data from the literature (Braga et al., 2006; Ambrozin et al., 2006). Compounds 1 – 6 were incorporated in the semi-artiﬁ cial diet. 2, 4, and 5 affected larval de- velopment (Table I), and only 6 affected pupal development at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg [(8.5 1.64) days and (8.9 1.25) days, respec- tively, control (10.1 1.45) days]. Larvae fed with Fig. 1.

Larvae fed with semi-artiﬁ cial diet treated with 2, 4, and 5 at 50.0 mg kg–1 prolonged the larval time for approximately 1.2 days similar to gedun- in, suggesting that these compounds act as larval growth inhibitors (Table I). Compounds 2 and 4 prolonged the larval phase, although no alteration in pupal weight was ob- served. Tanzubil and McCaffery (1990) observed that larvae treated with low doses of azadirachtin produced pupae with a weight comparable to that of the controls, suggesting that they did not expe- rience any severe feeding inhibition. Compound 5 also effected prolongation of the larval phase followed by reduction of the pupal weight. The larvae treated with 5 showed prolonga- tion of the larval phase by 1.4 days (at 50.0 mg kg–1) and 2.6 days (at 100.0 mg kg–1) when compared with the control (14.9 days, Table I). The reduction of the pupal weight was by 17.8 and 25.8 mg at 50.0 and 100.0 mg kg–1, respectively, when compared with the control (262.5 mg, Table I). Larvae treated with 6 at 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg–1 presented reduction of the pupal weight by 30.0, 31.1, and 31.5 mg, respectively, when com- pared with the control (272.7 mg, Table I). This compound reduced the duration of the pupal phase by 1.2 days and that of the larval phase was increased by 0.6 days, while gedunin affected Table I.

Ocotillone (1) isolated from the leaves of Dysoxylum malabaricum (Govindachari et al., 1994) was tested against Spodoptera litura and showed excellent PFI (percentage feeding in- dex) values comparable to those of azadiradione, epoxyazadiradione, and limonin (Govindachari et al., 1995). Methyl angolensate (3) exhibited insecticidal activity against S. litura in no-choice tests (Ab- delgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh et al., 2002; Powel et al., 1991), and this result agrees with that observed in the present work. Isolated from diethyl ether and acetone extracts of the stem bark of Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) 3 showed antifeedant activity by the conventional leaf disc method on the third-instar larvae of Spodop- tera littoralis (Boisd., Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at 500 μg ml–1 (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh et al., 2002) in a study examining struc- ture-insect antifeedant relationships of plants belonging to the Rutales order. In a dual-choice antifeedant bioassay against Spodoptera litura L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), methyl angolensate (3) showed a PFI of 65.3, near to that of cedrelone (51.5). Two limonoids (sandoricin and 6-hydroxy- sandoricin) isolated from seed extracts of Sando- ricum koetjape Merr. (Meliaceae), which possess chemical structures similar to that of methyl an- golensate (3), showed signiﬁ cant antifeedant ac- tivity against the fall armyworm (S. frugiperda), incorporated in diet at 25 ppm, and similar activ- ity against the European corn borer (ECB), Os- trinia nubilalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), at 200 ppm. Toxicity results for both insects indi- cated that continued feeding on diets containing sandoricin or 6-hydroxysandoricin at the 200 ppm level would result in nearly 100% mortality prior to pupation (Powell et al., 1991). β-Photogedunin (6) presented the highest in- secticidal activity against S. frugiperda causing mortality of 53.3% in the larval stage and 20.0% in the pupal phase at 50 ppm. These results agree with those of Céspedes et al. (2000), who tested an epimeric mixture of photogedunin and their corresponding acetates and observed that these compounds caused signiﬁ cant mortality of S. fru- giperda larvae (45% to 100% at 10.0 to 52.0 ppm) after 7 days, as well as growth reduction, and pho- togedunin acetates showed the highest insecticid- al activity at 10.0 ppm with 17% survival. Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 6 showed moderate in- secticidal activity at 50.0 mg kg-1 with 40.0, 40.0, 33.3, and 53.3% mortality, respectively, for the lar- val phase. Although the compounds tested here were less active than the positive the control ge- dunin (7, 63.3%), the use of these compounds, in particular 6, is suggested for the control of S. frugiperda. Comparison of the activities of 6 and 7 suggests that oxidation of the furan ring led to a decrease in the insecticidal activity.

Many substances of vegetal origin can be toxic or present an insecticidal potential. With the aim of decreasing the environment pollution problem, a few studies are trying to substitute synthetic insecticides with botanical ones. Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae) presents a great variety of substances, being the ricinine the main toxic component. Considering that bees are useful as pollinator agents of plants, this study evaluates toxicity potential of ricinine on workers and larvae of Apis mellifera (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hymenoptera, Apidae) and Scaptotrigona postica (Latreille, 1907) (Hymenoptera, Meliponini). In order to determine ricinine toxicity, ingestion tests were carried out with isolated workers bees that received ricinine on its diet. Furthermore, for topic tests, solutions of ricinine in methanol were applied on pronotum of worker bees with an “Agla” brand micrometer syringe outfit. For larvae of bees, ingestion tests were used and mortality rates were calculated. According to the results, it was detected a significant toxic activity (p < 0.0001) of ricinine on the workers of the two bee species at concentrations of 0.1% in the ingestion tests and 0.2% in the topic tests. For all concentrations (0.25%, 0.5% and 1%), a high percentage of larvae bees was negatively affected by ricinine on the first days of life. KEYWORDS. Ricinus communis, Apis mellifera, Scaptotrigona postica, topic test, ingestion test. RESUMO. Muitas substâncias de origem vegetal podem ser tóxicas ou apresentar potencial inseticida. Com o objetivo de diminuir a problemática da poluição ambiental alguns estudos vêm tentando substituir os inseticidas artificiais pelos inseticidas botânicos. Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae) apresenta uma grande variedade de substâncias sendo a ricinina o principal componente tóxico. Considerando que as abelhas são insetos benéficos por atuarem como agentes polinizadores das plantas, este estudo teve por objetivo avaliar o efeito tóxico da ricinina para as operárias e larvas de Apis mellifera (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hymenoptera, Apidae) e Scaptotrigona postica (Latreille, 1907) (Hymenoptera, Meliponini). Para isso, foram realizados testes de ingestão em operárias confinadas recebendo ricinina incorporada à dieta e testes de aplicação tópica com a substância solubilizada em metanol e aplicada no pronoto das abelhas com auxílio de uma microseringa. Para as larvas foram realizados testes de ingestão e calculada sua taxa de mortalidade. Os resultados mostram atividade tóxica significativa (p < 0.0001) da ricinina nas abelhas adultas das duas espécies para a concentração 0,1% nos testes de ingestão e 0,2% nos testes de aplicação tópica. Outrossim, uma elevada porcentagem de larvas foi afetada negativamente pela ricinina logo nos primeiros dias de vida para todas as concentrações testadas (0,25%, 0,5% e 1%). PALAVRAS-CHAVE. Ricinus communis, Apis mellifera, Scaptotrigona postica, teste de aplicação tópica, teste de ingestão. Apesar da grande importância dos insetos como polinizadores de muitas espécies vegetais, existem aqueles considerados fitófagos. Em resposta, algumas plantas são capazes de fornecer substâncias que podem provocar a morte dos insetos, havendo as que apenas os afugentam e outras que tem a particularidade de capturar e digeri-los. Assim, pesquisadores vêm se interessando pelos efeitos das substâncias derivadas das plantas no controle de insetos que são considerados pragas, podendo também afetar espécies de insetos benéficos, como os polinizadores (RAMOS et al., 2003). TRIGO & SANTOS (2000) estudaram a mortalidade de insetos em flores de Spathodea campanulata (Bignoniaceae), marcando os botões florais um dia antes da antese. Em seguida, contaram e identificaram os insetos mortos a cada 24 horas, até 5 dias após a antese. Em 445 flores examinadas foram encontrados 345 insetos mortos, na maioria abelhas da tribo Meliponini. Em bioensaios laboratoriais, a mucilagem pura coletada de botões florais e a mucilagem na concentração de 25% foram avaliadas em abelhas Scaptotrigona postica (Latreille, 1807) (Meliponini) recém-emergidas. Os resultados mostraram uma redução da longevidade das recém-nascidas de 52,9% para a concentração de 25% e de 95,2% para a mucilagem pura. CARVALHO & MESSAGE (2004) realizaram um estudo utilizando o ácido tânico na alimentação de larvas de abelhas e verificaram que este causou sintomas semelhantes aos provocados pela doença denominada “cria ensacada brasileira”, que se caracteriza por apresentar mudanças de coloração, interrompimento dos ínstares larvais e quando as larvas parecem estar dentro de sacos. O estudo foi realizado devido a grande quantidade de tanino observada em uma das variedades do barbatimão, o Stryphnodendron polyphyllum (Leguminosae). Atualmente, são freqüentes os estudos de biopesticidas na tentativa de diminuir o impacto ecológico que os pesticidas químicos vêem causando no meio ambiente. MIRANDA et al. (2003) avaliaram a 62 Iheringia, Sér. Zool., Porto Alegre, 99(1):61-65, 30 de março de 2009 ROTHER et al. susceptibilidade da amida pelitorina, isolado de Piper tuberculatum (Piperaceae), para as abelhas Apis mellifera (Linnaeus, 1758) através de testes de ingestão e de contato. As larvas mostraram-se mais suscetíveis à amida pelitorina em relação às operárias recém-emergidas. SINGARAVELAN et al. (2006) em estudos dos efeitos dos componentes secundários do néctar das flores Nicotiana spp. (Solanaceae) sobre colônias de A. mellifera, observaram que a presença de nicotina extraídas dessas flores não afetou a sobrevivência das abelhas adultas e causou mortalidade somente nas larvas e em concentrações elevadas (50 ppm). No Brasil, estudos realizados com duas espécies de barbatimão, Dimorphandra mollis (Leguminosae) e Stryphnodendron adstringens (Leguminosae) mostraram atividade tóxica do macerado de suas flores desidratadas quando adicionadas à dieta das abelhas (CINTRA et al., 2003). A caracterização de aleloquímicos com propriedades antialimentares e repelentes utilizados pelas plantas como defesa vem se constituindo como mais um avanço em estudos desta natureza (PIZZAMIGLO, 1991). CINTRA et al. (2002), por exemplo, trabalharam com extratos metanólicos das flores e pedúnculos de D. mollis e isolaram o flavonóide astilbina, mostrando que essa substância era causa de mortalidade para as abelhas. Com metodologia idêntica, SOUZA et al. (2006) mostraram que os extratos metanólicos e diclorometano dos pedúnculos e inflorescências de S. adstringens tiveram um efeito tóxico para as operárias de A. mellifera e abelhas nativas (S. postica). Dentre os grupos de insetos, em Apoidea estão os mais importantes polinizadores de plantas nativas e cultivadas (KEVAN & BAKER, 1983). De modo geral, as abelhas são totalmente dependentes das flores para obtenção de pólen, néctar, óleos, fragrâncias e outros recursos, utilizados tanto pelos adultos quanto por suas larvas. Estes recursos são obtidos por diferentes espécies de abelhas que forrageiam em horários diferentes e/ou concentram-se em certas espécies de plantas. Além disso, algumas espécies de abelhas também utilizam as flores como um local de abrigo, repouso ou acasalamento (PEDRO & CAMARGO, 1991). No Brasil, há a perspectiva de se ampliar as plantações de mamona (Ricinus communis, Euphorbiaceae) (CONAB, 2006) como forma alternativa de produção de combustível e de se utilizar a ricinina como inseticida no controle de insetos pragas, sendo de fundamental importância a realização de estudos sobre o efeito da ricinina, em espécies não alvo. Diante desse contexto, este estudo visa verificar os possíveis efeitos da ricinina, substância extraída das folhas de mamona, sobre operárias e larvas de duas espécies de abelhas sociais, importantes polinizadoras. MATERIAL E MÉTODOS Obtenção do extrato foliar bruto. Folhas de R. communis coletadas no Jardim Experimental do Campus da UNESP - Rio Claro foram secas em estufa por 48 h a 40oC, trituradas em moinho tipo Wiley e transportadas para o laboratório de Produtos Naturais da Universidade Federal de São Carlos, UFSCar. A matéria seca, moída e com massa de 3,5 kg foi submetida à percolação em recipiente de cinco litros por sete dias com diclorometano à temperatura ambiente, em repouso. Após filtração, o concentrado obtido em evaporador rotativo foi de 380g de extrato bruto. Fracionamento químico de extrato foliar bruto e identificação do princípio ativo. O isolamento de ricinina a partir do extrato diclorometânico das folhas foi realizado através de cromatografia contracorrente de alta velocidade (HSCCC) a partir de 1,5 g do extrato bruto conforme LEITE et al. (2005). A ricinina foi obtida na forma pura nas frações 35-49 (209 mg). Os solventes empregados no fracionamento foram comerciais destilados no Departamento de Química – UFSCar. A identificação do princípio ativo foi realizada através de análises espectroscópicas por ressonância magnética nuclear de hidrogênio e carbono 13 (RMN 1H e 13C), infravermelho e espectrometria de massas (EM) (BIGI et al., 2004). Abelhas. Foram utilizadas abelhas adultas e larvas de A. mellifera e S. postica, provenientes do apiário do Instituto de Biociências da UNESP - Rio Claro. Abelhas adultas recém-emergidas de A. mellifera foram coletadas nos favos, utilizando sua coloração e tamanho para a identificação. Já para S. postica, os favos de cria coletados nos ninhos foram colocados em bandejas plásticas de 55 cm x 45 cm x 10 cm (com paredes revestidas de fluon - resina de fluoroetireno - para evitar fugas) com alimento (cândi) e água, para que as operárias emergissem em um intervalo de 24 horas. Testes de ingestão. Os testes com larvas foram realizados seguindo VANDENBERG & SHIMANUKI (1987). O alimento foi depositado no fundo dos alvéolos durante cinco dias, recebendo em cada um deles 4, 15, 25, 50, 75 μl de alimento, respectivamente. A dieta foi preparada com 10g de geléia real, 7,4 ml de água destilada, 1,4 g de D-glicose, 1,4 g de D-frutose e 0,2 g extrato de levedo para os experimentos com A. mellifera, onde foi incorporada a ricinina nas concentrações de 0,25%, 0,5% e 1%. Para S. postica a dieta foi preparada a partir de 10 g de pólen, 5 g de mel e 5,4 ml de água destilada, nas mesmas concentrações propostas anteriormente. As larvas de S. postica foram alimentadas apenas no primeiro dia com uma dieta de 36 μl. Os alvéolos contendo as larvas foram colocados em placas de Petri e observados diariamente sob lupa. As alterações de coloração e alterações no desenvolvimento foram registrados assim como o número de indivíduos mortos, no período de 24 e 48 horas. Para os testes com operárias, a ricinina foi incorporada à dieta e oferecida às abelhas nas concentrações 0,02%, 0,05% e 0,1%. Para A. mellifera utilizou-se o cândi como dieta artificial (açúcar confeiteiro e mel, na proporção de 5:1) e para S. postica foi ministrado pólen previamente retirado dos reservatórios do ninho e conservado em geladeira. O alimento preparado foi oferecido em tampas plásticas de 2,8 cm de diâmetro, recoberta por uma tela de arame a fim de evitar contaminação por contato. Os grupos experimentais e controle receberam os mesmos suprimentos de água através de algodão embebido em água. As abelhas foram acondicionadas em três caixas de madeira (20 abelhas por caixa) de 11 cm de comprimento x 11 cm de largura x 7 cm de altura, forradas com papel-filtro. 63 Iheringia, Sér. Zool., Porto Alegre, 99(1):61-65, 30 de março de 2009 Suscetibilidade de operárias e larvas de abelhas sociais em relação... Os testes foram conduzidos em estufa B.O.D, com temperatura a 34 ± 1 °C e umidade acima de 80% para as larvas de A. mellifera e 28 ± 1 °C e umidade acima de 70% para S. postica. Para as operárias de A. mellifera a temperatura foi de 32 ± 1 °C e para S. postica, 28 ± 1 °C, ambas em umidade relativa de 70%. Testes de aplicação tópica em operárias. A ricinina foi adicionada a 1 ml do solvente metanol, nas soluções de concentração 5, 10 e 20 mg de ricinina por ml de metanol. Para cada abelha adicionou-se 1 μl da solução correspondente (0,005; 0,01 ou 0,02 mg/μl) na região do pronoto com o auxílio de uma microseringa adaptada a um micrômetro e um capilar de vidro. Após a aplicação, as abelhas permaneceram por quinze minutos em uma bandeja plástica para a evaporação do solvente e foram retiradas e distribuídas nas caixas de madeira. Foi utilizado um controle sem solvente (SS) e outro com solvente (S). A cada 24 horas a mortalidade foi observada. Análise estatística. Para os experimentos de ingestão e de aplicação tópica foram calculadas as taxas de sobrevivência a cada 24 horas, durante 25 dias, no Software GraphPad Prism 2.01. Posteriormente, foi aplicado o teste não-paramétrico Log Rank Test (MOTULSKY, 1995), para comparar as curvas de sobrevivência. Para os testes de ingestão foi calculada a porcentagem de larvas sobreviventes em 24 e 48 horas. RESULTADOS Os resultados indicam efeito tóxico nas concentrações 0,05% e 0,1% para os testes de ingestão realizados com operárias de A. mellifera. Para a concentração 0,02% os resultados indicam ausência de toxicidade dessa substância (Tab. I). Em S. postica foi observado efeito tóxico da ricinina quando presente na dieta na concentração 0,1% (Tab. II). Para os testes de aplicação tópica, os resultados foram significativos apenas na concentração de 0,02% (20 mg.ml-1) em ambas as espécies de abelhas (Tabs. III, IV). Larvas de A. mellifera e de S. postica apresentaram suscetibilidade à ricinina nas três concentrações adicionadas à dieta de operária (0,25; 0,5 e 1,0%) 24 horas após o início dos bioensaios (Tabs. V, VI). DISCUSSÃO Os experimentos mostraram que a ricinina reduziu a taxa de sobrevivência das abelhas tratadas. Em trabalho semelhante, BIGI et al. (2004) realizaram tratamentos de ingestão de ricinina em formigas cortadeiras Atta sexdens (Linnaeus, 1758), nos quais verificaram sintomas de intoxicação após 24 horas da ingestão. Ao contrário do obtido para abelhas, os resultados para este estudo com formigas indicaram efeito significativo na mortalidade para concentrações menores (0,02% ou 0,2 mg.ml-1 e 0,04% ou 0,4 mg.ml-1), principalmente a partir do 4° dia de experimento. CINTRA et al. (2003) mostraram o efeito tóxico dos extratos metanólicos de D. mollis (falso-barbatimão) para operárias de A. mellifera. Posteriormente estes foram fracionados e foi isolada a substância astilbina, com uma elevada mortalidade de A. mellifera (CINTRA et al., 2005). Em acréscimo, KITAMURA et al. (1999) verificaram que a menor concentração tóxica da ricinina para operárias de formigas A. sexdens foi 0,005% (0,05 mg.ml-1). Aquele resultado quando comparado com os obtidos para as duas espécies de abelhas (A. mellifera, 0,05% e 0,1%; S. postica, 0,1%) denota uma toxicidade maior da ricinina para as formigas, visto que esta substância reduziu a sobrevivência daqueles insetos mesmo quando administrada em menor concentração. As abelhas das duas espécies tratadas com ricinina em testes de ingestão mostraram sintomas de intoxicação como lentidão dos movimentos, falta de orientação, tremor das pernas, paralisia e morte. Esses sintomas foram variáveis entre as abelhas e dependentes da concentração de ricinina na dieta. Sintomas semelhantes de intoxicação foram observados por BUSOLI et al. (1992) em formigueiro de campo de Atta capiguara (Gonçalves, 1944) tratados com diflubenzuron e MirexR com 0,45% de dodecacloro. SOUZA et al. (2006) em estudo com abelhas adultas de A. mellifera e S. postica tratadas com extratos foliares de Stryphnodendron adstringens também verificaram comportamento similar. Tabela I.

Os resultados obtidos nos experimentos com larvas de A. mellifera e S. postica de 24 e 48 horas de idade, utilizando-se três concentrações diferentes de ricinina (0,25; 0,5 e 1,0%) adicionada à dieta de operária mostraram efeitos tóxicos já em 24 horas para estas espécies. De maneira semelhante, CARVALHO & MESSAGE (2004) estudaram a toxicidade do pólen de Stryphnodendron polyphyllum para larvas de A. mellifera. Além de verificar o efeito tóxico, os resultados mostraram que o pólen desta planta provoca, nas larvas, sintomas semelhantes à “cria ensacada brasileira”, com mudanças na coloração e interrompendo os instares larvais no período de pupa. A ricinina apresentou toxicidade semelhante a Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, inibindo o crescimento e evolução do primeiro instar larval e alterando a coloração do branco para amarelado. Comparando-se os resultados do presente estudo com resultados da literatura, é possível sugerir que a ricinina é uma substância de origem vegetal tóxica para insetos. BIGI et al. (2004) sugeriram que a ricinina deve ser aplicada diretamente nos ninhos das formigas como iscas granuladas a fim de se evitar possível contaminação de outros insetos por contato ou por ingestão. Assim, constatou-se a atividade tóxica de ricinina para duas espécies de abelha. Por conseguinte, para se conservar a interação entre abelhas e plantas é necessário que se evite o contato das mesmas com estas iscas ou com outras formas de aplicação de ricinina para controle de insetos pragas.

Bioactivity- guided fractionation from hexane extract of Himatanthus sucuuba barks utilizing Cladosporium sphaerospermum led to the isolation of iridoids plumericin and isoplumericin, which showed higher inhibition against C. sphaerospermum than the antibiotic nistatin. Besides bioactive iridoids were isolated the inactive triterpenes lupeol cinnamate, ααααα-amyrin cinnamate and lupeol acetate. Keywords: Himatanthus sucuuba; iridoids; triterpenes. ARTIGO INTRODUÇÃO Himatanthus sucuuba (Spruce) Woodson (Apocynaceae) é uma planta conhecida na região norte do Brasil como sucuuba, janaguba ou sucuba. Esta planta é amplamente utilizada na medicina popular como antitumoral, antifúngica, vermífuga e anti-anêmica1. Estudos anteriores revelaram a presença de depsídeos, terpenos e iridóides em H.sucuuba2,3. Dentre os iridóides foram encontra- dos a fulvoplumierina, isoplumericina e plumericina, de compro- vada ação antineoplásica, antiflogística e antimicrobiana4-10. Os depsídeos isolados de H.sucuuba apresentaram atividade como inibidores da enzima beta monoamino-oxidase (MAO-B)3. No entanto, como foram encontrados nas cascas podem não ser pro- venientes da planta e sim de líquens infestantes. No presente trabalho são descritos os resultados do estudo fitoquímico do extrato hexânico das cascas do caule de H.sucuuba. Este extrato é constituído basicamente por uma mistura de ésteres triterpênicos, que corresponde aproximada- mente a 7% do peso do extrato. Estes ésteres triterpênicos já foram descritos no gênero Himatanthus11,12. A atividade fungicida apresentada pelo extrato foi monitorada por bioauto- grafia, utilizando-se o fungo fitopatogênico Cladosporium spha- erospermum13-14. A análise das frações bioativas por CGAR- EM, RMN 1H e 13C revelou a presença dos iridóides plumeri- cina 1 e isoplumericina 2. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O extrato hexânico das cascas do caule foi submetido a bioautografia, utilizando o fungo Cladosporium sphaerosper- mum. A cromatoplaca de sílica foi eluída com uma mistura de hexano e acetato de etila (6:4). Uma zona de inibição intensa na cromatoplaca indicou a presença de substâncias fungitóxicas. O extrato hexânico foi fracionado em coluna de SEPHADEX- LH 20, usando hexano, diclorometano, acetona e metanol como eluentes. Das oito frações obtidas, a segunda e a terceira frações apresentaram zona de inibição na bioautografia. A cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria de massas destas duas frações mostrou a presença dos iridóides plumericina 1, isoplumericina 2, e de uma mistura de ésteres triterpênicos das séries lupano e ursano, como constituintes em maior proporção na mistura. Ao extrato hexânico dissolvido em clorofórmio adicionou- se etanol. Este procedimento levou à obtenção de um sólido amorfo que foi cromatografado em coluna de gel de sílica. A eluição da coluna com uma mistura de hexano/benzeno em gradiente de polaridade crescente forneceu uma mistura de duas substâncias e um sólido cristalino. A análise da mistura, por cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria massas, mos- trou o mesmo íon molecular de m/z 556 para as duas substân- cias, compatível com a fórmula molecular C39H56O2. Foram observados íons característicos de triterpenos das séries lupano de m/z 189 (32%) e ∆12 -urseno ou oleaneno de m/z 218 (46%), este último proveniente de um rearranjo de tipo retro- Diels- Alder15-16. O íon de m/z 408 (M+•-148), resultante da perda de C9H8O2 , acompanhado do fragmento de m/z 131 (100%) leva- ram a suposição da presença de um grupamento cinamoíla no esqueleto triterpênico17-18. Os espectros de RMN 13C (desacoplado e DEPT 90o e 135o) da mistura registraram os pares de deslocamentos químicos 124.5 (CH) e 139.8 (C), e 109.6 (CH2) e 151,1 (C), característicos para as ligações duplas C(12) - C(13) da série urseno e C(20)- C(29) do grupo isopropilideno do esqueleto lupano19-20, respec- tivamente. A unidade cinamoila foi confirmada através dos des- locamentos químicos em δ 128,2 (C-2’ e C-6’), 129,0 (C-3’e C- 5’), 130,3 (C-4’) e 134,3 (C-1’) do anel aromático e em 119,0, 144,4 e 166,3 da unidade (CH=CH-COO). O par de dubletos no RMN 1H em δ 7,70 (1H, J=16Hz) e 6,48 (1H, J=16 Hz) e 7,65 (1H, J=16Hz); e 6,42 (1H, J=16 Hz.) mostram que a ligação dupla tem configuração E21-22. A hidrólise básica desta mistura levou a obtenção de ácido cinâmico, lupeol e α-amirina23, cujas as estruturas foram confirmadas através de seus espectros de massas (CGAR-EM) e co-injeção com padrões. O sólido cristalino 5 mostrou o íon molecular de m/z 468, compatível com a fórmula molecular C32H52O2, e fragmentos no espectro de massas característicos do esqueleto lupano19-21,24-26. A unidade acetil foi caracterizada pelos espectros de RMN 1H e 13C de 519-21, 24-26, que foi identificado como acetato de lupeol. O fracionamento guiado por bioensaio das frações bioativas levou à obtenção de uma mistura dos iridóides 1 e 2. A análise QUÍMICA NOVA, 21(6) (1998) 703 por CGAR-EM mostrou que ambos os iridóides tem o mesmo peso molecular (M+• 290, C15H14O6). Os fragmentos de m/z 258 (M+•-32, 42%) e de m/z 230 (M+•-60, 85%) são provenientes da perda de MeOH e de formiato de metila, enquanto o de m/z 193 (M+•-97, 78%) é resultante da perda do anel da lactona. O espectro de RMN 1H desta mistura registrou um par de dubletos de quartetos em δ 7,14 (1H, J=1,0 e 7,0 Hz) e 6,80 (1H, J=1,0 e 7,0 Hz), que foram atribuídos ao hidrogênio olefínico no C-13 da plumericina 1 e isoplumericina 2, respectivamente. A avaliação biológica foi feita utilizando a suspensão de esporos do fungo fitopatogênico Cladosporium sphaerospermum. Pelo método da autobiografia utilizando diferentes concentra- ções das substâncias 1 e 2 , verificou-se que o limite de deteção, tanto para plumericina 1 quanto para isoplumericina 2 está abai- xo de 1µg. Este resultado indica uma atividade fungitóxica para estes iridóides cinco vezes maior do que o observado para o antibiótico nistatina (5µg), usado como padrão. foi tratado com clorofórmio e etanol, precipitando 2,0 g de um sólido branco amorfo. 200 mg deste sólido foram cromatografa- dos em coluna de gel de sílica (hexano/benzeno em gradiente crescente de polaridade), fornecendo uma mistura constituída de 3 e 4 (58,8 mg) e um sólido 5 (25,2 mg). 6,0 g da fração hexânica bruta foram ainda cromatografados em coluna aberta utilizando SEPHADEX LH-20 (60 g) como fase estacionária e como eluentes hexano, diclorometano, acetona e metanol em gradiente de polaridade crescente fornecendo: (A) C6H14 (5,0 g); (B) C6H14:CH2Cl2 (8:2; m=0,5 g); (C) C6H14:CH2Cl2 (6:4; m=0,3 g); (D) C6H14:CH2Cl2 (2:8; m=0,05 g); (E) CH2Cl2:C3H6O (8:2; m=0,08 g); (F) CH2Cl2:C3H6O (6:4; m=0,03 g); (G) CH2Cl2:C3H6O (2:8; m=0,008 g); (H) MeOH (m=0,002 g). A cromatografia em camada fina das frações obtidas indi- cou a presença de substâncias com o mesmo Rf nas frações B e C. Estas frações foram reunidas (m=0,8 g) e cromatografadas em coluna de gel de sílica tendo como eluentes hexano, diclo- rometano, acetato de etila e metanol em gradiente de eluição. Após a bioautografia das frações (vide procedimento abaixo), a fração eluída com CH2Cl2:AcOEt (8:2,108 mg) foi cromato- grafada em coluna de gel de sílica com hexano/acetato de etila em gradiente de eluição, obtendo-se oito frações das quais a fração eluída com C6H14 : AcOEt (7:3) é uma mistura consti- tuída pelos iridóides 1 e 2 (16,3 mg). Hidrólise da mistura de 3 e 4 - 45 mg deste material foram refluxados com 6 ml de solução metanólica de KOH a 5% em 60 ml de hexano. Após evaporação do metanol e adição de água, extraiu-se a solução com clorofórmio, obtendo-se uma fração insaponificável, que foi identificada por co-injeção em CGAR como lupeol e α-amirina. A fração aquosa alcalina acidificada com HCl e extraída com acetato de etila forneceu um sólido cristalino que foi identificado por comparação com amostra autêntica, através de CCD, IV e co-injeção em CGAR, como o ácido cinâmico. Bioensaio - A análise do extrato hexânico foi realizada em cromatografia de camada fina, tendo como sistema de solven- tes hexano:acetato de etila (6:4).Após o registro das bandas cromatográficas que absorveram na luz ultravioleta, fez-se a aplicação da suspensão, contendo Cladosporium sphaerospermum, sobre a cromatoplaca com subsequente deposição em atmosfera úmida para incubação por um período de dois a três dias. Suspensão de Cladosporium sphaerospermum - Uma solu- ção contendo KH2PO4 (7 g), Na2HPO4. 2H2O (3 g), KNO3 (4 g), MgSO4. 7H2O (1 g) foi autoclavada a 120oC por 20 minu- tos. A 60 ml desta solução foram adicionados 10 ml de uma solução de glicose a 30% e, em seguida, adicionou-se o fungo Cladosporium sphaerospermum até obter-se uma suspensão.

Chemical investigation of the leaves of Styrax camporum (Styracaceae) resulted in the isolation of the lignan lariciresinol and six triterpenes: ursolic acid, 2,3-dihydroxy-urs-12-en-28- oic acid and mixtures of uvaol and erythrodiol, as well as 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-2-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid and 3b-O- trans-p-coumaroylmaslinic acid. The structures of these compounds were established by spectroscopic analysis. This paper deals with the first report of these compounds in S. camporum. Keywords: Styrax camporum; Styracaceae; triterpenes. INTRODUÇÃO Styracaceae inclui espécies de plantas predominantemente arbóreas,1 distribuídas em áreas distintas do continente americano, sudoeste da Ásia e região mediterrânea2. Nas Américas, ocorre des- de a região central dos Estados Unidos até o norte da Argentina. A família é bastante conhecida pela produção de resinas balsâmicas cujo nome genérico é benjoin, sendo o ácido benzóico o constituinte predominante das mesmas3,4. Na indústria de perfumes e cosméti- cos, o benjoim é a matéria prima principal para a obtenção do ácido benzóico; na medicina tradicional, devido às suas propriedades expectorantes é utilizado como coadjuvante para inalação das vias respiratórias. Nas cerimônias religiosas da antiguidade foi muito apreciado como defumatório, pelos sacerdotes hebreus e da Índia 3,4. Styrax camporum Pohl é conhecida pela população brasileira como “benjoeiro”, “cuia-do-brejo”, “canela-poca”, “fruta-de-pom- ba” e “pinduíba”. A planta adulta pode atingir uma altura média de 6-10 m e diâmetro do tronco de 30-40 cm. No Brasil, ocorre nos cerrados de Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul e Paraná na floresta semidecídua da bacia do Paraná5. Dados fitoquímicos de espécies de Styrax registram a ocorrência de lignanas, norlignanas6-15 e triterpenos15-18 como constituintes pre- dominantes no gênero. Em ensaios preliminares, visando a detecção de atividade antitumoral, o extrato bruto das folhas dessa planta apre- sentou atividade inibidora do crescimento de linhagens mutantes de Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Rad+, Rad 52Y e RS 321) que perderam a capacidade de regenerar o DNA. O presente trabalho descreve o isolamento de uma lignana e seis triterpenos pentacíclicos inéditos para o gênero. Para um deles, o ácido 2,3-diidroxi-urs-12-en-28- óico, foi observada atividade inibidora seletiva da linhagem 52Y de S. cerevisiae, indicando ação específica no DNA. A norlignana egonol, já relatada para a espécie19, também foi isolada. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO Investigação fitoquímica das folhas de Styrax camporum Pohl resultou no isolamento do lignóide lariciresinol (1) e de seis triterpenóides: ácido ursólico (2), ácido 2,3-diidroxi-urs-12-en- 28-óico (3) e as misturas de uvaol (4) e eritrodiol (5) bem como as do ácido 3-O-trans-p-cumaroil-2-hidroxi-urs-12-en-28-óico (6) e ácido 3-O-trans-p-cumaroil-maslínico (7). As substâncias 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 e 7 estão sendo identificadas pela primeira vez neste gênero. As estruturas destas substâncias foram elucidadas a partir dos dados obtidos por análises espectroscópicas de RMN 1H e 13C, expe- rimentos DEPT 90° e 135°, COSY , IV e EM. Comparação dos re- gistros na literatura para as substâncias obtidas neste estudo foram fundamentais para a confirmação de suas estruturas moleculares e atribuições de suas estereoquímicas relativas. Os espectros de RMN 1H e RMN 13C, experimento COSY 1H - 1H e EM-ES permitiram identificar a substância 1 como sendo o (+)- lariciresinol ([]D 25 = + 8,89o )20-22. Análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiram identifi- car a estrutura do triterpeno 2 como o ácido ursólico23,24. O triterpeno 3 apresentou bandas em 3400 (OH) e 1700 cm-1 (carbonila) no espectro de IV. O espectro de RMN de 1H de 3 mos- trou sinais em 5,20 (1H, t, J= 3,5 Hz, H-12), característicos de hidrogênio olefínico, em 3,90 (1H, m, H-2) e 3,36 (1H, sl, H-3) relativos aos hidrogênios carbinólicos, além de sinais em 0,72-1,25 e 1,34-2,34 , que foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios metílicos, metilênicos e metínicos, respectivamente. Exame dos dados de RMN 350 Quim. Nova Pauletti et al. 13C (Tabela 1) permitiram definir o esqueleto de um triterpeno do tipo ursano, principalmente pela presença dos sinais em 124,7 d e 138,0 d relativos à ligação dupla entre os C-12 e C-13. Entre outros, os sinais em 65,6 e 78,2 correspondem a dois carbonos hidroximetínicos em C-2 e C-3. A comparação dos dados de RMN de 13C de 3 com os valores registrados na literatura, levaram a con- cluir que a substância 3 é o ácido 2, 3-diidroxi-urs-12-en-28-óico23. O espectro de RMN de 1H de 4 e 5 permitiu a visualização de sinais em 5,13 (1H, t, J = 3,5 Hz, H-12) e 5,07 (1H, t, J = 3,5 Hz, H-12), característicos de hidrogênios olefínicos de triterpenos, em 3,14 (4H, dd, J = 11,0 Hz e 3,7 Hz, H-28) e 3,48 (2H , dd, Ja-a= 10,8 Hz e Ja-e= 4,2 Hz, H-3) relativos aos hidrogênios carbinólicos. Observaram-se também duas regiões espectrais muito complexas em 0,73 - 1,25 , com sinais que foram atribuídos a grupos metílicos e em 1,32-1,82 que correspondem a hidrogênios metilenicos e metínicos. Os pares de sinais de RMN 13C (Tabela 1) em 125,0 e 138,7 e em 122,3 e 144,2 , característicos de carbonos olefínicos, confirmaram a presença de uma mistura de triterpenos ursano e oleano. Análise dos dados de RMN de 13C e comparação de dados da literatura para substâncias análogas 23,25,26 levaram a concluir que a mistura é formada pelos triterpenos uvaol e eritrodiol. O espectro de RMN de 1H de 6 e 7 apresentou sinais em 7,65 (1H, d, J = 16,0 Hz, H-7’), 7,40 (2H, d, J = 7,4 Hz, H-2’ e H-6’), 6,85 (2H, d, J = 7,4 Hz, H-3’ e H-5’), 6,33 (1H, d, J = 16,0 Hz, H-8’), relativos a hidrogênios aromáticos pertencentes a uma unida- de p-cumaroíla. Os demais sinais em 5,20 (1H, sl, H-12) caracte- rísticos de hidrogênio olefínico e vários sinais entre 0,83 - 1,94 indicaram a natureza triterpênica desta substância. O sinal em 4,63 (1H, d, Ja-a = 9,9 Hz, H-3) foi atribuído ao H-3 e encontra-se mais desblindado devido à esterificação com o ácido p-cumárico. Os si- nais do espectro de RMN 13C (Tabela 1) em 125,3 , 138,1 , em 121,9 e 143,8 , característicos de ligações duplas, confirmaram a Tabela 1.

Aos carbonos C-2 e C-3 foram atribuídos os valores de 66,0 e 84,1 , respectivamente. A fórmula molecular C39H54O6 foi confirmada pe- los dados de RMN 13C e EM-ES. O espectro de massas apresentou os seguintes picos: m/z 658 [M+K+H]+ (22%), m/z 642 [M+Na+H]+(100), íon RDA: m/z 247 (15%), m/z 203 (33%), m/z 164 (4%), m/z 147 (63%) e m/z 119 (25%). Essas informações permitiram identificar 6 e 7 como o ácido 3- O-trans-p-cumaroil-2-hidroxi-urs-12-en-28-óico e ácido 3-O- trans-p-cumaroil-maslínico 23, 27. A norlignana com atividade antifúngica, 5-(3”-hidroxifenil)-2- (3´,4´-metilenodioxifenil)-7-metoxibenzofurano, conhecida como egonol, foi identificada através da comparação de seus espectros de RMN com aqueles obtidos para uma amostra autêntica 15. Pesquisa bibliográfica sobre a constituição química de Styracaceae revelou a presença marcante de arilpropanóides monoméricos, lignóides 6-15 e triterpenóides 15-18 . O gênero Styrax , o mais importante da família e com maior volume de informações, caracteriza-se pelo acúmulo de norlignóides do tipo benzofurânicos, uma vez que os mesmos foram isolados em todas as espécies do gênero investigadas até o momento . A presença de triterpenos do tipo oleanano e ursano em S. officinalis 16 e S. japonica 17-18 não se configura como um dado químico relevante para análise quimio- taxonômica, devido à baixa variabilidade estrutural observada para estes metabólitos encontrados nas duas espécies acima menciona- das, assim como à baixa ocorrência dos mesmos nos táxons afins estudados. As substâncias 1-7 foram ensaiadas nas três linhagens mutantes de Saccharomyces cerevisiae sendo que o triterpeno 3 apresentou ini- bição moderada do crescimento da linhagem 52Y. Embora a atividade observada para 3 seja fraca, ela foi seletiva para um dos mutantes de- ficientes nas vias de reparo de DNA, indicando especificidade sobre o mesmo 28. Outro dado bastante significativo deste resultado é que este é o primeiro registro da atividade de triterpenos sobre o reparo de DNA. Os demais triterpenos isolados mostraram-se inativos PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentação e material cromatográfico Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em CDCl3, DMSO-d6 e piridina-d5 no espectrômetro Bruker Ac-200 F operando a 200 MHz para 1H e 50 MHz para 13C, respectivamente, usando TMS como padrão de referência. Os experimentos de COSY, DEPT 90o e 135o foram realizados em espectrômetro Bruker Ac-200 F. O espectro de absorção no IV foi obtido no espectrômetro PERKIN ELMER- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa resolução FISONS- Modelo VG Platfform II, no modo Eletrospray. Nas análises por CCDC e CCDP foram utilizadas placas de sílica gel 60 G F254 . As placas foram observadas sob luz UV 254 - 366 nm (Chromatovus) e reveladas com vapores de iodo ressublimado e solução de anisaldeído seguido de aquecimento. Nas cromatografias em coluna foram utili- zadas sílica gel 60 G 230 - 400 e 70 - 230 mesh. A atividade óptica foi medida no Polamat A (Carlzeiss Jena). Material vegetal A espécie vegetal Styrax camporum Pohl foi coletada na Esta- ção Ecológica e Experimental de Mogi-Guaçú-SP em dezembro de 1997. A exsicata do material vegetal encontra-se depositada no Herbário do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente de São Paulo-SP. Bioensaio Para a detecção de atividade antitumoral em extratos e substân- cias puras, foram utilizadas três linhagens mutantes de Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( rad+, 52Y e RS321) segundo a metodologia descrita na literatura28. Extração As folhas de S. camporum (1770,30 g) foram secas, pulveriza- das e extraídas exaustivamente com etanol, à temperatura ambiente. Após a remoção do solvente sob vácuo, foram obtidos 404,27 g do extrato bruto etanólico. Este foi solubilizado em CH3OH : H2O (8:2) e extraído sucessivamente com hexano, CHCl3 e AcOEt. Após a con- centração dos solventes, cada extrato originou 3,36 g, 16,8 g e 28,86 g, respectivamente. O resíduo CHCl3 (16,8 g) foi fracionado em uma coluna de sílica gel eluída com : Hexano; Hexano:CHCl3 (1:1); CHCl3; AcOEt:CHCl3 (1:1); AcOEt; CH3OH:AcOEt (1:1) e CH3OH. Desta coluna resulta- ram 10 subfrações. A subfração 3 (4,68 g) foi submetida a uma coluna de sílica gel 60 G empregando gradiente de CH2Cl2:CH3OH. Desta coluna foram separadas 7 subfrações. A subfração 3.4 (2,68 g) foi recromatografada em coluna de sílica gel 60 G usando gradiente de CH2Cl2:CH3OH, fornecendo 17 subfrações. A subfração 3.4 (4-6) (389,7 mg) foi fracionada em coluna de sílica gel 60 G usando gradiente de CH2Cl2:CH3OH. Desta coluna resultaram 33 subfrações. A subfração 3-9 (202,9 mg) foi fracionada em coluna de sílica gel 60 G usando gradiente de Hexano:CHCl3:AcOEt (9:1). Assim, foram obtidas 39 subfrações, sendo que da subfração 24-28 foram isoladas as subs- tâncias 4 e 5 (33,6 mg) e da subfração 29-30, egonol (19,8 mg). Da subfração 3.4 (10) (127,3 mg) foi isolada a substância 2 (42,3 mg), após lavagem com CH3OH. A subfração 3.4 (17) (304,0 mg) foi fracionada em coluna de sílica gel 60 G usando gradiente de Hexano:CHCl3:AcOEt (9:1). Desta coluna foram obtidas 17 subfrações. A subfração 2-4 (211,9 mg) foi fracionada em coluna de sílica gel 60 G usando gradiente de CH2Cl2:CH3OH. Esta coluna forneceu 55 subfrações. Da subfração 41-47 (38,2 mg) foram isola- das as substâncias 6 e 7 e da subfração 38-40 (53,5 mg) foi identificada a substância 3, após coluna de sílica gel 60 G usando gradiente de CH2Cl2:CH3OH na subfração 26-27 (32,4 mg). A fração 4 (1,33 g) foi submetida a uma coluna cromatográfica usando sílica gel 60 G e gradiente de CH2Cl2:CH3OH como eluente em ordem crescente de polaridade. Foram obtidas 47 subfrações. A substância 1 foi isolada da subfração 4 (26-29), após coluna de Sephadex LH-20 utilizando CH3OH como eluente.

The bioactive compound trans-3’-methylsulphonylallyl trans-cinnamate (1) along with the inactives iryelliptin (2) and (7R,8S,1’S)-∆8’-3’,5’-dimethoxy-1’,4’-dihydro-4’-oxo-7.0.2’,8.1’-neolignan (3) were isolated from the leaves of Cinnamomum australe. The structures of these compounds were assigned by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR data and comparison with data registered in the literature for these compounds. The DNA-damaging activity of 1 is being described for the first time. Keywords: Cinnamomum australe; Lauraceae; DNA-damaging activity. INTRODUÇÃO As espécies de Lauraceae são conhecidas pelo acúmulo de deri- vados fenilpropanoídicos, sendo as lignanas e as neolignanas seus principais marcadores químicos1. Plantas dessa família são encon- tradas nas florestas equatoriais e tropicais; na Mata Atlântica, onde sua ocorrência é marcante, são conhecidas popularmente como ca- nela2. Na região de Cunha, situada no estado de São Paulo, ainda se encontra Mata Atlântica, de altitude, bastante preservada e, dentre as inúmeras famílias de Angiospermae ali representadas, destacam-se várias espécies de Lauraceae sem nenhum estudo químico e/ou bio- lógico. Como parte de um estudo de bioprospecção com plantas de Cerrado e de Mata Atlântica de São Paulo, espécies desta família foram testadas contra linhagens mutantes de Saccharomyces cerevisiae, objetivando a busca de substâncias com ação na repara- ção do DNA deficiente-proficiente3. Dentre as espécies selecionadas, Cinnamomum australe, coletada na Reserva Ecológica de Cunha, apresentou atividade na reparação do DNA de S. cerevisiae, indicativo de uma atividade antitumoral potencial. Fracionamento bio-guiado do extrato etanólico de C. australe levou ao isolamento do derivado bioativo trans-cinamato de trans-3’-metilsulfonilalila (1) juntamen- te com erieliptina (2) e (7R,8S,1’S)-∆8’-3’,5’-dimetoxi-1’,4’-diidro- 4’-oxo-7.0.2’, 8.1’-neolignana (3). O presente artigo descreve o iso- lamento, caracterização dos derivados 1-3 e a atividade no reparo de DNA de 1. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e de 13C foram registrados em um espectrômetro Bruker DRX-300 operando a 300 e a 76 MHz, res- pectivamente, utilizando-se CDCl3 como solvente e TMS como re- ferência interna. As constantes de acoplamento (J) foram expressas em Hz. Para a obtenção dos espectros no ultravioleta foi utilizado um equipamento Beckman DU-65. Os espectros de massas foram obtidos em espectrômetro FISONS-Modelo VG Plattform II, ope- rando a 70 eV, no modo “electrospray” e em espectrômetro HP5988A Hewlett Packard (quadrupolo), por inserção direta e impacto eletrô- nico a 70 eV. Os espectros no IV foram registrados em aparelho FT- IR 1750 Perkin Elmer, na forma de filmes em nujol utilizando jane- las de NaCl. Para as cromatografias em coluna utilizou-se sílica gel 60 (0,063-0,200 mm e 0,230-0,400 mm, Merck) e Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma). Nas cromatografias em placa utilizou-se sílica gel 60 GF254 e PF254 (Merck). As placas foram observadas sob luz UV 254 – 366 nm e reveladas com vapores de iodo ressublimado ou solução de H2SO4 /EtOH (anidro) 1:1, seguida de aquecimento. Material vegetal Folhas de Cinnamomum australe Walt. foram coletadas na Re- serva Ecológica de Cunha, São Paulo, em maio de 2000. O material 197 Derivado Cinamoílico com Atividade no Reparo de DNA Vol. 27, No. 2 foi identificado pela Dra. I. Cordeiro, Curadora do Herbário do Ins- tituto de Botânica de São Paulo, SP; uma exsicata encontra-se aí depositada, sob o no. Cord 1203. Extração e fracionamento As folhas de C. australe (650 g), secas e moídas, foram extraí- das com metanol a frio (3 L). O extrato alcoólico foi evaporado com- pletamente e uma alíquota deste extrato foi submetida ao bioensaio, indicando atividade moderada. O extrato foi dissolvido em metanol- água (80%) e, em seguida, submetido a sucessivas partições com 800 mL de solventes de diferentes polaridades, fornecendo as fra- ções hexânica (3,0 g), diclorometânica (9,8 g) e em acetato de etila (4,5 g). A fração diclorometânica bioativa foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel (5x50 cm, 400 g) utilizando-se misturas de hexano/AcOEt, com aumento de polaridade (1:1, 1:2, 2:3), forne- cendo 14 frações de 300 mL. Todas as frações foram submetidas ao bioensaio com S. cerevisiae e as frações 10-14, bioativas, foram es- colhidas para fracionamento e purificação. Estas frações, após análi- se usual por cromatografia em camada delgada comparativa (CCDC), foram reunidas F-10-14 (102 mg) e, em seguida, o material resultan- te desta reunião foi submetido a uma filtração em gel de Sephadex LH-20, utilizando-se uma mistura de diclorometano-metanol (4:1, 1:1 e 1:4) e metanol. Deste procedimento foram coletadas seis fra- ções (F-1 a F-6), das quais F-5 (38,0 mg) e F-6 (12,0 mg) mantive- ram a atividade. A purificação da fração F-5 foi realizada em coluna cromatográfica de Si gel (1x30 cm), eluída com misturas de CHCl3/ MeOH com aumento gradual de polaridade. Foram recolhidas fra- ções de 3 mL, agrupadas posteriormente em dez frações, de acordo com o perfil cromatográfico monitorado por CCDC. Das duas pri- meiras frações resultantes deste procedimento, foram isoladas as substâncias 1 (3,2 mg) e 2 (16,0 mg). Análise por cromatografia por CCDC, das demais frações impuras, revelou que a F-5-8 era consti- tuída de dois componentes. Esta mistura foi lavada várias vezes com acetona e o sólido remanescente foi purificado por recristalização em CCl4, fornecendo a substância 3 (8 mg). A fração F-6, após lava- gem com éter e recristalização em EtOH, apresentou-se como um sólido cristalino com ponto de fusão 98-99 oC e foi também identificada como 1. trans-cinamato de trans-3’-metilsulfonilalila (1): Cristais, P.

Dados espectroscópicos idênticos aos publicados anteri- ormente para esta substância6. Bioensaio O teste preliminar para avaliação da atividade sobre as vias de reparo e/ou recombinação do DNA foi realizado de acordo com metodologia e protocolos bem estabelecidos3. Este ensaio foi desen- volvido com base na constatação de que a maioria das células tumorais têm falhas em sua capacidade de reparar danos no DNA quando com- paradas com as células normais, sugerindo que agentes com toxidez seletiva para células deficientes no reparo do DNA poderiam ser agen- tes anticancerígenos potenciais. Confirmando este raciocínio foi de- monstrado que leveduras mutantes com esta deficiência são hipersen- síveis à maioria dos agentes que causam dano ao DNA7. Dessa forma, a interpretação dos resultados deste bioensaio está fundamentada na resposta diferencial entre uma levedura com células normais, capazes de fazer reparos no DNA (Rad+), e células que não são capazes de reconstruir a seqüência do DNA (Rad 52Y), frente a uma determinada amostra (extrato bruto, fração e/ou substância pura). A linhagem Rad+ é definida como o tipo selvagem, enquanto Rad 52Y é a linhagem mutante produzida a partir de Rad+, apresentando deficiências relaci- onadas com uma das três maiores vias de reparo do DNA em levedu- ras. Rad 52 Y está associada ao reparo recombinacional do DNA, ou seja, apresenta deficiências na recombinação mitótica (na conversão e “crossing over”) e na recombinação meiótica. O ensaio é conduzido pela medida do halo de inibição do crescimento das células deficien- tes (Rad 52Y), em comparação com as células tipo selvagem Rad+ (proficientes nas vias de reparo do DNA) e com o controle positivo camptotecina. Os resultados são expressos como valores de CI12, con- centração da amostra (µg/mL) requerida para produzir um halo de inibição de 12 mm de diâmetro, ao redor de uma cavidade de 100 µL, após um período de incubação de 48 h, a 30 oC. Os ensaios foram feitos em triplicata e em diferentes concentra- ções para os extratos (4000, 2000, 1000 e 500 µg/mL) e substâncias puras (500, 200, 100 e 50 µg/mL). Os valores de CI12 foram determi- nados das curvas de dose-resposta (log da concentração da amostra em µg/mL vs. valor médio do diâmetro do halo de inibição, em mm). Uma amostra é considerada ativa quando a CI12 obtida para a levedura mutante é três vezes menor que a CI12 obtida para a levedu- ra normal (Rad+) e menor que 2000 µg/mL, para extratos, ou 200 µg/mL, para substâncias puras. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O extrato etanólico das folhas de C. australe apresentou ativida- de seletiva sobre a cepa mutante de S. cerevisiae, Rad 52Y (Tabela 2). A fração diclorometânica proveniente da partição líquido/líquido deste extrato manteve a atividade e, após os procedimentos usuais de fracionamento e purificação, forneceu os constituintes 1-3.

O espectro de massas, obtido pela técnica “electrospray”, do derivado bioativo 1 apresentou um íon molecular [M+Na]+ m/z 289 e os íons fragmentários m/z 210, 154 e 126 atribuídos a [M+Na+ - MeSO2], uma unidade cinamoíloxi [C9H7O+Na+] e ao fragmento re- sultante da perda de CO da unidade cinamoíloxi [C8H8+Na], respec- tivamente. Os dados obtidos de seus espectros de RMN de 1H e de 13C (Tabela 1) indicaram claramente que uma parte da estrutura de 1 é formada por um grupo cinamoílico, confirmando a análise do es- pectro de massas. Análise detalhada dos dados de RMN indicou que a unidade que está ligada à parte cinamoílica corresponde a um sis- tema trans-1,2-dissubstituído, evidenciado pelos sinais em δ 4,95 dd (J = 1,0; 3,0 Hz), δ 7,01 dt (J = 3,0; 16,0 Hz) e 6,65 dt (J = 16,0; 1,0 Hz) e pelo sinal em δ 2,89 (s) referente a um grupo metílico. Estes dados, analisados em conjunto com aqueles obtidos do espec- tro de massas, análise elementar e comparação com a literatura4,8 permitiram concluir que 1 é a substância conhecida trans-cinamato de trans-3’-metilsulfonilalila. Em adição, as análises dos dados espectrais de RMN de 13C e de HMBC permitiram atribuir de manei- ra inequívoca os valores dos deslocamentos químicos dos carbonos 4 e 3’ dessa substância (Tabela 1) uma vez que, no único registro encontrado na literatura4, esses valores foram obtidos por técnicas unidimensionais que não permitiram sua discriminação. Este é o ter- ceiro registro do isolamento dessa substância e destaca-se que os registros anteriores foram também de espécies de Lauraceae (Cinnamomum triplinervis8 e Phoebe brenesii4). Os dados de RMN de 1H e de 13C para irieliptina5 (2) indicaram tratar-se de um derivado do ácido tetrônico, já conhecido como um dos constituintes químicos isolados de Iryanthera elliptica Ducke5. A estrutura da substância 3 foi elucidada a partir de seus dados espectrais de RMN de 1H e de 13C que demonstraram tratar-se da neolignana (7R,8S,1’S)-∆8’-3’,5’-dimetoxi-1’,4’-diidro-4’-oxo- Tabela 2.

O derivado cinamoílico 1 mostrou atividade moderada (CI12 100 µg/mL), em comparação com o agente anticancerígeno camptotecina (CI12 5 µg/mL), porém seletiva contra a linhagem Rad 52Y (Tabela 2) enquanto que 2 e 3 mostraram-se inativos na dosa- gem testada (500 µg/mL). Este dado é de grande interesse porque indica que a substância 1 (CI12 100 µg/mL) tem especificidade sobre as células deficientes nos mecanismos de reparo do DNA (Rad 52Y), inibindo o seu crescimento, mas atua muito pouco sobre o cresci- mento das células normais (CI12 >500 µg/mL), proficientes no repa- ro do (DNA Rad+). Essa característica é fundamental quando o inte- resse é a busca de agentes anticancerígenos, pois o que se deseja é a seleção de candidatos que sejam tóxicos para as células tumorais ou deficientes (Rad 52Y), impedindo a sua proliferação, mas que sejam inativos, ou atuem muito pouco, sobre o crescimento das células sadias (Rad+). Esse é o primeiro registro na literatura dessa classe de substân- cia, com atividade em S. cerevisiae geneticamente modificada (defi- ciência relacionada com uma das maiores vias de reparação do DNA)3. Substâncias com essa ação citotóxica seletiva nas células deficientes no reparo do DNA podem agir como um agente antitumoral poten- cial.

INTRODUÇÃO Vários produtos naturais com propriedades terapêuticas foram isolados de espécies de fungos, especialmente agentes quimio- terápicos, como penicilinas e cefalosporinas usadas até hoje como antibióticos; mevinolina, um agente redutor de colesterol; bleomi- cinas, daunorubicinas e análogos, como agentes antitumorais; avermectina B, um anti-helmíntico de largo espectro, entre outros1,2. Recentemente, o aumento de infecções fúngicas causadas por fun- gos oportunistas, como Candida e Aspergillus, e a resistência microbiana a uma série de antibióticos disponível no mercado es- tão motivando, novamente, as companhias farmacêuticas a investi- rem na busca por substâncias antifúngicas de fontes naturais2. Dentre os microrganismos que acumulam substâncias antifúngicas, fungos e leveduras destacam-se pela quantidade de produtos farmacêuticos de uso corrente na medicina com tais pro- priedades. Os fungos filamentosos, onde os endofíticos estão incluídos, constituem um grupo de microrganismos que biossintetizam uma quantidade fantástica de metabólitos secundários, chegando, em casos especiais, a uma produção 73% superior a de outras classes de microrganismos3. Fungos endofíticos são microrganismos que habitam o interior de plantas e constituem-se em uma fonte valiosa de produtos bioativos4. Este nicho de fungos associados a espécies vegetais de Cerrado e da Mata Atlântica permanece praticamente sem qualquer estudo químico e biológico sendo, portanto, uma fonte potencial de substâncias de interesse farmacológico. Dando continuidade às nossas pesquisas de bioprospecção, vári- as espécies vegetais de Cerrado e Mata Atlântica foram selecionadas para isolamento e cultivo de fungos endofíticos. De Palicourea marcgravii St. Hil., uma Rubiaceae de larga ocorrência no Cerrado, e conhecida popularmente como “erva de rato” ou “café bravo”, fo- ram isolados vários fungos endofíticos. Dentre os já identificados, Xylaria sp. foi selecionado para estudo devido a atividade apresenta- da por seu extrato bruto frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium cladosporioides e Cladosporium sphaerospermum, indicando a produção de metabólitos com atividade antifúngica em potencial. Xylaria sp. foi submetido aos procedimentos usuais de cultivo em larga escala para fornecimento dos extratos brutos que após fracionamento bioguiado, levou ao isolamento de 5 substânci- as: ácido 2-hexilideno-3-metilbutanodióico (1), citocalasina D (2), 7-declorogriseofulvina (3), citocalasina B (4) e griseofulvina (5) (Figura 1). PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectrômetro Varian INOVA-500 operando a 500 MHz para o núcleo de 1H e em 125 MHz para o núcleo de 13C; TMS foi utilizado como referência interna. Os espectros de mas- sas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa reso- lução FISONS- Modelo VG Platfform II, no modo Electrospray. As análises cromatográficas por CLAE no modo analítico foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar da Varian acoplado ao detetor ProStar 330 de arranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analítica Phenomenex Fenil-Hexil (250 x 4,60 mm; 5 μm). No modo preparativo, as análises por CLAE foram realizadas em equipa- mento ProStar da Varian acoplado ao detetor ProStar UV, utilizan- do coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexil (250 x 21,20 mm; 10 μm). Nas separações cromatográficas em coluna aberta ou sob pressão fo- ram utilizadas sílica gel C-18 (Merck) e Sephadex LH-20 (Merck) como fases estacionárias. Para cultivo de Xylaria sp. em meio lí- quido foram utilizados 20 frascos de Erlenmeyers (500 mL) con- tendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo preparado a partir de água Mili- Q e PDB (DIFCO), posteriormente submetidos a esterilização em autoclave a 121 oC e 1 atm de pressão por 20 min. Para cultivo em meio sólido de milho foram colocados 90 g de milho descascado (Yoki) em 2 Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 75 mL de água desti- lada. Estes meios foram autoclavados quatro vezes (4 dias) por 40 min à temperatura de 121 oC e 1 atm de pressão. 992 Quim. Nova Cafêu et al. Material vegetal A espécie vegetal Palicourea marcgravii St. Hil. (Rubiaceae) foi coletada, em junho de 2001, na Estação Ecológica Experimen- tal de Mogi-Guaçú (SP). Uma exsicata do material vegetal identi- ficado encontra-se depositada no Herbário do Instituto de Botânica da Secretaria do Meio Ambiente de São Paulo (SP). Isolamento da cepa fúngica O fungo endofítico foi isolado de folhas saudáveis de Palicourea marcgravii. As folhas foram lavadas com água e sabão e esteriliza- das por imersão em NaClO 1% (5 min) e em etanol 70% (1 min), seguidas de lavagem com água estéril (10 min) e secagem5. Após o processo de esterilização, as folhas foram cortadas e incubadas em placas de Petri contendo PDA, às quais foi adicionado o antibióti- co sulfato de antamicina (50 mg/mL) para evitar crescimento de bactérias contaminantes. Repiques sucessivos em placas de Petri contendo PDA resultaram no isolamento de 4 linhagens codifica- das como PM-01, PM-02, PM-03 e PM-04. Estas linhagens foram preservadas em frascos esterilizados com água. A linhagem PM- 03, identificada como Xylaria sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning, Departamento de Fitopatologia da Universidade Federal de Lavras – MG, foi selecionada para estudo químico, visando a obtenção das substâncias bioativas. Cultivo do microrganismo e obtenção dos extratos brutos A cepa fúngica de Xylaria sp. foi repicada em placa de Petri contendo PDA e incubada por 7 dias. Após este período, o fungo foi inoculado nos meios de cultivo líquido (PDB) e sólido (Milho). Em PDB, Xylaria sp. foi cultivada em 4000 mL de meio (20 fras- cos de Erlenmeyers de 500 mL) e mantida em incubadora rotatória (“shaker”) sob temperatura controlada (24 oC) por aproximadamente 28 dias, fornecendo o caldo fermentado. O caldo foi submetido à filtração para separação dos micélios e à partição líquido/líquido com AcOEt que, após a evaporação do solvente, forneceu 2,0 g do extrato bruto acetato de etila (PDB-AcOEt). Xylaria sp. também foi cultivada em meio sólido milho, onde permaneceu incubada por 21 dias, à 24 oC em modo estático. Em seguida, foi realizada a extração com metanol, filtração para separação dos micélios e con- centração do solvente, fornecendo 5,3 g de extrato bruto metanólico (milho-MeOH). Isolamento dos constituintes químicos O extrato bruto PDB-AcOEt (2,0 g) foi dissolvido em acetato de etila e, em seguida, particionado com hexano e acetonitrila, resul- tando em duas soluções. A solução ACN, após concentração, forne- ceu a fração ACN (0,7 g) que foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna usando sílica de fase reversa (C-18), eluída com MeOH:H2O no modo gradiente, resultando em sete sub-frações. As sub-frações ACN-4 a ACN-7 foram reunidas (ACN4-7; 400 mg) devido à bioatividade apresentada frente às linhagens Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. Esta sub-fração ACN4-7 foi submetida a uma partição com acetato de etila e solução de hidróxido de sódio 5%. A fase aquosa foi tratada com ácido clorídrico até pH 5 e, em seguida, extraída com clorofórmio que, após a concentração do solvente, forneceu a substância 1 (100 mg). A fase orgânica (AcOEt), após concentração do solvente, foi fracionada em uma co- luna Sephadex LH-20 eluída com metanol, resultando em 10 sub- frações (FCS 1-10). A sub-fração FCS-1 (23 mg) foi submetida à CLAE preparativa empregando modo de eluição isocrático acetonitrila:água (38:62), fluxo 20 mL/min, λ 221 nm e coluna fenil hexil, resultando no isolamento da substância 2 (3,5 mg). O extrato bruto milho-MeOH (5,3 g) foi analisado por RMN de 1H, onde constataram-se vários sinais referentes a hidrogênios metínicos e metílicos típicos de açúcares. Para remover estes açú- cares, uma porção do extrato (1 g) foi dissolvida (parcialmente) em acetato de etila, obtendo-se a fração AcOEt-milho (210 mg). Em seguida, esta fração foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna com sílica de fase reversa C-18 no modo de eluição isocrático empregando MeOH:H2O (80:20), resultando em M-1 (100 mg). A subfração M-1 foi purificada por CLAE preparativa utilizando como eluente MeOH:H2O (60:40), fluxo de 15 mL/min, coluna fenil hexil e λ 221 nm fornecendo 8 sub-frações (M1.1 – M1.8). As sub-fra- ções M1.3, M1.5 e M1.7 resultaram no isolamento das substâncias 3 (8,3 mg), 4 (20,6 mg) e 5 (8,8 mg). Figura 1. Substâncias produzidas por Xylaria sp. 993 Substâncias Antifúngicas de Xylaria sp. Vol. 28, No. 6 Bioensaio Os extratos brutos (PDB-AcOEt e milho-MeOH) e as substân- cias isoladas foram submetidos à técnica de Bioautografia para detecção de atividade antifúngica. Este bioensaio consiste na nebulização de suspensões dos fungos Cladosporium cladosporioides e Cladosporium sphaerospermum (concentração 5 x 107 esporos/mL em solução de glicose e sais) em placas de CCDC contendo 400 μg dos extratos brutos e 100 μg das substân- cias puras, previamente eluídas com solvente adequado. Em segui- da, as placas foram incubadas em câmara úmida a 25 oC por 48 h. O aparecimento de zonas de inibição na placa nebulizada com C. sphaerospermum e/ou C. cladosporioides indica a presença de substância(s) com potencial antifúngico6. A nistatina foi a substân- cia utilizada como antifúngico padrão. As substâncias puras que se mostraram potencialmente bioativas foram submetidas a bioensaio, para determinação do limite de detecção. Os resultados são expressos como valores de concentra- ção da amostra (μg/mL) requeridos para produzir um halo de inibi- ção comparável com o produzido pelo padrão nistatina. Os ensaios foram realizados em diferentes concentrações (100, 50, 25, 10, 5 e 1 μg/mL) para as substâncias puras e para o padrão. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos brutos PDB-AcOEt e milho- MeOH, produzidos pelo fungo endofítico Xylaria sp., resultou no isolamento do ácido 2-hexilideno-3-metilbutanodióico (1), citocalasina D (2), 7-declorogriseofulvina (3), citocalasina B (4) e griseofulvina (5). A identificação destas substâncias foi realizada com base na comparação de seus dados espectroscópicos (RMN 1H e 13C, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC e EM) com valores disponí- veis na literatura. Os metabólitos 1-5 já haviam sido produzidos por fungos da família Xylariaceae, entretanto, este é o primeiro relato da produção de 3, 4 e 5 por um fungo endofítico. A análise detalhada dos espectros de massas, RMN de 1H e 13C (uni e bidimensionais), além da comparação com dados da litera- tura7, permitiu a identificação de 1 como ácido 2-hexilideno-3- metilbutanodióico. A substância 2 foi identificada como citocalasina D (C30H37NO6) através da análise dos dados de RMN de 1H e 13C e EM-ES (+120 V) e evidenciou 13 graus de insaturação. A análise dos dados de RMN de 1H e 13C indicou a presença de três carbonilas, um anel benzênico monossubstituído e seis carbonos olefínicos, o que re- sultou no grau de insaturação 10. Os 3 graus de insaturações rema- nescentes sugeriram que a molécula fosse constituída por 3 anéis, além do anel aromático. O espectro de hidrogênio apresentou si- nais em δH 3,57 e 5,26 característicos de hidrogênios carbinólicos, que foram atribuídos à H-7 e H-21. A geometria das ligações du- plas Δ13-14 e Δ19-20 foi determinada como E, devido às constantes de acoplamento (J = 15,0 Hz) entre os hidrogênios. Os sinais δH 1,38, 1,05, 0,39 e 2,27 foram atribuídos às metilas H3C-23, H3C-22, H3C- 11 e H3C-25, respectivamente. O sinal referente a uma metila em δH 2,27 é típico de citocalasina com um grupo acetato na forma de radical. Estas informações aliadas à análise dos dados espectrométricos de RMN de 1H, 13C, gHMQC, gHMBC, gCOSY, EM e comparação com os dados da literatura8 confirmaram a subs- tância 2 como sendo uma citocalasina do tipo D. A configuração relativa de 2 foi determinada por comparação dos valores de deslo- camentos químicos de RMN 1H e 13C, constantes de acoplamentos e comparação com os dados da literatura. Experimento de rotação ótica forneceu [α]D 25 +15,4 (c. 0,25 EtOH), condizente com a lite- ratura9, permitindo identificá-la como (+)-citocalasina D. Os valo- res dos deslocamentos químicos da citocalasina D (2) estão apre- sentados na Tabela 1. A substância 4 foi identificada como citocalasina B através da análise dos dados espectrométricos de RMN de 1H e 13C (uni e bidimensionais), EM-ES (+120 V) e comparação com dados da literatura10,11. Os sinais registrados pelo espectro de RMN de 1H em δH 5,81, 5,03, 6,76 e 5,70 foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios das ligações duplas Δ13-14 e Δ21-22, respectivamente. Ambas ligações du- plas possuem geometria E, uma vez que a constante de acoplamento entre os hidrogênios H-13-H-14 e H-21-H-22 é de 15,5 Hz. Pelo espectro de RMN de 1H também foi possível verificar a presença de 2 metilas (CH3-11 e CH3-24) e de hidrogênios carbinólicos (δH 3,61 e 4,36) atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-7 e H-20. Os dados espectrométricos de 4 foram comparados com os da citocalasina D (2), onde foi possível notar uma grande semelhança nos sinais e constatou-se que 4 se tratava de uma substância da classe de citocalasinas. A diferença marcante entre 2 e 4 está na ausência de um sinal entre δH 2,10-2,30, atribuído ao deslocamento químico da metila do acetato, o que permitiu propor que a ligação com o C-9 ocorre com o oxigênio do grupo acetato, em vez de se ligar no átomo de carbono como no caso da citocalasina D (2). A configu- ração relativa de 4 foi determinada por comparação dos valores de Tabela 1.

Nova Cafêu et al. Os extratos brutos (PDB e milho) e as substâncias isoladas fo- ram submetidas a um ensaio preliminar para avaliação da ativida- de antifúngica através da técnica de Bioautografia. O extrato bruto obtido em milho, assim como as substâncias isoladas deste extrato (3, 4 e 5) não se mostraram ativas frente às linhagens Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. Entretanto a griseofulvina (5) é atualmente utilizada como um poderoso antimicótico, sendo comercializada em medicamentos como Fulcinâ (Zeneca) e Sporostatinâ (Shering Plough) com atividade contra várias espéci- es de Microsporum, Epidermophyton e Trychophyton. O extrato bruto obtido após cultivo de Xylaria sp. em PDB e os compostos ácido 2-hexilideno-3-metilbutanodióico (1) e citocalasina D (2) mostraram-se ativos frente às linhagens C. cladosporioides e C. spahaerospermum. Os resultados dos limites de detecção das subs- tâncias 1 e 2 estão apresentados na Tabela 3, e este é o primeiro relato do potencial antifúngico demonstrado por estas substâncias. CONCLUSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos produzidos por Xylaria sp. per- mitiu o isolamento de substâncias com atividade antifúngica em potencial e de interesse comercial, evidenciando os fungos endofíticos como promissores na busca por metabólitos bioativos. Este é o primeiro relato das substâncias 3, 4 e 5 serem produzidas por um fungo endofítico do gênero Xylaria. As substâncias 1 e 2 já foram relatadas como metabólitos de Xylaria sp., porém esta é deslocamentos químicos em RMN de 1H, 13C, constantes de acoplamentos e comparação com dados da literatura8. O experi- mento de rotação ótica forneceu [α]D 25 +71,3 (c. 0,006 MeOH) e permitiu identificar 4 como (+)-citocalasina B. Os valores dos des- locamentos químicos da citocalasina B (4) estão apresentados na Tabela 1. A substância 3 foi identificada como 7-decloro-griseofulvina (C17H18O6) através da análise dos dados espectrométricos e com- paração com a literatura12. O espectro de massas obtido pela téc- nica EM-ES (+35 V) apresentou o pico base (100%) em m/z 319 [M + H]+ e picos em m/z 341 [M + Na]+ e m/z 181 [M + C8H10O2]+, indicando 9 graus de insaturação, permitindo propor um sistema de três ciclos e seis insaturações. O espectro de RMN de 1H re- gistrou sinais em δH 6,15 (d, J=1,5 Hz) e δH 5,97 (d, J=1,5 Hz) sugerindo um padrão de substituição meta, em um anel aromáti- co tetrassubstituído. Observaram-se singletos em δH 5,47, 3,83, 3,82 e 3,55, indicando a presença de um hidrogênio olefínico e três metoxilas, sendo duas aromáticas e uma sobre sistema insaturado, respectivamente. Foi verificado um dubleto em δH 0,89 (6,5 Hz) e um multipleto em δH 2,68, indicativo da presença de uma metila e um hidrogênio metínico. O espectro de RMN de 1H também registrou dois duplos dubletos em δH 2,33 (dd, J= 17,0 e 5,0 Hz) e δH 2,99 (dd, J=17,0 e 13,0 Hz) com δC 40,1, evidencian- do tratar-se de um metileno α a um centro estereogênico e a uma carbonila α,β insaturada. O espectro de RMN de 13C indicou a presença de 17 átomos de carbono, dos quais seis foram atribuí- dos como sendo do tipo aromático (δC 176,1; 170,4; 159,1; 104,4; 93,3 e 88,6), dois carbonos sp2 em δC 171,3 e 104,8, dois carbo- nos carbonílicos em δC 197,3 e 192,4, três metoxilas atribuídas aos sinais em δC 56,6, 56,1 e 56,1, uma metila em δC 14,2, um metino em δC 36,6, um carbono metilênico em δC 40,1 e um car- bono quaternário em δC 89,9. Através da análise detalhada do mapa de contorno gHMQC foi possível atribuir os hidrogênios aos respectivos átomos de carbono. Pela análise do mapa de con- torno gHMBC observaram-se as correlações entre H-5↔C-3a/C- 7a/C-7/C-6, H-7↔C-3a/C-4/C-5/C-6, 4-OCH3↔C-4* ou C-6*, 6-OCH3↔ C-4* ou C-6* (*podem estar trocados), H-3’↔C-1’/ C-2’/C-4’, 2’OCH3↔C-2’, 6’-CH3↔C-6’/C-5’/C-1’, Ha5’↔C-4’/ C-6’/C-1’, Hb-5’↔C-4’/C-6’/CH3-6’ e H-6’↔C-1’, os quais con- firmaram 3 como 7-decloro-griseofulvina. A configuração relati- va de 3 foi determinada por comparação dos valores dos desloca- mentos em RMN de 1H, 13C, constantes de acoplamentos e com- paração com dados da literatura12. Após experimento de rotação ótica, que forneceu [α]D 25 = + 146,1 (c. 0,0035 em CHCl3), foi possível identificar esta substância como (+)-7-decloro- griseofulvina. Os valores dos deslocamentos químicos da 7- decloro-griseofulvina (3) estão apresentados na Tabela 2. Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 5 foram comparados com os espectros obtidos para 3 e foi possível notar a grande semelhan- ça no perfil espectral destas duas substâncias, sendo a diferença marcante a ausência de um dubleto na região de aromático e a presença de apenas um sinal, na forma de singleto, nesta região (δH 6,07). Este fato sugeriu a presença de um anel aromático pentassubstituído em C-7. O espectro de massas de 5 obtido pela técnica EM-ES a +35 V forneceu os picos m/z 375, indicando o aduto com sódio ([M + Na]+), m/z 353 [M + H]+ e m/z 377 [M+2]+ evidenciando a presença de um átomo de cloro, sugerindo estar posicionado em C-7. Estas informações aliadas à comparação com a literatura12 conduziram à estrutura da griseofulvina (C17H17ClO6). A rotação ótica de 5 foi medida e o [α]D = +104 (c. 0,0035 em acetona) permitiu identificar a substância como (+)-griseofulvina. Os valores dos deslocamentos químicos da griseofulvina (5) estão apresentados na Tabela 2. Tabela 3.

A produção das substâncias 1 e 2 com atividade frente aos fun- gos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum por Xylaria sp. dá indícios de que os endófitos associados com Palicourea marcgravii se encontram em uma relação de simbiose, produzindo substâncias antifúngicas contra possíveis fungos fitopatogênicos. Os resultados encontrados até o momento evidenciam a potencialidade destes microrganismos e reforçam a necessidade do estudo químico biomonitorado neste nicho de fungos.

RADLK (SAPOTACEAE) Viviane Cândida da Silva, Márcia Nasser Lopes* e Vanderlan da Silva Bolzani Departamento de Química Orgânica, Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista “Júlio de Mesquita Filho”, CP 355, 14801-970 Araraquara - SP, Brasil Recebido em 5/4/05; aceito em 12/8/05; publicado na web em 8/2/06 The fractionation of the antioxidant ethyl acetate extract obtained from the dried leaves of Chrysophyllum marginatum afforded six substances identified as: α-amirin, gallic acid, myricitrin, quercitrin, (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate. This study contributes to the knowledge of the secondary metabolites produced by one more species of the Brazilian Flora, until now not investigated. Moreover, this study allowed the identification of three substances with antioxidant activity previously detected in this species. Keywords: Sapotaceae; Chrysophyllum marginatum; antioxidant. INTRODUCTION Chemical and biological studies of Sapotaceae species from Brazil are scarce. The family comprises 1100 species included in 53 genera1. Sapotaceae species provide economically important products such as latex for gutta percha and chewing gum, hard and durable wood, and many edible fruits2. Chemically, the family is characterized by the presence of triterpenoids and steroids, which are used as chemotaxonomic markers3 in Argania4, Madhuca5, Mimusops 6, and Sideroxylon7. Chrysophyllum marginatum, commonly known as aguai-verme- lho or guatambu-de-leite, is distributed in states of Bahia, Goias until Rio Grande do Sul. The plant can reach 10 meters of height, and possesses simple and alternating leaves, small and perfumed flowers, fruits with succulent pulp, black when ripe, which are consumed by the birds in general. Wood is used at carpentry and as coal8. The lack of chemical information about Chrysophyllum together with the presence of antioxidant polyphenolics in the fruits of Chrysophyllum cainito9 prompted us to take up phytochemical investigation on the C. marginatum. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The ethanol extract of the dried and powdered leaves of C. marginatum was partitioned into hexane, ethyl acetate and n- butanol. The ethyl acetate layer showed antioxidant activity using β-carotene/TLC assay. This extract was fractioned on Sephadex LH-20, eluted with MeOH. After analysis by TLC, collected fractions were combined, resulting in 30 subfractions. Without subsequent stages of purification, three subfractions were identified as gallic acid 2, myricitrin 4 and (-)-epigallocatechin- 3-O-gallate 6. Subfraction 4 was submitted to column chromatography on silica flash, and after TLC, some fractions were combined and one of them was identified as α-amirin 1. Subfraction 11 and 14 were submitted to preparative TLC, yielding compounds quercitrin 3 and (-)-epigallocatechin 5, respectively. All compounds isolated (Figure 1) are known and were identified by spectroscopic means and by comparison with literature data10-13, mainly 13C NMR δ values. The 13C NMR of 1 showed signals at δ 126.1, 139.7, 39.8 (2x) and 17.6 corresponding, respectively, to C-12, C-13, C-19, C-20 and C-29, that corroborate the ursane structure to the compound. The 1H NMR of 3 and 4 showed signals that suggested the structure of quercetin and miricetin, respectively, for the aglycones of the compounds. In both spectra signals corresponding to a rhamnose sugar portion were also found, with methyl hydrogens at δ 0.81 (d, J = 6 Hz, 3) and δ 0.92 (d, J = 6 Hz, 4). The 13C NMR spectra confirmed the structures of aglycones. The localization of the sugars in the flavonols at C-3 was indicated by g-HMBC experiment, which showed correlation between the anomeric hydrogen at δ 5.47 and olefinic carbon at δ 132 for 3, and δ 5.24 and δ 135.9 for 4. The 1H NMR of 5 and 6 showed signals that suggested the structure of flavonol miricetin to aromatic systems. Hydrogens at δ 2.40 – 3.10, δ 4.00 (5) and δ 5.54 (6) indicated an oxygenated aliphatic portion in the compounds. The 13C NMR spectra confirmed compounds as flavan-3-ols, due to signals at δ 28 and 25.9 (C-4), δ 64.9 and 68.7 (C-3) and δ 78.1 and 77.4 (C-2) to 5 and 6, respectively, besides signals at δ 165.3, 121.2, 109.3, 138.1 and 145.2 belonging gallate for 6. The localization of the gallate in the flavan-3-ol was indicated by chemical shifts of C-2, C-3 and C-4. According to Agrawal10, esterification by gallic acid causes an expected 2 – 3 ppm downfield shift of the C-3 signal, and upfield shifts of 0.5 – 1.5 ppm of C-2 and 2 – 3 ppm of C-4 resonances. All isolated compounds (5 mg mL-1) were submitted to antioxidant test with a solution of β-carotene in CH2Cl2 on TLC plates. After four hours, compounds 3, 4 and 6 exhibited orange spots strongly suggesting that they are responsible for antioxidant activity previously detected in the ethyl acetate extract. EXPERIMENTAL PART General procedures NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian As 500 (500 MHz for 1H, 125 MHz for 13C) spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ in ppm) are given from internal standard CHCl3 (7.26) for 1H NMR, 13CDCl3 (77.0) for 13C NMR. Column chromatography was performed on Silica flash (35-70 mesh) and Sephadex LH-20. TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates. Spots were visualized by absorption of UV radiation and anisaldehyde 494 Quim. Nova da Silva et al. 2% in H2SO4 after heating. Antioxidant zones were detected using a solution of β-carotene in CH2Cl2 on TLC plates. The solvents were evaporated in Büchi Rotary Evaporator. Plant material Chrysophyllum marginatum (Hook. & Arn.) Radlk (Sapotaceae) was collected in Fortaleza-Ripasa Farm, in Ibaté - SP, Brazil in March 2003. A voucher specimen (Cavalheiro 1001) is deposited at the Instituto de Botânica of São Paulo, Brazil. Antioxidant assay Bleaching of β-carotene on TLC Plates Samples were eluted on TLC plates which were then dried and sprayed with 0.02% solution of β-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background. The remaining yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidants substances14. Extraction and isolation Dried and powdered leaves (212.0 g) of C. marginatum were successively extracted with ethanol at room temperature. The EtOH extract was evaporated in vacuo to give a crude extract (52.5 g). The extract (25.0 g) was solubilized in MeOH-H2O (8:2) and partitioned into hexane (5.3 g), ethyl acetate (3.1 g) and n-butanol (11.7 g). The resulting extracts were tested as for antifungal, antitumoral and antioxidant (β-carotene) activities, giving positive for the antioxidant test in the extract AcOEt. The crude AcOEt extract (3.1 g) was fractioned on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, and after analysis by TLC (AcOEt-MeOH 85:15), resulting in 30 subfractions. Subfraction 8 gave gallic acid (2, 70.0 mg), subfraction 12 gave myricitrin (4, 208.0 mg) and subfraction 21 gave (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (6, 47.0 mg). Subfraction 4 (190.0 mg) was submitted to column chromatography on Silica flash eluted with Hex- AcOEt with increasing polarity to give 12 fractions which one was identified as α-amirin (1, 4.0 mg). Subfraction 11 (37.0 mg) was applied to preparative TLC (5 x AcOEt + 1% HAc) yielding quercitrin (3; 5.3 mg) and 4 (9.8 mg). Subfraction 14, after preparative TLC (3 x AcOEt + 1% HAc) afforded (-)-epigallocatechin (5, 25.3 mg). All the isolated substances were tested with solution of β-carotene in CH2Cl2 on TLC plates (silica gel, AcOEt-MeOH 8:2). ααααα-amirin (1) was isolated in 0.129% yield from the AcOEt extract of the leaves of C. marginatum by a combination of Sephadex LH- 20 and Silica flash chromatography. The 1H and 13C NMR data, in (CD3)2CO, were in accordance with those reported in ref. 11. gallic acid (2) was isolated in 2.258% yield from the AcOEt extract of the leaves of C. marginatum by Sephadex LH-20. The 1H and 13C NMR data, in DMSO-d6, were in accordance with those reported in ref. 10 and 12. quercitrin (3) was isolated in 0.171% yield from the AcOEt extract of the leaves of C. marginatum by a combination of Sephadex LH- 20 and preparative TLC. The 1H and 13C NMR, in DMSO-d6, were in accordance with those reported in ref. 10. myricitrin (4) was isolated in 6.710% yield from the AcOEt extract of the leaves of C. marginatum by Sephadex LH-20. The 1H and 13C NMR data, in (CD3)2CO, were in accordance with those reported in ref. 10. (-)-epigallocatechin (5) was isolated in 0.816% yield from the AcOEt extract of the leaves of C. marginatum by a combination of Sephadex LH-20 and preparative TLC. The 1H and 13C NMR, in DMSO-d6, were in accordance with those reported in ref. 10, 12 and 13. (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (6) was isolated in 1.516% yield from the AcOEt extract of the leaves of C. marginatum by Sephadex LH-20. The 1H and 13C NMR data, in (CD3)2CO, were in accordance with those reported in ref. 10. Figure 1. Substances isolated of leaves from Chrysophyllum marginatum 495 Chemical Study of Leaves of Chrysophyllum marginatum Vol. 29, No. 3 CONCLUSIONS The chemical study of the leaves of Chrysophyllum marginatum led to the isolation and identification of six substances.

The phytochemical investigation of trypanocidal extracts from leaves and stems of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani (Rutaceae) afforded new pyranoflavones along with the known compounds flavone, 7-methoxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, haplotusine, 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone alkaloid, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosteryl benzoate. Their structures were established based on their spectral data. NMR data for the alkaloid haplotusine and the new pyranoflavones are described for the first time herein. These compounds were assayed on the tripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Among them, haplotusine and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone showed moderate values of IC50 136.9 and 144.9 µM, respectively. Keywords: Conchocarpus heterophyllus; trypanocidal activity; pyranoflavones. INTRODUÇÃO A doença de Chagas, causada pelo protozoário Trypanosoma cruzi, é uma das mais graves endemias do Brasil. No Continente Americano, ela afeta 16-18 milhões de indivíduos, sendo que 100 milhões estão sob risco de contaminação.1 Devido à ampla distribuição geográfica desta doença, à falta de tratamento eficaz e seguro, e às graves manifestações clínicas que ocasiona, a procura de novas substâncias para a profilaxia e/ou tratamento desta endemia se faz necessária. Neste contexto, as plantas são valiosas fontes de novos com- postos ativos e com baixa toxicidade.2 De fato, segundo um levan- tamento recente, 61% dos 877 novos fármacos desenvolvidos du- rante o período de 1981-2002 são produtos naturais, ou substân- cias desenvolvidas a partir deles.3 De plantas da família Rutaceae foram isolados alcalóides e lignanas com atividades tripanocidas.4,5 Além disso, as atividades sobre o T. cruzi ou sobre sua enzima GAPDH (gliceraldeído 3- fosfatodesidrogenase) de vários extratos e algumas substâncias iso- ladas desta mesma família foram determinadas.6-8 A espécie Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) pertence à família Rutaceae (ordem Rutales) e era anteriormente denominada de Angostura heterophylla (A. St.-Hil.) Alb.9 Nenhum estudo fitoquímico sobre o gênero é descrito na literatura. Entretanto, do gênero Angostura foram isolados alcalóides acridônicos.10 Os extratos e as frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus apresentaram atividade sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 Neste trabalho são descritos o isolamento, as atividades tripanocidas das substâncias obtidas de tais extratos/frações, assim como os dados de RMN do alcalóide haplotusina (1) e das piranoflavonas inéditas (2). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus, ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi, permitiu o isolamento de esteróides, flavonas e alcalóides 2- e 4- quinolônicos. A partir do extrato hexânico do caule de C. heterophyllus foram isolados os esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol;11 da fração diclorometânica proveniente do extrato hexânico das folhas, o benzoato de β-sitosterila12 e uma mistura de piranoflavonas inéditas (2); da fração acetato de etila deste mesmo extrato, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona13 e 5-hidroxiflavona;14 e da fra- ção acetato de etila do extrato metanólico do caule, flavona, 7- metoxiflavona, haplotusina (1)15 e o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4- quinolona (3).16 Todas as substâncias foram identificadas através da análise dos seus dados espectroscópicos e comparação com os da literatura. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) está sendo descrita pela primeira vez Figura 1.

Entretanto, os dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) não estavam descritos.15 No espectro de RMN 1H do alcalóide 1 foram observados quatro sinais relativos a hidrogênios aromáticos [8,00 (dl, J = 8,0 Hz), 7,73 (m), 7,68 (m) e 7,34 δ (ddd, J = 8,0, 6,4 e 1,6 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a presença de um anel aromático orto- dissubstituído na substância 1. Adicionalmente, um singleto em 6,08 δ, integrado para um hidrogênio, revelou a identidade dessa substân- cia como um alcalóide 4-R-2-quinolônico, que é de ocorrência bas- tante ampla em plantas da família Rutaceae.17 Entretanto, apesar do alcalóide 1 ser do tipo 4-R-2-quinolônico, apresenta a ligação N- OCH3, que é bastante incomum. A presença desse grupo foi deduzida a partir do sinal em 63,73 δ no espectro de RMN 13C. As atribuições dos dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) (Tabela 1) foram realizadas através da análise dos mapas de contorno de HSQC e HMBC. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) foi identificada através de EM e RMN, em uma e duas dimensões. Seu espectro de RMN 1H apre- sentou sinais relativos a oito hidrogênios aromáticos [8,23 (dd, J = 7,9 e 1,6 Hz), 7,84 (dd, J = 7,8 e 1,6 Hz), 7,69 (ddd, J = 8,4, 7,2 e 1,6 Hz), 7,55 (dl, J = 8,4 Hz), 7,42 (m), 7,40 (m), 7,07 (ddd, J = 7,8, 7,8 e 0,9 Hz) e 6,98 δ (dl, J = 8,2 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a existência de dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Este fato foi confirmado pela análise do espectro de COSY 1H-1H. O espectro de RMN 1H apresentou ainda um sinal em 5,69 δ (1H, dd, J = 9,5 e 3,4 Hz) e vários sinais na região mais blindada [1,85 e 1,70 (m), 1,25 e 0,88 δ (t)]. Observou-se também que os hidrogênios em 1,85 e 1,70 δ acoplavam entre si e com o hidrogê- nio em 5,69 δ (dd). O mapa de contorno de HSQC permitiu a deter- minação dos deslocamentos químicos dos carbonos (Tabela 2) li- gados aos hidrogênios descritos anteriormente. Os experimentos de RMN 13C indicaram, excetuando-se a região mais blindada, a existência de 8 CH aromáticos e 7 carbonos quaternários, o que sugeriu a natureza de 2 como um flavonóide, mais especificamente como uma flavona. Além disso, definiu-se que tal flavona deveria ser substituída em 3, já que não existia o sinal de H-3 (geralmente em 6,8 δ) e em 2', pois só existiam dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Por conseqüência, foi determinado que entre os anéis B e C da flavona havia ocorrido ciclização, com formação de um anel pirano. Este tipo de ciclização é observada em flavonóides prenilados.18 Entretanto, nunca foi descrita na literatura a ocorrência de ciclização de uma flavona para uma piranoflavona através de uma cadeia policetídica, como é o caso de 2. A presença do anel pirano foi confirmada através das correlações (2J e 3J) de H-11 (5,69 δ) com C-2 (155,95 δ) e C-3 (114,45 δ). Vale ressaltar, que os carbonos quaternários em 155,95; 155,69 e 154,71 δ, por serem coincidentes na projeção do mapa de contorno de HMBC, foram atribuídos (Tabela 2) por comparação com a 2'-metoxiflavona.13 O carbono carbonílico em 174,85 δ foi determinado como C-4 através de sua correlação (3J) com H-5 (8,23 δ). A espectrometria de massas com ionização por electrospray no modo positivo permitiu que fossem identificadas algumas das piranoflavonas presentes na mistura 2. Através desta técnica analí- tica, determinou-se o tamanho e as insaturações presentes na ca- deia alquílica das diferentes piranoflavonas que constituíam a mis- tura (Tabela 3). Entretanto, a posição da dupla ligação não pode ser determinada. Portanto, a mistura 2 é constituída por piranoflavonas inéditas que se distinguem no tamanho e nas insaturações da ca- deia alquílica (R). As substâncias isoladas foram testadas sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi nas concentrações de 500, 250 e 100 µg/ mL e os valores de IC50 foram calculados a partir dos valores de porcentagem de lise parasitária (% L.P.) obtidos nessas concentra- Tabela 3.

Os resultados (Tabela 4) mostram que dentre as substâncias testadas, as mais ativas foram os alcalóides 1 e 3, apresentando valo- res de IC50 de 136,9 e 144,9 µM, respectivamente. Entretanto, as substâncias testadas não mostraram ser potentes agentes tripanocidas, principalmente quando comparadas ao quimio-profilático violeta de genciana, cujo IC50 é de 83 µM, e com a lignana (-)-metilpluviatolídeo, que na concentração de 67,5 µM ocasionou 99% de lise parasitária.4 Apesar deste fato, os resultados dos testes tripanocidas sugeri- ram que as substâncias isoladas podem ser os princípios ativos das frações e extratos de C. heterophyllus, que foram ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Materiais e equipamentos Os espectros de RMN 1H, 13C e dos experimentos 2D foram obtidos em espectrômetros DRX-200 e ARX-400 da Bruker. Fo- ram utilizados CDCl3 ou CD3OD como solventes e tetrametilsilano (TMS) como padrão interno. O espectro de massas foi obtido por injeção direta em um equi- pamento Micromass Quattro LC, utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações A obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus estão descritos em Ambrozin et al.6 Isolamento das substâncias A mistura dos esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol foi obtida do extrato AHCH. Este extrato foi inicialmente submetido à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 4,7 x 23,9 cm), utilizan- do-se sílica gel (230-400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH], originando 8 frações. Da quarta fração (AHCH4; 521,3 mg) foi obtida a mistura de esteróides (120,6 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 3,8 x 29,3 cm) de sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH]. A fração AHFHD (2,0 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 4,1 x 44,8 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hex:CH2Cl2→MeOH], originando 7 frações. A quarta fração (AHFHD4; 309,1 mg) foi cromatografada em sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,0 x 47,0 cm) e eluída com MeOH, dando origem a 5 frações. A quinta fração (AHFHD4,5; 5,9 mg) foi identificada como o benzoato de β-sitosterila. A fração AHFHD5 (375,6 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna e à cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa. Tais técnicas per- mitiram a obtenção de 2,8 mg da mistura de piranoflavonas 2. Da fração AHFHA foram obtidas a flavona e a 7-metoxiflavona, segundo procedimento descrito em Ambrozin et al.6 Desta fração também foi isolada a 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHFHA (7,5 g) foi inicialmente submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 8,0 x 5,9 cm), utilizando-se florisil como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (hexano→MeOH), obtendo-se 6 frações. A fra- ção 3 (AHFHA3; 1,6 g) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel (230-400 mesh) (φ x h = 3,9 x 25,2 cm), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (9:1) → MeOH), dando origem a seis frações. A sexta fração (AHFHA3,6; 31,4 mg) foi recromatografada em coluna de sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,2 x 49,2 cm) e eluída com MeOH, originando 6 frações, das quais a sexta (AHFHA3,6,5; 5,2 mg) foi identificada como 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHCMA (2,4 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 3,2 x 53,0 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (CH2Cl2:MeOH (9,5:0,5) → MeOH), para dar origem a 4 frações. A primeira fração (AHCMA1; 872,0 mg) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (7:3) → MeOH), obtendo-se 8 frações. Da quarta fra- ção (AHCMA1,4; 15,5 mg) foi isolada a haplotusina (1) (5,3 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição isocrática (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Da oitava fração (AHCMA1,8; 129,2 mg) foi isolado o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4-quinolona (3) (22,1 mg), por cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Ensaio tripanocida Os ensaios com as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi foram realizados no Departamento de Análises Clínicas, Bromatológicas e Toxicológicas da FCFRP-USP, segundo procedimento descrito em Vieira et al.7 Para os ensaios foram utilizadas cepas “Y” de T. cruzi, que são mantidas através de passagens seriadas em camundongos, por meio de repiques semanais, no Laboratório de Parasitologia do Departa- mento de Ciências da Saúde da FCFRP-USP. Os ensaios biológicos das substâncias foram realizados utili- zando-se sangue de camundongos albinos Swiss, infectados pela cepa “Y” do T. cruzi, o qual foi obtido por punção cardíaca no pico da parasitemia (sétimo dia). Esse sangue foi diluído em sangue de animal sadio, de forma a se obter uma concentração final de 2x106 formas tripomastigotas por mL de sangue. Os ensaios foram reali- zados em microplacas de titulação (96 poços), onde o sangue infectado e as misturas (ou substâncias) a serem avaliadas foram solubilizados (em triplicata), e o material foi incubado por 24 h a 4 oC. Após este tempo, a contagem das formas tripomastigotas foi Tabela 4. Atividade tripanocida das substâncias isoladas de C. heterophyllus substância Concentração %L.P.

The phytochemical investigation of the flowers of Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae) resulted in the isolation and identification of nine phenolic derivatives, quercetin 3-O-sophoroside, taxifolin, astilbin, ourateacatechin, caffeic, ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic and gallic acid, besides two guanidine alkaloids, pterogynine, pterogynidine. This is the first time these compounds have been reported in P. nitens flowers. As this is a monospecific genus, these secondary metabolites may have taxonomical significance. Their structures were assigned on the basis of spectroscopic analyses, including two-dimensional NMR techniques. Keywords: Pterogyne nitens; flavonoids; guanidine alkaloids. INTRODUÇÃO Pterogyne nitens Tulasne (Fabaceae – Caesalpinioideae), uma espécie pertencente a um gênero monoespecífico, é popularmente conhecida como “amendoim-do-campo”, “amendoim-bravo”, “bál- samo”, “yvi-raró”, “cocal”, “tipa” etc. Na América Latina essa espécie arbórea ocorre na Argentina, Bolívia, Paraguai e Brasil. No território brasileiro ocorre com freqüência na região de Mata Atlântica e Cerrado compreendida entre o Ceará até o Paraná.1 “Amendoim-bravo”, como é popularmente conhecida no esta- do de São Paulo, é amplamente empregada na construção civil de- vido às características da sua madeira moderadamente densa e re- sistente.2 P. nitens também conhecida pela beleza e odor de suas flores, bem como pela intensidade de suas folhagens e frutificação possui grande valor ornamental sendo, portanto, recomendada para arborização de vias urbanas e rodovias e na reposição de mata ciliar em locais com inundações periódicas. Esta espécie habita os re- manescentes de vegetação paulista e encontra-se sob risco de extinção, fazendo parte da lista de espécies recomendadas para a conservação genética no estado de São Paulo.3 A literatura apresenta poucos dados das aplicações medicinais e da constituição química de P. nitens. Estudos etnofarmacológicos em comunidades guaranis do nordeste da Argentina revelam o uso das cascas do caule no tratamento de infestações parasitárias, prin- cipalmente no combate ao “tacho”, nome popular de Ascaris lumbricoides.4 Em trabalhos fitoquímicos anteriores, foram isola- dos cinco alcalóides guanidínicos das folhas e caules de P. nitens, os quais mostraram atividade citotóxica sobre linhagens mutantes de Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sugerindo atividade antitumoral po- tencial desses alcalóides.5 Dada a emergência de preservação da espécie ameaçada de extinção, o estudo sobre a composição micromolecular das flores de P. nitens foi bastante significativo para o registro do perfil meta- bólico da espécie. Desse estudo foram isolados e identificados onze constituintes: quatro flavonóides, quatro derivados do ácido cinâmico, dois alcalóides guanidínicos e o ácido gálico. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A identificação de todas as substâncias foi realizada com base na comparação de dados espectroscópicos de RMN de 1H, RMN de 13C, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY 1D e comparação desses dados com aqueles disponíveis na literatura. A análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracte- rizar as substâncias 1-4 como derivados do ácido cinâmico, com uma feição comum caracterizada por um par de dubletos entre δH 7,58-7,49 (J= 16,0 Hz; 1H) e δH 6,40-6,13 (J= 16,0 Hz; 1H), típi- cos do sistema trans-alceno de derivados aromáticos C6-C3. Os de- mais valores atribuídos aos sinais correspondentes ao anel aromá- tico demonstram sutis diferenças na série 1-4. Os sinais em δH 7,12 (d, J= 2,5 Hz), δH 7,04 (dd, J= 2,5 e 8,5 Hz) e δH 6,85 (d, J= 8,5 Hz) observados no espectro de RMN de 1H de 1 foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2, H-6 e H-5, respectivamente. Esses dados suge- rem a presença de um anel aromático 1,3,4-trissubstituído, permi- tindo concluir que o derivado de ácido cinâmico em análise é o ácido cafeico.6 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C da substância 2 apresentaram o mesmo perfil de sinais daqueles observados para 1, exceto pela presença do singleto em δH 3,90 (3H), atribuído a uma metoxila. A 803 Constituintes químicos das flores de Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae)# Vol. 31, No. 4 ligação do grupo metoxílico ao anel aromático foi estabelecida pela correlação observada entre os sinais em δH 3,90 (OCH3) e 147,9 (C-3), no mapa de contornos gHMBC. Assim, a substância 2 pôde ser caracterizada como sendo ácido ferúlico.7 Os espectros de RMN de 1H da substância 3 apresentaram dois singletos δH 6,98 (2H) e δH 3,80 (6H), os quais foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios metínicos H-2 e H-6 e aos dois grupos metoxílicos, respectivamente. Os de- mais dados espectrais confirmaram a posição dos dois grupos metoxílicos nos carbonos C-3 e C-5 e permitiram identificar a es- trutura molecular de 3 como sendo ácido sinápico.8 Os dados dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 4 foram quase similares àqueles observados para o ácido cafeico 1. Na estrutura de 4, além dos sinais de uma unidade de ácido cafeico analisados a partir dos es- pectros de RMN de 13C, foram diagnosticados um conjunto de si- nais compatíveis com uma unidade de ácido quínico. O espectro de RMN de 1H apresentou sinais para três hidrogênios metínicos em δH 3,56 (dd, J= 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-4), 3,92 (d, J= 3,5 Hz, H-4) e 5,06 (td, J= 3,5 e 10,0 Hz, H-5) e para hidrogênios metilênicos na região compreendida entre δH 1,08 e 1,99 (H-2 e H-6), os quais confirmaram a presença de uma unidade derivada do ácido quínico. A ligação do grupo cafeoíla à unidade de ácido quínico foi estabelecida pela correlação observada entre os sinais em δH 5,06 (H-5) e δC 165,7 (C-9’), no mapa de contornos gHMBC. Os valores observados para os acoplamentos de H-4 com H-3 e H-5 indicaram uma relação axial-equatorial entre H-4 e H-3 (J= 3,5 Hz) e axial- axial entre H-4 e H-5 (J = 10,0 Hz) confirmando as posições diequatoriais para os grupos cafeoíla e a hidroxila (4-OH). Os ex- perimentos de NOESY 1D mostraram um aumento na intensidade do sinal em δH 3,92 (H-3) pela irradiação do sinal atribuído ao hidrogênio H-4 (3,56) e ausência de NOE quando da irradiação do sinal em δH 5,06 (H-5), consolidando a configuração relativa pro- posta. Tais informações foram confirmadas com dados da literatu- ra, indicando que a estrutura de 4 corresponde ao ácido 5-O- cafeoilquínico.9 Os dados obtidos dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiram caracterizar a substância 5 como sendo ácido gálico.10 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiram inferir que a substância 6 pertence à classe dos flavonóides. Entre outras fei- ções destacam-se o conjunto de sinais do espectro de 13C em δC 73,6, 85,0 e 198,3 atribuídos aos carbonos C-3, C-2 e C-4, respec- tivamente, indicando que 6 possui a estrutura de um diidroflavonol. Um par de dubletos em δH 5,91 (J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) e δH 5,88 (J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) foram atribuídos ao anel A 5,7,9,10-tetrassubstituído. Os sinais em δH 6,96 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H), δH 6,80 (d, J= 8,0 Hz, 1H) e δH 6,84 (dd, J= 2,0 e 8,0 Hz, 1H) corroboram o padrão 1,3,4- trissubstituído para o anel B. Ainda o espectro de RMN de 1H de 6 apresentou um par de dubletos em δH 4,90 (J= 12,0 Hz, 1H) e 4,49 (J= 12,0 Hz, 1H), os quais foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2 e H-3, respectivamente. A constante de acoplamento apresentada por estes dois dubletos (J= 12 Hz) sugere um acoplamento do tipo axial- axial, conduzindo à proposição de que o anel B e o grupo hidroxila 3-OH mantém uma relação anti. Estes dados analisados em conso- nância com os de RMN de 13C permitiram caracterizar 6 como sendo taxifolina.11 Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C de 7 indica- ram uma estreita similaridade entre 6 e 7. A única diferença notada entre os espectros das duas substâncias refere-se aos sinais carac- terísticos de uma unidade glicosídica em 7. O sinal em δC 17,8, atribuído ao carbono metílico C-6” e o conjunto de sinais em δC 100,1 (C-1”), 71,7 (C-4”), 70,4 (C-3”), 70,1 (C-2”) e 69,0 (C-5”) permitiram caracterizar a unidade monosídica como sendo uma ramnose. O espectro de RMN de 1H demonstrou a presença de um dubleto em δH 4,04 que foi atribuído ao hidrogênio anomérico H- 1”, cuja constante de acoplamento de 1,5 Hz inferiu a configura- ção α para a unidade de ramnose. A correlação deste dubleto e o sinal em δC 75,7, atribuído ao carbono C-3, observada no mapa de contornos gHMBC, sugeriu que a unidade de ramnose se encontra ligada ao carbono C-3. Os dados espectroscópicos analisados para 7 indicaram tratar-se da estrutura da astilbina.12 A análise polarimétrica dos diidroflavonóis 6 e 7 indicou valores de rotação óptica específica de +17o (c= 1,02 MeOH, 27 oC) e –22 o (c= 0,82, MeOH, 27 oC), respectivamente. Esses dados sugerem as configu- rações absolutas R,R dos carbonos C-2 e C-3 presentes nas estrutu- ras moleculares de 6 e 7, os quais se mostraram compatíveis com os valores descritos na literatura.13 O espectro de RMN de 1H da substância 8 apresentou três si- nais característicos de hidrogênios aromáticos: δH 6,53 (s, 2H), 5,93 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) e 5,95 (d, J= 2,0 Hz, 1H) indicando tratar-se também de um flavonóide. Os sinais correspondentes a dois hidro- gênios metilênicos em δH 2,72 (dd, J= 3,0 e 17,0 Hz) e δH 2,86 (dd, J= 5,0 e 17,0 Hz) foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-4a e H-4b, respectivamente e permitiram atribuir a estrutura de uma catequina para 8. Os sinais relativos aos carbonos entre δC 100,1 e 157,9 e 29,1 analisados em conjunção com as correlações observadas no mapa de contornos gCOSY para os hidrogênios H-4a, H-4b e H-3 ajudaram a confirmar a proposição de uma catequina para 8. Os experimentos de NOESY 1D foram empregados visando confir- mar a estereoquímica relativa de C-2 e C-3. A irradiação em δH 2,73 (H-4a) causou aumento na intensidade do sinal em δH 4,19 (m, H-3). A irradiação do sinal em δH 2,86 (H-4b) também levou ao aumento de intensidade em δH 4,19 (H-3), indicando a proximi- dade destes hidrogênios. No entanto, pela intensidade dos NOE observados os sinais em δH 2,86 (H-4b) e δH 4,19 (H-3) estão posicionados na mesma face do plano do anel ao qual estão liga- dos. A irradiação do sinal em δH 2,73 (H-4a) também causou um incremento em δH 4,78 (sl, H-2), indicando uma correlação 1,3- diaxial entre H-4a e H-2. Ao irradiar-se o sinal em δH 4,19 (H-3), houve um ganho de intensidade em δH 4,78 (H-2) e δH 2,73 (H-4a) coerente com uma relação sin entre H-2, H-3 e H-4a. Estes dados analisados em consonância com as constantes de acoplamento destes sinais permitiram atribuir a configuração relativa proposta. O mapa de contornos gHMBC demonstrou uma intensa correlação entre o si- nal em δH 3,80 (s, 3H), atribuído a um hidrogênio metoxílico e o sinal em δC 136,0, o qual está relacionado ao carbono C-4’, sugerindo que o grupo metoxila se encontra ligado ao carbono C-4’. A medida da rota- ção óptica específica de 8 [α]D 27 = -58o (c= 1,22, acetona) indicou as 804 Quim. Nova Regasini et al. configurações R e R dos carbonos C-2 e C-3, similares aos valores encontrados para a epigalocatequina.14 Os dados apresentados são com- patíveis com estrutura da ourateacatequina,15 confirmando sua identi- dade com 8. A análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C permitiu caracte- rizar a substância 9 também como um flavonóide. O espectro de RMN de 13C apresentou os sinais em δC 177,3, 155,4 e 132,9 atri- buídos aos carbonos C-4, C-2 e C-3, respectivamente, evidencian- do a subclasse dos flavonóis. Os sinais em δC 144,7 e 148,7 atribu- ídos aos carbonos C-3’ e C-4’, respectivamente, evidenciaram um flavonol cujo anel B encontra-se 1’,3’,4’-trissubstituído. Adicio- nalmente, os sinais de RMN de 13C compreendidos entre δC 60,6 e δC 82,6 analisados com os sinais de RMN de 1H em δH 5,66 (d, J= 7,5 Hz, 1H) e δH 4,58 (d, J=7,5 Hz, 1H) correspondentes a dois hidrogênios anoméricos indicaram duas subunidades de glicose e, com base no valor da constante de acoplamento (J= 7,5 Hz) para estes dois dubletos, verificou-se tratar de duas subunidades de β- glicose. Os experimentos de gHMBC demonstraram duas correla- ções entre os dubletos em δH 5,66 e δH 4,58 atribuídos aos hidrogê- nios anoméricos H-1” e H-1’”, respectivamente, e o sinal em δH 82,6 sugerindo que a ligação interglicosídica seja do tipo 2”’→1’”. O mapa de contornos gHMBC de 9 também apresentou uma corre- lação entre o sinal em δC 132,9 atribuído ao carbono C-3 e o dubleto em δC 5,66, levando à conclusão que a posição de O-glicosilação se encontra em C-3. Pelos dados obtidos pode-se caracterizar 9 como sendo quercetina 3-O-soforosídeo.16 Análise dos dados de RMN de 13C das substância 10 e 11 indi- cou tratar-se de alcalóides de estruturas bastante similares. Entre outras características destacam-se a presença de sinais em torno de δC 155,7 e 156,9 (C-2) típico de carbono guanidínico e um conjun- to de cinco sinais relacionados às subunidades isoprenílicas em torno de δC 17,8/17,7; δC 25,2/25,1; δC 39,0/38,7; δC 119,2/119,0 e δC 135,8/136,0. A análise desses dados indicou que 10 e 11 contêm um núcleo guanidínico substituído por unidades hemiterpenoídicas. Dado evidenciado por dois singletos em δH 1,62 (H-4’) e δH 1,68 (H-5’) atribuídos aos hidrogênios dos grupos metílicos; um dubleto em δH 3,72 (d, J= 6,5, H-1’) e um tripleto em δH 5,16 (t, J= 6,5, H- 2’) relacionados aos hidrogênios metilênicos e metínico, respecti- vamente, para 10. Da mesma forma, dados similares caracteriza- ram a estrutura de 11, indicando que as estruturas em questão se tratam de alcalóides guanidino-prenilados. A única diferença entre os alcalóides 10 e 11 deve-se ao padrão de substituição do núcleo guanidínico. No alcalóide 10 o sinal δH 3,72 (J= 6,5 Hz), atribuído aos hidrogênios H-1’, apresenta-se como um dubleto devido ao acoplamento com H-2’. Adicionalmente, a ausência do hidrogênio azometínico na estrutura alcaloídica indicou o padrão N,N- dissubstituído para 10, que foi caracterizado como sendo a pteroginina.17 No alcalóide 11, a presença de um tripleto em δH 7,72 (t, J= 6,5, 1H) devido ao acoplamento do hidrogênio azometínico do núcleo guanidínico com H-1’ da unidade hemiterpênica indicou que a substituição terpênica ocorre nos ni- trogênios vicinais da estrutura guanidínica. Análise de todos os dados indica que 11 possui padrão N,N’ de substituição isoprenílica. Fundamentado nestas análises, a substância 11 foi caracterizada como a pteroginidina,5 um isômero constitucional do alcalóide 10. As substâncias 1-11 foram avaliadas quanto à sua capacidade de inibição sobre mieloperoxidase (MPO), uma heme-enzima abun- dante em polimorfonucleares (PMNs), e considerada uma macromolécula-chave na resposta imunológica inespecífica a vári- os agentes invasores, principalmente bactérias. A MPO é respon- sável pela conversão de peróxido de hidrogênio (H2O2) e ânions cloreto em água e ácido hipocloroso (HOCl) que, por sua vez, atua como um potente agente antimicrobiano. Além disso, o excesso da atividade de MPO e subseqüente produção exagerada de HOCl culmina em um intenso estresse oxidativo para os PMNs. A litera- tura correlaciona essa injúria oxidativa promovida por MPO e HOCl com inúmeros processos inflamatórios, tais como artritite reumatóide, fibrose cística, doença inflamatória intestinal (IBD), injúria pulmonar neonatal, etc. Dessa forma, a busca por inibidores de MPO a partir de fontes naturais torna-se de grande valia na descoberta de novos agentes anti-inflamatórios.18 Dentre as substâncias ensaiadas com MPO, apenas as substân- cias 5 e 9 mostraram-se ativas, exibindo CI50 de 17,5 e 3,72 nM, quando comparadas à quercetina, utilizada como controle positi- vo, que apresentou uma CI50 de 1,22 nM. O valor de CI50 da quercetina apresenta-se inferior àquele observado para o seu glicosídeo 9, sugerindo a importância de uma hidroxila livre na posição 3 para atividade de inibição de MPO. As demais substân- cias mostraram-se inativas (CI50 > 100 nM), incluindo a substância 6, um análogo hidrogenado da quercetina. Essa observação sugere que uma insaturação situada entre os carbonos C-2 e C-3 no núcleo flavonoídico para uma ação inibitória sobe MPO. Os extratos e frações obtidas das flores de P. nitens tiveram sua capacidade antioxidante avaliada no ensaio em cromatoplacas re- veladas com β-caroteno, mostrando-se ativos, uma vez que manti- veram a coloração laranja nos pontos de aplicação. As substâncias fenólicas isoladas neste estudo são provavelmente as responsáveis pela atividade antioxidante dessas frações detectadas pelo teste preliminar com β-caroteno e que foi anteriormente relatado por Cai e colaboradores, que demonstraram a capacidade seqüestrado- ra de radicais livres das substâncias 1-9 nos ensaios com DPPH (2,2-difenil-1-picrilidrazila) e ABTS [2,2’-azino-di-(3-etillben- zotiazolina-6-ácido sulfônico)].19 A atividade seqüestradora de ra- dicais exibida pelos derivados fenólicos vem sendo amplamente discutida na literatura e está correlacionada a fatores mesoméricos que conferem a esse grupo funcional uma alta reatividade como doadores de elétrons.20 Os alcalóides guanidínicos 10 e 11 tiveram seu poder antioxidante avaliado sobre os radicais DPPH e ABTS. Os resultados indicaram que os alcalóides são inativos no teste com DPPH (CI50 > 200 μM) e mostraram atividade baixa sobre o radical ABTS, apresentando CI50 de 87,7 e 190,0 μM, tendo a quercetina como controle positivo (CI50 de 7,64 e 3,12 μM para os radicais DPPH e ABTS, respectivamente). O estudo químico das flores de P. nitens culminou no isola- mento de onze substâncias de três classes químicas distintas: flavonóides (flavonóis, diidroflavonóis e catequinas), derivados do ácido cinâmico e alcalóides. Dentre esses, somente as substâncias 10 e 11 já haviam sido relatadas como pertencentes ao metaboloma de P. nitens. Este trabalho permitiu concluir ainda que os metabólitos secundários acumulados nas flores desta espécie são predominan- temente de natureza fenólica. A descrição dos constituintes acu- mulados em P. nitens é também de grande valia tendo em conta que sua madeira vem sendo empregada indiscriminadamente pela construção civil e, por tratar-se de um gênero monoespecífico, esta leguminosa está seriamente ameaçada de extinção.2 PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C e experimentos bidimensionais foram realizados em espectrômetro Varian INOVA-500® operando a 500 MHz para o núcleo de 1H e 125 MHz para o núcleo de 13C, TMS foi utilizado como referência interna. Os dados de rotação óptica foram obtidos em polarímento Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena®. As análises por CLAE no modo analítico foram realizadas em equi- 805 Constituintes químicos das flores de Pterogyne nitens (Caesalpinioideae)# Vol. 31, No. 4 pamento ProStar/Varian® acoplado ao detector ProStar 330® de ar- ranjos de diodos, utilizando coluna analítica Phenomenex® Fenil- Hexila (250 x 4,60 mm; 5 µm). No modo preparativo, as análises por CLAE foram realizadas em equipamento ProStar/Varian® acoplado ao detector ProStar-UV®, utilizando-se coluna Phenomenex Fenil-Hexila (250 x 21,2 mm; 10 μm). Nas separa- ções em coluna aberta foram utilizadas gel de sílica derivatizado C-18 (40-63 μm, Merck®), gel de sílica para cromatografia flash (35-70 μm) e para cromatografia de exclusão molecular (Sephadex,® LH-20). As análises por cromatografia em camada delgada foram realizadas com cromatoplacas de gel de sílica G60 (0,25 mm). Após o desenvolvimento das cromatoplacas estas foram visualizadas sob luz ultravioleta (λ = 254 e 365 nm) e reveladas com solução de anisaldeído em ácido sulfúrico seguido de aquecimento. Material vegetal As flores de P. nitens foram coletadas no Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo – SP, no mês de abril de 2003, pela Dra. M. C. M. Young. O material botânico foi identificado como sendo Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae – Caesalpinoideae) pela Dra. I. Cordeiro, do mesmo Ins- tituto. Uma exsicata (SP204319) encontra-se depositada no herbário “Maria Eneida P. Kaufmann” do Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo - SP. Extração e isolamento As flores (1,8 kg) foram secas à temperatura ambiente por 15 dias e, posteriormente, submetidas à moagem empregando moi- nho de facas. O pó obtido (1,5 kg) foi levado à maceração empre- gando hexanos e posteriormente maceração em etanol. Após eva- poração, o extrato hexânico (3,8 g) foi analisado por RMN de 1H e CCDC mostrando tratar-se de uma mistura complexa de terpenos. O extrato etanólico (15,0 g) foi dissolvido em uma mistura de metanol:água (7:3) e posteriormente submetido à partição líquido- líquido empregando acetato de etila e n-butanol. A fração AcOEt (3,8 g) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna de permeação em gel (Sephadex®, LH-20, 180 x 5 cm), eluída em MeOH, obtendo-se 25 subfrações de 75 mL. A subfração AcOEt-17 (143,0 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia flash em coluna de gel de sílica (28 x 3 cm), eluída em modo gradiente (CHCl3:MeOH, 100 a 50%), obtendo-se os ácidos cafeico (1; 12, 0 mg), ferúlico (2; 14,0 mg) e sinápico (3, 7,0 mg). A subfração AcOEt-20 (79 mg) foi subme- tida à cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (8 x 3 cm) empregando misturas de MeOH:H2O (30 a 80%), resultando no isolamento de dois flavonóides, taxifolina (6, 14 mg) e ourateacatequina (8, 15 mg). A fração n-butanólica (3,0 g) foi submetida à cromatografia por exclusão molecular (LH-20, Sephadex, 180 x 5 cm) eluída em MeOH, resultando em 22 subfrações de 70 mL. A subfração BuOH- 7 (280 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia em coluna de gel de sílica (28 x 4 cm), eluída em misturas de CHCl3:MeOH (10 a 30%), obtendo-se dois alcalóides guanidínicos, pteroginina (10, 98 mg) e pteroginidina (11, 90 mg). A subfração BuOH-12 (120 mg) foi sub- metida à cromatografia em coluna de fase reversa (10 x 3 cm), eluída em MeOH:H2O (1:1), obtendo-se astilbina (7, 27 mg). A subfração BuOH-18 (97 mg) foi submetida à CLAE-UV preparativo [MeOH:H2O (56:44), λ = 254 nm, fluxo = 11,0 mL/min), culmi- nando no isolamento do flavonol glicosilado (9, 18 mg). A fração hidroalcoólica (1,7 g) foi inicialmente submetida à cromatografia de permeação em gel (Sephadex®, LH-20, 120 x 8 cm), eluída em MeOH, obtendo-se 13 subfrações de 35 mL. A subfração HA-5 foi identificada como ácido gálico (5, 11 mg) e a subfração HA-12, como sendo o ácido 5-O-cafeoilquínico (4, 22 mg). Atividades antioxidante e inibitória sobre mieloperoxidase (MPO) Para os ensaios em CCD reveladas com β-caroteno, as amos- tras foram eluídas e reveladas com uma solução diclorometânica de β-caroteno a 0,02%. Após revelação, a cromatoplaca foi mantida à exposição de luz solar até total perda de coloração. Os pontos que mantiveram a coloração laranja indicaram a presença de subs- tâncias antioxidantes.21 Os ensaios de capacidade seqüestradora de radicais livres realizados para as substâncias 10 e 11 seguiram pro- tocolos relatados na literatura com pequenas modificações.22 A atividade inibitória sobre MPO das substâncias 1-11 foi avalia- da segundo o método de oxidação do guaiacol. O meio reacional cons- tituído de uma mistura de MPO (8,0 nM), peróxido de hidrogênio (0,3 mM) e guaiacol (70 mM) foi utilizado para a avaliação da ação de MPO na presença das substâncias em estudo e do controle positivo quercetina. As substâncias foram dissolvidas em DMSO nas concen- trações 0,50; 5,0; 10,0; 25,0; 50,0 e 100 nM. Após o tempo de reação (4 h), o meio reacional foi lido em espectrofotômetro (470 nm). A atividade inibitória foi expressa em CI50, valor calculado a partir da plotagem de um gráfico correlacionando velocidade inicial versus absorbância, obtendo-se, assim, as curvas concentração-resposta.23 AGRADECIMENTOS À Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), Programa BIOTA-FAPESP (Instituto Virtual da Biodiversidade, www.biota.org.br), Conselho Nacional de Desen- volvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) e à Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).

INTRODUÇÃO Espécies da família Fabaceae são amplamente distribuídas em regiões tropicais e subtropicais e divididas em três subfamílias: Caesalpinoideae, Mimosoideae e Papilionoideae.1 O gênero Swartzia pertence à subfamília Caesalpinoideae e inclui 150 espécies, distri- buídas pelas Américas do Sul e Central e África. Na América do Sul, o centro de maior diversidade desse gênero está na região amazôni- ca. No Brasil, além da região amazônica, existe uma considerável representatividade de espécies na região sudeste.1,2 Swartzia langsdorffii pertence à subfamília Caesalpinoideae, e é popularmente conhecida como banana-de-papagaio, jacarandá-ba- nana e jacarandá-de-sangue. Na região sudeste, é encontrada nos estados do Rio de Janeiro e de São Paulo nas formações florestais do complexo atlântico, principalmente na Serra do Mar.3 A árvore é ornamental, principalmente quando em flor, e seus frutos são muito procurados por várias espécies da fauna, que se alimentam do arilo suculento que envolve parcialmente a semente. Por essa razão, essa árvore é interessante para plantio em áreas degradadas para preser- vação permanente.3 O gênero Swartzia é caracterizado pela presen- ça de isoflavonóides, saponinas triterpênicas e diterpenos aromáti- cos.2,4-7 Espécies deste gênero apresentam constituintes químicos com atividade antimicrobiana,4 antifúngica,5 moluscicida6 e citotóxica,2,7 o que mostra a importância da investigação adicional sobre aspectos fitoquímicos e/ou farmacológicos destas espécies. Em nosso programa de bioprospecção, o extrato de Swartzia langsdorffii destacou-se pela marcante atividade antifúngica frente a fitopatógenos e patógenos humanos. Os fungos são amplamente asso- ciados a doenças oportunistas e tem-se observado aumento no núme- ro de pacientes com alterações no estado imunológico associado ao vírus da imunodeficiência adquirida (HIV), à quimioterapia do cân- cer e transplante de órgãos e de sangue. Coincidindo com esse aumen- to de pacientes imunocomprometidos tem ocorrido um aumento da incidência de micoses sistêmicas humanas.8 Cryptococcus neoformans, destacado como uma das principais infecções em pacientes aidéticos, e Candida sp, descrita em 20 a 40% de pacientes com câncer e em aproximadamente 25% dos pacientes que recebem transplantes de medula óssea,9 são alvos de enorme importância. Apesar da existência de potentes agentes antifúngicos como a anfotericina B, o apareci- mento de resistência ou multi-resistência de fungos impõe a necessi- dade de pesquisas permanentes e o desenvolvimento de novas dro- gas.8,10 Visto que as plantas produzem uma variedade de compostos com propriedades antifúngicas, é esperado que programas de bioprospecção sistemática informem fontes de substâncias candidatas ao desenvolvimento de novas drogas com estas propriedades.11 Estu- dos de bioprospecção preliminares com plantas da Mata Atlântica le- varam à seleção de extratos bioativos, dentre os quais, destacou-se o extrato de Swartzia langsdorffii, coletada na Reserva Juréia-Itatins, em Iguape – SP, que apresentou marcada atividade antifúngica e foi selecionado para estudo fitoquímico visando o isolamento e identifi- cação de seus constituintes químicos bioativos. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Materiais e equipamentos A rotação óptica foi medida em polarímetro Perkin-Elmer mode- lo 341 usando lâmpada de sódio (589 nm) a 20 0C. Espectros de mas- sas foram medidos em espectrômetro UltrO-TOFq (Bruker-Daltonics). As análises foram realizadas em modo eletrospray (negativo, 100% MeOH, injeção da amostra através de seringa de infusão Harvard Apparatus Pump11, com fluxo de 10 µL/min). Os experi- mentos de RMN de 1H e 13C em uma e duas dimensões foram feitos em instrumento Varian Inova 500 operando a 500 MHz para hidro- gênio e 125 MHz para carbono usando seqüências de pulso padrão (Varian). DMSO-d6 foi usado como solvente e TMS, como padrão interno. A cromatografia planar (CCD) foi realizada em placas de alumínio cobertas de sílica-gel (sílica F254, 0.25 mm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) com detecção por luz UV (254 e 366 nm) e nebulização com anisaldeído sulfúrico seguida de aquecimento (120 829 Saponinas antifúngicas de Swartzia langsdorffii Vol. 31, No. 4 °C). Sílica gel (230-400 mesh ASTM, tamanho de partícula 0,040- 0,063 µm, Merck) ou Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) foram usadas em fracionamento por coluna cromatográfica. As separações por cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE) foram realizadas em cromatógrafo analítico ternário Varian Pro Star modelo 240, com auto injetor Varian Pro Star modelo 410, detector UV-Diode-Array modelo 330, ou cromatógrafo analítico Shimadzu, bombas LC-10AD, com auto-injetor SIL 10A/ CBM 10A, detector Diode-Array modelo SPDM 10AVP e colunas analítica e preparativa “Luna” Phenomenex (250 mm x 4,6 mm e 250 mm x 21 mm, respectivamente). Material vegetal Folhas de Swartzia langsdorffii foram coletadas na Reserva da Juréia, Iguape – SP, em outubro de 2004. A identificação foi reali- zada pela Dra. I. Cordeiro (IBt – SMA, SP) e a excicata (Cordeiro 1913) foi depositada no herbário do Instituto de Botânica da Se- cretaria do Meio Ambiente, IBt – SMA São Paulo. Extração e isolamento dos constituintes químicos O material vegetal seco e moído (270 g) foi extraído com EtOH a temperatura ambiente. Após concentração sob pressão reduzida, o extrato etanólico (4,4 g) foi submetido à partição com solventes orgâ- nicos, fornecendo as frações obtidas com hexano (FH, 1,5 g), AcOEt (FA, 1,0 g) e MeOH/H2O (FM, 1,5 g). A avaliação da atividade antifúngica do extrato bruto e das frações obtidas de partição revelou a presença de substâncias bioativas em FA e FM. O fracionamento de FA por cromatografia em coluna (sílica-gel, gradiente Hexano/AcOEt/ MeOH) forneceu 12 frações (A1-A12). A análise por CCD (AcOEt/ MeOH 13:7) e CLAE (C-18, MeOH/H2O 55:45, detecção em 235 nm) e o resultado da avaliação de atividade antifúngica orientaram a sele- ção de A6 e A7, que foram reunidas e purificadas por CLAE (C18, MeOH/H2O 55:45, detecção em 235 nm, fluxo 12 mL/min), fornecen- do a substância 2 (17 mg). O fracionamento de FM (1,5 g) por cromatografia em coluna (Sephadex LH-20, eluição com MeOH) for- neceu 49 subfrações, cuja análise por CCD (AcOEt/MeOH 9:11) ori- entou seu agrupamento em 9 frações (M1-M9). A análise das frações reunidas por CLAE (C-18, MeOH/H2O 43:57, detecção em 235 nm) e o resultado da avaliação de atividade antifúngica orientaram a seleção da fração M6 (55 mg), que foi purificada por CLAE (C18, MeOH/H2O 43:57, detecção em 235 nm, fluxo 12 mL/min), fornecendo a substân- cia 1 (22 mg). O fracionamento de FH (1,5 g) por cromatografia em coluna (sílica-gel, gradiente Hexano/AcOEt) forneceu 30 subfrações, que foram analisadas por CCD e agrupadas em 4 frações (H1-H4). A análise por CCD (Hexano/AcOEt 4:1) orientou a seleção de H3 e H4, que foram purificadas por CCD preparativa (Hexano/AcOEt 9:1, 3 eluições), fornecendo as substâncias 3 (17 mg) e 4 (8 mg). Atividade antifúngica Ensaio com fungos patogênicos humanos em microplacas Os microrganismos usados na avaliação de atividade antifúngica foram Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Candida krusei ATCC 6258, Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 e Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC 90012, crescidos e mantidos em meio de ágar Sabouraud-dextrose por 24 h para as espécies de Candida e por 48 h para Cryptococcus neoformans, em temperatura ambiente. O método utilizado para ava- liação da atividade foi microdiluição em caldo, descrito no docu- mento M27-A2 do Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI),12 com modificações. O meio usado foi RPMI 1640 com L- glutamina em tampão a pH 7,0 com ácido morfolinopropano- sulfônico (MOPS) 0,165 M, suplementado com glicose 2%. Os ex- tratos, frações ou substâncias puras foram dissolvidos em DMSO em concentrações decrescentes a partir de 250 até 0,4 µg/mL, e adi- cionados às microplacas de 96 cavidades contendo meio RPMI. As suspensões celulares contendo fungos foram preparadas em solução salina 0,85% e diluídas 1:100 em RPMI até concentração final de 1×104 a 5×104 unidades formadoras de colônias por mL (CFU/mL). Cada suspensão foi inoculada nas microplacas previamente prepara- das com as amostras teste, que foram incubadas com agitação a 37 °C por 24 h para Candida sp. e 48 h para Cryptococcus neoformans. Anfotericina B (0,03 a 16 µg/mL) foi usada como droga controle. A concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) foi definida como a menor concentração de amostra que inibiu completamente o crescimento do fungo. Pelo método espectrofotométrico, a CIM foi definida como a menor concentração em que a densidade óptica foi reduzida a 90% daquela observada para a solução controle (sem amostra). Os resul- tados foram analisados visual e espectrofotometricamente. Amos- tras que apresentaram CIM menor que 75,0 µg/mL foram considera- das com boa atividade; CIM entre 75,0 e 150,0 µg/mL indicou ativi- dade moderada; CIM entre 150,0 e 250,0 µg/mL indicou atividade fraca e, para CIM maior que 250,0 µg/mL a amostra foi considerada inativa. Bioautografia com fungos fitopatogênicos Os microrganismos usados na avaliação de atividade antifúngica foram Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum, cres- cidos e mantidos em meio de ágar Sabouraud-dextrose. Cada amos- tra foi submetida à análise em CCD e, depois de seca, a placa cromatográfica foi nebulizada com suspensão dos esporos dos fun- gos Cladosporium cladosporioides ou C. sphaerospermum. As pla- cas foram mantidas a 25 oC no escuro por 48-72 h. Foi possível observar o crescimento dos fungos sobre as placas, exceto nos lo- cais em que substâncias antifúngicas estavam presentes, os quais permaneceram brancos. As zonas de inibição foram medidas e com- paradas com as substâncias padrão nistatina e miconazol.13 RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O fracionamento cromatográfico do extrato EtOH das folhas de S. langsdorffii forneceu o 3-O-β-D-(6’-metil)-glicopiranosil- olean-28-oato de β-glucopiranosila (1), ácido 3-O-β-glicopiranosil- (1→2)-β-D-glucopiranosil-oleanólico (2, ácido 3-soforosil- oleanólico), ácido oleanólico (3) e lupeol (4). A substância 1 foi obtida como sólido amorfo, com [α]D 30 +31 (MeOH, c 0,021) e seu espectro de massas mostrou um íon [M-H]+ em m/z 793 (100), enquanto o espectro de massas de alta resolução mostrou sinal do íon [M]+ em m/z 794,4788, compatível com a fórmula molecular C43H70O13 (massa calculada 794,4816), consis- tente com a estrutura de uma saponina (Figura 1).

Estruturas das saponinas isoladas de Swartzia langsdorffii 830 Quim. Nova de Marqui et al. região de infra-vermelho em 1736 cm-1 indicaram a presença de um grupo carbonílico de éster. A análise do espectro de RMN de 1H da substância 1 mostrou sinais para sete metilas alifáticas (δH 0,8 a 1,1), sinais para hidrogênios hidroximetínicos (δH 3,0 e 4,5), além de outros sinais entre δH 1,0 e 2,5 sugerindo a estrutura de um triterpeno glicosilado (saponina) (Tabela 1). O espectro de RMN de 13C mostrou sinais em δC 121,7 e 143,4 sugerindo o esqueleto oleanano para a substância 1; um sinal em δC 175,3, compatível com uma carboxila e sinais em δC 94,1 e 105,3, que mostraram correlação com os dubletos em δH 5,23 (J = 7,5 Hz) e δH 4,13 (J = 7,5 Hz) no mapa de correlações HMQC, que permitiu suge- rir a presença de duas unidades glicosídicas em 1.14,15 Observou-se ainda neste mapa de contorno um sinal em δCH3 53,4 correlacionado ao singleto em δH 3,1, correspondente ao grupo metoxila, além de sinais para carbonos metínicos em δCH 40,7 e 47,1, correlacionados ao duplo dubleto largo em δH 2,73 e ao multipleto em δH 1,48, que permi- tiram sua atribuição a H-18 e H-9, respectivamente. O experimento HMBC mostrou correlações dos dubletos em δH 5,23 e 4,13, atribuí- dos aos hidrogênios anoméricos, com os sinais em δC 175,3 (C) e 87,8 (CH) que foram atribuídos à carboxila do C-28 e ao C-3, respectiva- mente, evidenciando as posições de substituição das duas unidades glicosídicas na aglicona triterpênica (Figura 2). Adicionalmente, este experimento mostrou a correlação entre o sinal em δCH2 67,0 (C-6”), e o singleto em δH 3,1, permitindo a proposta de metilação na hidroxila em C-6”. A análise detalhada deste mapa mostrou correlações entre os hidrogênios metílicos e carbonos a 2 ou 3 ligações, o que, em conjun- to com a comparação dos seus dados espectrométricos com a literatu- ra,2,15 permitiu confirmar a estrutura proposta para a substância 1, o ácido 3-O-β-D-(6’-metil)glicopiranosil-28-O-β-D-glucopiranosil- oleanólico, inédita na literatura. A substância 2 foi obtida como sólido amorfo e seu espectro de massas mostrou um pico em m/z 779 (100%) que pode ser atribuí- do ao íon [M-H]+. Este valor é compatível com a fórmula molecular C42H68O13, que está de acordo com a estrutura de uma saponina triterpênica com duas unidades de glicose. Os dados de RMN de 1H e de 13C foram semelhantes aos da saponina 1, evidenciando uma aglicona com esqueleto oleanano, através dos sinais em δC 123,6 e 145,2, atribuídos a C-12 e C-13 e a presença de duas unida- des glicosídicas, em função dos sinais para dois hidrogênios (δH 4,37 e 4,56) e dois carbonos anoméricos (δC 106,3 e 103,1). O experimento HMBC indicou correlações entre C-3 e H-1’ e entre C-2’ e H-1”, que evidenciaram a posição da ligação da aglicona com uma unidade glicosídica, bem como da ligação interglicosídica, e permitiram identificar a substância 2 com o ácido 3-O-β- glicopiranosil-(1→2)-β-D-glucopiranosil-oleanólico, anteriormente isolado de S. schomburgkii.2,15 As substâncias 3 e 4 foram obtidas como sólidos amorfos e seus dados de EM obtidos por ionização por eletrospray e de RMN uni e bidimensionais, bem como comparação com dados da litera- tura,14 permitiram identificá-las como os triterpenos pentacíclicos ácido oleanólico (3) e lupeol (4), amplamente distribuídos no reino vegetal. A seleção do extrato de S. langsdorffii para estudo fitoquímico visando o isolamento de seus constituintes potencialmente antifúngicos baseou-se no resultado positivo (CIM 125,0 µg/mL) obtido frente às linhagens de fungos patogênicos humanos Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis e Cryptococcus neoformans, indicando atividade antifúngica moderada. A avalia- ção das fases de partição, FA e FM (CIM 125,0 µg/mL), confirmou a bioatividade observada inicialmente e orientou a escolha das fra- ções promissoras para purificação das substâncias bioativas. As substâncias purificadas 1-4 também foram avaliadas por suas pro- Tabela 1.

As saponinas 1 e 2, obtidas de FM e FA, respectivamente, mostraram-se moderadamente ativas (CIM 100,0 µg/mL), enquanto a substância 3 se mostrou fracamente ativa (CIM 200,0 µg/mL) e 4 foi inativa frente aos fungos patogênicos usados neste estudo. As substâncias 1-4 foram também avaliadas por bioautografia frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. As substâncias 1-3 mostraram-se mode- radamente ativas, com halos de inibição de 15, 12 e 11 mm, en- quanto 4 mostrou-se inativa, confirmando a tendência observada anteriormente da atividade antifúngica do ácido oleanólico e seus derivados.16 CONCLUSÃO O estudo da espécie S. langsdorffii mostrou a presença de saponinas nas subfrações provenientes das fases de partição em AcOEt e aquosa. Verificou-se ainda a presença de triterpenos pentacíclicos na fase hexânica, sendo isolados e identificados o lupeol e o ácido oleanólico. A avaliação da atividade antifúngica do extrato bruto das folhas de S. langsdorffii e de suas fases de partição orientou a busca das substâncias bioativas, que resultou no isolamento das saponinas antifúngicas a partir das frações mais polares. Esses resultados corroboram a importância do estudo fitoquímico guiado por bioensaios como estratégia efetiva para ati- vidades de bioprospecção.

An evaluation of the insecticidal activity of the fruits extracts of Trichilia claussenii was carried out and the methanol extract revealed to have strong insecticidal activity. The fractionation of methanol extract of T. claussenii seeds bioassay-guided against Spodoptera frugiperda has led to the identification of the ω-phenylalkyl and alkenyl fatty acids as active compounds in this extract. The structures of the compounds were proposed by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data. Keywords: Trichilia claussenii; ω-phenylalkyl and alkenyl fatty acids; Spodoptera frugiperda. INTRODUÇÃO O milho representa um dos principais cereais em todo mundo e é cultivado em pequenas, médias e grandes propriedades. No Brasil é considerada como cultura de expressão nacional, de grande importância social e econômica, e está presente de norte a sul do País.1 São utilizados, durante o desenvolvimento da cultura, insu mos sintéticos como pesticidas que, além de aumentar os custos de produção, poluem o ambiente e deixam resíduos nos alimentos. O controle de pragas é uma das atividades de importância econômica que deve ser bem planejada para a obtenção de maiores rendimentos econômicos.2 A lagarta-do-cartucho, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), destaca-se como importante praga do milho, tanto pela redução da produtividade e da qualidade do produto final, quanto pela dificuldade de controle.2,3 Um dos primeiros relatos da atividade inseticida de Trichilia spp. sobre S. frugiperda foi feito por Mikolajczak e Reed.4 Expe rimentos realizados adicionando extratos aquosos de T. casaretti, T. catigua, T. claussenii, T. elegans e T. pallida à dieta artificial afetaram o desenvolvimento das lagartas de S. frugiperda.5 Ex tratos orgânicos das folhas, ramos e frutos de T. claussenii e dos frutos de T. catigua, T. elegans foram avaliados sobre S. frugiperda em condições de laboratório.6,7 Os extratos hexânico e metanólico de folhas e o hexânico de ramos de T. claussenii foram os mais eficientes, apresentando alta taxa de mortalidade larval (superior a 60,0%).6 Dentre os frutos, os melhores resultados foram apre sentados pelos extratos hexânico e metanólico de T. elegans com mortalidade larval de 100,0%.7 O estudo químico das folhas de T. claussenii resultou no isola mento de um cicloartano, uma mistura de ácidos w-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos, aminoácidos e um sesquiterpeno;8 dos galhos foram isolados esteroides pregnanos e sesquiterpenos9 e, dos frutos, novas g-lactonas.10 Em vista do exposto, desenvolveu-se este trabalho com o objetivo de avaliar a bioatividade de extratos orgânicos e dos constituintes químicos dos frutos de T. claussenii sobre S. frugiperda. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os espectros de RMN de 1H e 13C foram obtidos em espectrômetro Bruker DRX operando a 400 MHz para 1H, utilizando-se CDCl3 como solvente e TMS como padrão interno. As separações cromatográficas em colunas foram realizadas utilizando-se gel de sílica 60, 70-230, 230-400 mesh. As análises cro matográficas em camada fina foram realizadas em cromatoplacas de sílica gel F254 sobre placa de alumínio Merck, de 0,2 mm de espessura, empregando-se como revelador a solução de vanilina/ácido sulfúrico. Para identificação dos ésteres metílicos do conjunto dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos foi utilizado cromatógrafo gasoso acoplado ao espectrômetro de massas, marca Shimadzu, modelo QP-5000, com coluna capilar DB-5 (30 m x 0,25 mm x 0,15 μm), utilizando as seguintes condições: temperatura do detector: 280 °C, injetor: 250 °C, gás de arraste: He, temperatura inicial do forno: 70°C por 2 min, velocidade de aquecimento a 10 °C/min até 290 °C, permanecendo nessa temperatura por 20 min. O espectro de massas foi obtido por impacto de elétrons a 70 eV. Material vegetal Os frutos de T. claussenii foram coletados em Piracicaba/SP no Campus da Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz”/USP, e identificados pelo botânico Dr. R. R. Rodrigues. Uma exsicata foi depositada no herbário da Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz” sob o número 7395. Preparação dos extratos Os frutos de T. claussenii foram secos em estufa de circulação de ar a 40 °C, por aproximadamente 7 dias e posteriormente separados em cascas do fruto (pericarpo, TCCF, 56,8 g), cascas da semente (arilo, TCCS, 7,90 g), semente (TCS, 35,1 g). A extração das partes dos frutos de T. claussenii foi realizada por maceração a tempera tura ambiente e em repouso, com solventes em ordem crescente de polaridade (hexano, MeOH e MeOH/água 1:1). As soluções obtidas Nebo et al. 1850 Quim. Nova foram concentradas por destilação do solvente em evaporador rotati vo, fornecendo os extratos hexânico, metanólico e hidrometanólico, respectivamente. Os extratos foram submetidos a ensaios de toxici dade sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho do milho, S. frugiperda, e os que apresentaram atividade foram fracionados. Ensaio de toxicidade Os ensaios biológicos sobre S. frugiperda foram realizados no Laboratório de Bioensaios do Departamento de Química da UFSCar, a 25 ± 1 °C, UR de 70 ± 5% e fotofase de 12 h. Para realização dos testes, a criação de S. frugiperda (J. E. Smith) foi mantida em labo ratório, sendo as lagartas alimentadas com dieta artificial e os adultos com solução de mel a 10%.11 Os ensaios de toxicidade basearam-se na metodologia descrita por Paula et al..12 Para realização dos bioensaios, foram preparadas solu ções das amostras em acetona e/ou água. Foram utilizados grupos de 10 larvas de S. frugiperda no segundo instar (5 dias), onde cada grupo foi transferido para placas de Petri. As médias dos pesos dos grupos de insetos foram obtidas pelas medidas realizadas em balança analítica. Em cada inseto, 1 μL da solução em acetona ou água foi aplicado topicamente, via uma microsseringa. Para evitar a possível morte do inseto, em cada grupo de larvas foi colocada pequena porção (300,0 mg) da dieta artificial. Este processo foi realizado 1 h após a aplicação da solução. O controle consistiu na aplicação de 1 μL de acetona ou água em cada inseto e foi realizado utilizando as mesmas condições descritas anteriormente. Todos os experimentos e o respectivo controle foram realizados em triplicata. Todos os ensaios foram realizados na concentração de 10 mg/mL e a mortalidade dos insetos foi verificada após 48 h. Os resultados foram expressos em média da porcentagem da mortalidade e analisados utilizando-se a análise de variância (ANOVA), sendo usado P < 0,05 como nível de significância. Isolamento e identificação dos constituintes químicos de T. claussenii O extrato metanólico das sementes de T. claussenii (TCSM, 4,54 g) foi suspenso em uma mistura MeOH/H2O (7:3) e particio nado sucessivamente com hexano, CH2Cl2, AcOEt e MeOH/H2O, obtendo-se após a evaporação dos solventes as frações: TCSM1 = 0,37 g ; TCSM2 = 0,06 g ; TCSM3 = 1,00 g e TCSM4 = 3,10 g, respectivamente. As frações obtidas foram submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade sobre S. frugiperda. A fração bioativa TCSM1 (0,37 g) foi fracionada em coluna de gel de sílica (70-230 mesh) empregando-se como eluentes: hexano 100%, hexano/AcOEt (99:1/98:2/95:5/9:1/8: 2/7:3/1:1), AcOEt 100%, AcOEt/MeOH (99:1/98:2/95:5/9:1/8:2/7:3 /1:1) e MeOH 100%; as frações obtidas foram reunidas em 6 frações (TCSM1-1 a TCSM1-6) com base na semelhança revelada pela aná lise por cromatografia em camada fina e, posteriormente, submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade. As sub-frações bioativas TCSM1-3 (0,05 g) e TCSM1-4 (0,20 g) foram fracionadas em gel de sílica (70-230 mesh), utilizando como eluente hexano/AcOEt/MeOH (hexano/ AcOEt (8:2/7:3/1:1), AcOEt 100%, AcOEt/MeOH (99:1/98:2/95:5/9: 1/8:2/7:3/1:1) e MeOH 100%) em gradiente de polaridade crescente. Através das similaridades cromatográficas as frações foram reuni das e submetidas ao ensaio de toxicidade. As sub-frações biotivas TCSM1-3-2 (0,006 g) e TCSM1-4-4 (0,01 g) foram identificadas como mistura dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos através da análise dos espectros de RMN de 1H e por comparação com os dados da literatura. Para identificação do tamanho das cadeias metilênicas dos ácidos, uma pequena alíquota das amostras foi esterificada com diazometano como descrito por Leonard et al.,13 fornecendo os ésteres metílicos identificados via CG/EM e por comparação com a literatura. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO Inicialmente, os extratos orgânicos das cascas dos frutos (TCCF, pericarpo), cascas das sementes (TCCS, arilo) e sementes (TCS) de T. claussenii foram submetidos a ensaios de toxicidade sobre S. frugi perda. Os resultados iniciais mostraram que o extrato metanólico das sementes de T. claussenii (TCSM) provocou a mais alta porcentagem de mortalidade (64,0%, Figura 1). O extrato TCSM foi então fracionado, fornecendo as frações he xano (TCSM-1), diclorometano (TCSM-2), acetato de etila (TCSM-3) e hidrometanólico (TCSM-4). Entretanto, somente a fração TCSM-1 apresentou atividade relevante com 70,0% de mortalidade sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho (Tabela 1). O fracionamento biomonitorado da fração TCSM-1 levou às sub- frações bioativas TCSM-1-3-2 (59,0% de mortalidade) e TCSM-1-4-4 (73,3% de mortalidade) (Tabela 1). Os espectros de RMN de 1H das frações TCSM-1-4-4 e TCSM- 1-3-2 evidenciaram a presença de ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alque noicos nestas frações através dos sinais observados entre δH 7,15-7,28 (m) indicativos de hidrogênios ligados aos anéis aromáticos; dois tripletos em δH 2,59 e δH 2,24 referente aos hidrogênios das posições benzílicas e α-carbonílicos, respectivamente; sinais em δH 1,20-2,00 (m) característicos de hidrogênios de cadeia metilênica e um sinal em δH 5,34 (t) referente aos hidrogênios ligados às ligações duplas. A ausência de sinais entre δH 3,50 e δH 4,50 indica que não estão Figura 1.

Esses dados para os ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos são equivalentes aos relatados anteriormente.8,14 Para identificação dos constituintes minoritários (ácidos graxos), do tamanho das cadeias metilênicas dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos e localização da posição da ligação dupla dos últimos, uma pequena alíquota das frações TCSM-1-4-4 e TCSM-1-3-2 foi esterifica da com diazometano13 e, posteriormente, analisada via CG-EM. Através da comparação dos espectros de massas com os dados da biblioteca do CG-EM e da literatura,8,14 foi possível propor os tamanhos das cadeias metilênicas desses ácidos que variaram entre 10 a 15 carbonos (Figura 2, Tabela 2). Foi possível propor também a localização da ligação dupla dos ácidos ω-fenil alquenoicos entre os carbonos δ-ε em relação ao grupo fenila. Os ácidos ω-fenil alquenoicos apresentaram como pico base m/z 104, oriundo da fragmentação do tipo McLafferty da ligação dupla (Esquema 1). O cromatograma da fração bioativa TCSM-1-4-4 apresentou 39 picos, cujos espectros de massas foram comparados aos da biblioteca de dados do CG-EM e literatura,8,14 resultando na identificação de 18 ácidos que correspondem a 88,9% da porcentagem relativa dos mesmos na fração, sendo 74,8% ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos e 14,1% ácidos graxos (Tabela 2).

Vanderherchen et al.15 sintetizaram substâncias da classe de ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e demonstraram a atividade dos mesmos em outras espécies de insetos. Ensaios por aplicação tópica foram realizados com os ácidos 7-fenileptanoico e 7-fenilept-4-enoico na dose de 50,0 μg/inseto em lagartas de 4° instar de Manduca sexta (Lepdoptera: Sphingidae), Heliothis virescens (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae) e Helico verpa zea (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae) e foram observados mortalidades na faixa de 55,0 a 70,0%. O modo de ação dos ácidos ω-fenil alca noicos e alquenoicos em lepdópteras ainda é desconhecido. Através do biomonitoramento realizado dos extratos e frações dos frutos de T. claussenii, pôde-se constatar que as substâncias ativas sobre S. frugiperda eram o conjunto dos ácidos ω-fenil alcanoicos e alquenoicos. Esse conjunto de ácidos apresenta-se como uma nova classe química de potenciais agentes inseticidas, assim como os limonoides encontrados em meliáceas.16 AGRADECIMENTOS Ao CNPq, à CAPES e FAPESP pelas bolsas e apoios financeiros concedidos.

Myrsinoic A acid, isolated from Myrsine cuneifolia and its hydrogenated derivative had their effect on photosynthesis tested. The compounds inhibited the electron flow (basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled) from water to methylviologen; therefore, they act as Hill reaction inhibitors in spinach thylakoids. They inhibited partial reactions of PSII electron flow from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, from water to sodium silicomolybdate, and partially electron flow from diphenylcarbazide to 2,6-dichloroindophenol. Their inhibition sites were at the donor and acceptor sides of PSII, between P680 and QA. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements confirmed the behavior of the compounds (pool of quinones).

INTRODUÇÃO O Cerrado é um bioma de destaque mundial devido à alta biodiver sidade e à ocorrência de espécies endêmicas, sendo o segundo maior bioma brasileiro, superado em área apenas pela Amazônia. Dentre as diversas famílias de plantas que compõem o Bioma Cerrado, encontra -se a família Myrsinaceae, que engloba cerca de 33 gêneros, com 1000 indivíduos largamente distribuídos pelas regiões tropicais do planeta.¹,² Vários compostos isolados de espécies do gênero Myrsine, fa mília Myrsinaceae, foram descritos com atividades biológicas, tais como, rapanona, atividade bactericida.³ A citotoxidade de rapanona foi testada, e observou-se a atividade frente a quatro linhagens de células de: adenocarcinoma (HT-29), epitelioma (Hep–2), câncer de mama (MCF-7) e câncer de estômago (MKN-45).4 Através de uma breve revisão bibliográfica, verificou-se que a espécie Myrsine cuneifolia (Myrsinaceae) não possuía dados químicos publicados até o momento. Em função disto, bem como do grande potencial biológico apresentado por metabólitos produzidos pelo gênero e, ainda, pelo fácil acesso à planta, a mesma foi escolhida para estudo. Os produtos naturais têm se mostrado como uma das fontes mais ricas e promissoras de novos compostos com atividade fitotóxica e reguladora do crescimento de plantas.5-9 Contudo, o uso de produtos naturais como herbicidas, ou como modelos para conduzir programas de descoberta de herbicidas, é uma alternativa que não tem sido explo rada tanto quanto foi para inseticidas e fungicidas. Produtos naturais fitotóxicos são, em geral, estruturalmente mais complexos que herbi cidas sintéticos e não são economicamente obtidos por metodologias sintéticas tradicionais. Esta área está sendo explorada lentamente,10 talvez pelo pequeno número de pesquisadores envolvidos na área, pela falta de trabalhos em biotecnologia de produção de herbicidas naturais, ou mesmo, pela falta de ensaios que permitam conhecer o mecanismo de atividade dos compostos de interesse. Nossos estudos sobre a interação de produtos naturais com os sítios da fotossíntese, visando a busca por modelos para herbicidas baseados em substâncias isoladas de plantas e micro-organismos, inicialmente mostraram-se muito interessantes. Os alcaloides flin dersina e N-metil-flindersina se comportam de maneira semelhante ao herbicida comercial DCMU (3-(3,4-diclorofenil)-1,1-dimetilu réia).11 A N-metil-flindersina apresenta ainda um segundo mecanis mo de ação, pois interfere na oxidação da plastoquinona (PQH2). O policetídeo, lasiodiplodina, possui três mecanismos de ação: inibidor da reação de Hill; inibe parcialmente o complexo enzimático que oxida a molécula de água e interage com o complexo proteico CF1 (centro catalítico do ATPase), através da inibição da atividade de CF1 – Mg2+ - ATPase.12 A cumarina, siderina, também inibe a reação de Hill; inibe tanto o lado doador, quanto o lado aceptor de elétrons do FSII (Fotosistema II) entre P680 – QA (Centro reacional do FSII – Quinona A), criando os chamados centros silenciosos de reação, o que pode levar ao desenvolvimento de agentes fitotóxicos contra a fotossíntese de plantas daninhas.13 Dentro desse contexto, o metabólito isolado do extrato dos frutos de Myrsine cuneifolia e seu derivado foram submetidos a uma série de reações enzimáticas que auxiliaram no esclarecimento do (s) mecanismo (s) ação frente à fotossíntese. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO Efeito das substâncias 1 e 2 sobre o transporte de elétrons não cíclico: reação de Hill A formação de ATP pode ser inibida em qualquer uma das etapas da cadeia transportadora de elétrons.14 Dessa forma, para conhecer o efeito dos derivados de ácidos benzoicos sobre a produção de energia, foram investigados seus mecanismos de ação nas três etapas da cadeia de transporte de elétrons. Os resultados mostraram que a evolução de oxigênio em cloroplastos iluminados, tendo metilviologênio (MV) como aceptor de elétrons foi inibida na presença de ADP e fostato Burger et al. 1396 Quim. Nova inorgânico (Pi). Observou-se que a inibição foi completamente rea lizada pela presença de NH4Cl como desacoplante (Figura 1). Os reagentes que bloqueiam o transporte de elétrons também ini bem a síntese de ATP, a partir da formação do gradiente eletroquímico transmembrana. A força de saída para a síntese de ATP é dependente do fluxo de elétrons. Os compostos que aumentam a permeabilidade de prótons nas membranas de tilacoide desacoplam a fosforilação do fluxo de elétrons. Os agentes desacoplantes inibem a síntese de ATP pela diminuição do gradiente de prótons, porém o transporte de elétrons ainda pode ocorrer sob taxas elevadas. Em contraste, os inibidores diretos da fosforilação oxidativa bloqueiam tal fenômeno e, ainda, a porção do transporte de elétrons, que é consequência do fluxo de prótons ligado à fosforilação.15 Assim, a inibição descrita da fosforilação produzida pelas substâncias 1 e 2 pode ser explicada pelo seu efeito em cada uma das etapas da cadeia transportadora, através de reações de transferência de energia. Avaliou-se o efeito dos compostos 1 e 2 sobre as razões de transporte de elétrons em diferentes condições (basal, fosforilante e desacoplado). Na ausência (basal) ou presença (fosforilante) de ADP, Pi, ou NH4Cl (desacoplado) e usando MV como aceptor de elétrons, os compostos 1 e 2 inibiram a velocidade do transporte de elétrons em cloroplastos iluminados (Figuras 2 e 3). Observou-se que todas as condições do fluxo de elétrons foram inibidas pela substância 1, com valores de I50 de 32,0; 57,0 e 77,0 mM para os transportes basal, fosforilante e desacoplado, respectivamente. O composto 2 apresentou comportamento similar, pois apresentou valores de I50 de 25,0; 42,0 e 62,0 mM. A partir desses resultados foi possível concluir que ambos os compostos podem ser classificados como inibidores da reação de Hill. Localização dos ambientes de interação dos derivados de ácidos benzoicos sobre FSII e FSI e suas reações parciais Com o objetivo de determinar os sítios de interação na cadeia de transporte de electrons nos tilacóides, foram analisados os efeitos de 1 e 2 sobre o FSII desacoplado, FSI (Fotosistema I) e suas respec tivas reações parciais, usando-se doadores e aceptores artificais de elétrons, bem como os inibidores apropriados.16 As substâncias 1 e 2 inibiram o fluxo de elétrons do FSII de H2O a DCBQ (2,5-dicloro-1,4 -benzoquinona) (Figura 4), de H2O a SiMo (Figura 4) e, ainda, de DPC (difenilcarbazida) a DCPIP (2,6-diclofenol-indofenol) (Tabela 1). Os ácidos 1 e 2 apresentaram I50 de 113,0 e 138,0 mM, respectivamente, para a reação FSII: H2O – DCBQ. Já para a reação parcial FSII: H2O – SiMo os valores de I50 obtidos foram de 151,0 (1) e 167,0 (2) mM. Verificou-se ainda que 1 e 2 inibiram em 46 e 48%, respectivamente, a 300 mM a reação FSII: DPC – DCPIP (Tabela 1). As medidas polarográficas indicaram que o transporte de elétrons no FSII é afetado na presença dos compostos 1 e 2, prendendo-se ao sítio da ação da quinona A (QA), impedindo a transferência de elétrons entre o centro reacional do FSII (P680) e QA. Pode-se dizer então que as substâncias 1 e 2 afetam o FSII tanto pelo lado doador quanto pelo lado aceptor de elétrons, prendendo-se ao sítio catalítico localizado entre P680 – QA (pool das quinonas). A criação de centros de reação “silenciosos” pode ser um dos mecanismos de ação de 1 e 2 e ainda representa um caminho útil para o desenvolvimento de modelos para herbicidas inibidores da fotossíntese de plantas daninhas. Por outro lado, esses compostos não apresentaram efeito sobre o FSI (dados não apresentados). Medidas dos transientes da fluorescência da Chl a na presença dos compostos 1 e 2 No intuito de colaborar para o esclarecimento do(s) sítio(s) de interação das substâncias 1 e 2 sobre o FSII, cloroplatos frescos e lisos foram incubados por 10 min no escuro, à temperatura ambiente com Figura 1. Estrutura química do ácido myrsinoico A (1) isolado de M. cunei folia e seu derivado (2) Figura 2.

O controle dos tilacoides mostrou uma curva de fluorescência polifásica com uma sequência OJIP de transientes similares àqueles previamente publi cados por Strasser et al..17 A adição de 50 mM do herbicida DCMU induz um rápido aumento do rendimento da fluorescência durante os primeiros 2 ms de iluminação; isto transforma a sequência regular OJIP numa curva OJ.17 Quando os cloroplastos são tratados com tris, verifica-se a redução na indução da fluorescência.18 Isto resulta na redução do rendimento máximo da fluorescência, a banda-K aparece e consiste de um rápido aumento (a 300 ms) seguido por uma redução no rendimento da fluorescência a um nível próximo a F0 (fluorescência inicial onde todos os níveis, J e I estão ausentes do transiente).19,20 As condições dos tilacoides tratados com tris são mostradas também por cloroplastos tratados-aquecidos onde as perdas no OEC (complexo de evolução de oxigênio) ocorrem. A análise da diferença de cada curva do controle da fluorescência relativa variável, quando a fase O – J foi normalizada entre Fj – F0, Wt = Fv,t/(Fj – F0)/(Fj – F0), mostra um aumento na supressão do nível J (a 2 ms) e um rápido aumento a aproximadamente 300 ms aparece na presença de 1 e 2, indicando claramente a criação de uma banda K (Figura 6). O aparecimento da banda K surge a partir de um desequilíbrio no fluxo de elétrons entre os doadores e aceptores de elétrons do sítio do FSII. Nesta condição, o fluxo de elétrons do OEC a Z (resíduo de tirosina) é mais lento que o fluxo de elétrons do P680 a QA. O rápido aumento da fluorescência inicial é devido à redução de QA a QA - seguida pela redução de P680+ por Z sem a participação direta do complexo OEC.19 A análise do transiente da fluorescência (Chl a) claramente indica que o fluxo de elétrons no OEC foi inibido pelos compostos. Quando o OEC é inibido, não há doação de elétrons a Yz, que por sua vez não reduz P680 +; dentro deste contexto, ocorre uma máxima acumulação de P680 +, Pheo+ e QA -. Strasset et al.21 propuseram o termo “centro de reação silencioso” como os centros que não podem nem reduzir QA e nem voltar a transferir sua energia de excitação às moléculas antena (clorofilas); portanto, as unidades correspondentes ao FSII não con tribuem para a fluorescência variável e seus rendimentos de fluores cência são menores.20 Os valores de F0 foram quase constantes e de FM diminuíram na presença de 1 e 2, e os valores mais baixos da área sobre a curva entre F0 e FM (Tabela 2) indicam que a transferência de elétrons ao sítio da quinona é bloqueada. Assim, a quinona A (QA) do FSII não é reduzida, e estes resultados sugerem a criação dos centros de reação silenciosos,20 devido à interferência das substâncias 1 e 2.

Material vegetal Os frutos de Myrsine cuneifolia foram coletados no mês de setembro de 2008, em Anápolis-Goiás, no Campus da Universidade Estadual de Goiás, e identificados pela Profa Dra M. L. dos Santos. A exsicata, n°. 4215, do material vegetal foi depositada no herbário do departamento de Ciências Biológicas da Universidade Estadual de Goiás. Extração e isolamento dos constituintes Os frutos secos de M. cuneifolia (400 g) foram macerados e extraídos exaustivamente em etanol a frio. O solvente foi evaporado à pressão reduzida em evaporador rotatório (45 ºC), o que permitiu a obtenção de 62 g do extrato bruto etanólico (MCFrE). Esse extrato foi fracionado por cromatografia em coluna (φ = 3,0 cm x h = 20,0 cm), utilizando-se como fase estacionária celulose microcristalina D e eluentes em ordem crescente de polaridade: hexano, diclorometano, acetato de etila e metanol, obtendo-se as frações: hexânica (MCFrEH – 10 g), diclorometânica (MCFrED – 4 g), acetato de etila (MCFrEA – 5 g) e metanólica (MCFrEW – 30 g). A fração MCFrEH (1 g) foi fracionada por cromatografia em coluna utilizando como fase estacionária sílica flash (230-400 Mesh) e como fase móvel diclorometano-acetato de etila 5% (φ = 3,0 cm x h = 19,0 cm), o que gerou 22 frações.

Hidrogenação catalítica de 1 Solubilizou-se 0,02 g da substância (1) em 4 mL de metanol, seguida da adição de 0,01 mg de paládio adsorvido em carvão (Pd/C). O sistema permaneceu sob atmosfera de gás hidrogênio durante 12 h, sob agitação constante; após este tempo filtrou-se sob celite, o que permitiu a obtenção do derivado (2) (0,017 g).

Avaliação do potencial herbicida: inibição da reação de Hill As folhas de espinafre foram obtidas nos supermercados da ci dade de São Carlos – SP, em seguida lavadas e secas, para posterior seleção das folhas com maior grau de uniformidade. Para extração dos cloroplastos de espinafre (S. oleracea L.), as folhas já livres da nervura central e das extremidades basal e apical (25 g) foram trituradas em liquidificador e submetidas à extração com 100 mL do seguinte meio: sacarose (400 mmol L-1), MgCl2 (5mmol L-1), KCl (10mmolL-1) e K+-tricina (30mmolL-1) em pH 8,0 (1molL-1 KOH). O meio foi homogeneizado e filtrado com o auxílio de um funil e camadas de gaze. O filtrado foi centrifugado (4000 rpm, 4 oC e 5 min) e o sobrenadante, eliminado. O precipitado contendo os cloroplastos foi dissolvido em 1 mL do mesmo meio usado no isolamento.22 Para determinar a concentração de clorofila, duas alíquotas de 20 mL da suspensão de cloroplastos foram transferidas para dois tubos de centrífuga contendo 5 mL de acetona (80%), cada. A amostra permaneceu no escuro por 5 min e, depois, foi submetida à centri fugação (4000 rpm e 5 min). Em seguida, foram feitas medidas de absorbâncias do sobrenadante nos comprimentos de onda de 645 e 663 nm, de acordo com a Equação 1.23 Clorofila (mgmL-1) = 20,2 (A645) + 8,02 (A663) (1) Para os ensaios foram utilizadas soluções dos compostos puros, caracterizados e identificados. As soluções das amostras foram prepa radas em concentrações variadas, usando solução DMSO (0,5%) como solvente. O fluxo de elétrons fotossintético foi determinado pela captura de oxigênio, utilizando-se um microeletrodo de Clark conectado ao medidor de oxigênio dissolvido, YSI 5300A. Para avaliar a ação das amostras na inibição da reação de Hill, estas foram adicionadas ao meio reacional em concentrações que variaram de 1 a 500 µmol L-1 e as medidas foram comparadas com o controle.24 Para o transporte de elétrons basal, utilizou-se o seguinte meio reacional: clorofila (20µg mL-1), sacarose (100 mmol L-1), MgCl2.6H2O (5mmolL-1), KCl (10mmolL-1) e K3[Fe(CN)6] (K+-tricina), 15 mmol L-1, pH 8 (1mmol L-1 KOH). A reação teve início com iluminação saturante de 350 W (lâmpada comum) durante 3 min, sob condições aeróbicas.25 Utilizou-se 100 mM de MV [dicloreto de 1,1’-dimetil-4,4’-bipiridínio (dicloreto de paraquat)] como aceptor de elétrons. O transporte de elétrons fosforilante foi determinado, assim como o transporte de elétrons basal, adicionando-se à mistura uma solução 1 mmol L-1 de ADP e 3mmolL-1 K2HPO4, KCN (0,1 mmol L-1) para inibir a ativi dade catalítica. O transporte de elétrons desacoplado foi determinado da mesma forma que o transporte de elétrons basal, adicionando-se à mistura uma solução 5mmol L-1 de NH4Cl. As reações parciais na cadeia de transporte de elétrons foram medidas utilizando-se inibido res específicos, como DCMU 10µmolL-1; 2,5-dibromo-3-metil-6 -isopropil-1,4-p-benzoquinona (DBMIB) 1 µmol L-1; e os seguintes doadores e aceptores de elétrons: silicomolibdato de sódio (SiMo Na+) 100µmolL-1; difenilcarbazida (DPC) 200 µmol L-1; diaminodureno (DAD), 100 µmol L-1 e metilviologênio (MV) 100 µmol L-1. Determinação do fluxo de elétrons nos fotossistemas II e I (FSII e FSI) desacoplados e suas reações parciais O fluxo de elétrons nos FSII e FSI foi medido, assim como no Tabela 2. Efeito do DCMU, das substâncias 1 e 2 sobre os parâmetros da fluorescência de tilacoides previamente incubados por 10 min no escuro, e com tris 0,8 M, pH 8,0 Substância F0 FM FV/FM Área Controle 304 1412 0,785 48821 DCMU (50 mM) 305 1188 0,743 2421 Tris (0,8 M) 299 537 0,443 0 1 (200 mM) 308 1244 0,752 65648 2 (200 mM) 297 1158 0,744 58925 Ácido myrsinoico A e derivado: inibidores da fotossíntese in vitro 1399 Vol. 35, No. 7 ensaio para o transporte de elétrons desacoplado. O FSII inicialmente foi medido de H2O a DCPIPreduzido, ou H2O a DCBQ, suportados pela evolução de O2. O meio reacional foi constituído por 1 mM DBMIB, 100 mM DCPIP, 500 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] e 6 mM NH4Cl.25 Em seguida, a substância foi submetida ao transporte de elétrons do FSII (H2O a SiMo), que foi determinado assim como para FSII, com exceção de 1 mM DBMIB, 100 mM DCPIP, 500 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], que foram omitidos e 200 mM SiMo e 10 mM DCMU, que foram adicionados.26 O transporte de elétrons do FSII (DPC a DCPIPoxidado) foi medi do através da redução da razão de DCPIPox com espectrofotômetro e determinado em tilacoides previamente tratados com Tris 0,8 M (pH 8,0) e incubados por 30 min a 4 oC.27 Quando um composto inibe as reações do fotossistema II, o sítio de inibição é comprovado utilizando-se a técnica de fluorescência transiente da clorofila a do FSII. A razão de transporte de elétrons do FSI foi determinada atra vés do consumo de O2 de uma maneira similar à razão do transporte de elétrons basal não cíclico com 10 mM DCMU, 100 mM DCPIP reduzido com 300 mM ácido ascórbico, 50 mM MV e 6 mM NH4Cl, que foram utilizados como meio reacional.28 Estudos da fluorescência da clorofila a (Chl a) As curvas de indução da Chl a foram medidas à temperatura ambiente com um Hansatech Handy PEA (Plant Effiecient Analyzer) como descrito por Strasser et al..17 O rendimento máximo da fluores cência das amostras foi gerado usando três diodos que emitem luz (650 nm). A duração do pulso foi de 1 s. O meio de reação utilizado foi o mesmo que para as medidas do transporte de elétrons basal. Para monitorar os transientes da fluorescência da Chl a, alíquotas de tilacoides adaptados ao escuro contendo 20 mg de Chl foram transfe ridas a um papel de filtro (1,0 x 1,0 cm). Em seguida, o material foi adicionado em 3 mL do meio e ainda em diferentes concentrações dos compostos testados. As amostras foram mantidas no escuro por 10 min e, em seguida, foram realizadas as leituras dos parâmetros. Os resultados representam a média de cinco repetições, obtidas di retamente através do software PEA Plus Versão 1.02. Os diferentes parâmetros técnicos da fluorescência do FSII foram obtidos com a equação do teste OJIP, usando o programa Bioanalyser.29 A área entre a curva de fluorescência máxima (FM) e inicial (F0) foi alterada pela presença de compostos que interagem com o FSII.17,20 A energia medida precisa bloquear todos os centros de reação do FSII, que foi medida pela razão Área/(Fm – Fo). VJ, fluorescência da eficiência quântica variável relativa a 2 ms (fase J). A medida de VJ = (F2ms - Fo)/(FM – F0). VJ é usada como indicador da eficiência fotoquímica primária do FSII. VI representa a fluorescência variável relativa a 30 ms. A medida de VI = (F30ms – F0)/(FM – F0); Sm, é a área normalizada.29 A densidade dos centros de reação, RC/Cso, fornece o número ativo proporcional aos centros reacionais (RCs) para a seção cruzada da amostra medida, RC/CSo = PHI(P0)(VJ/M0)F0; índice de desem penho, PI(abs) = (RC/ABS)[PHI(P0)/(1 – PHI(P0)] [PSI0/(1 – PSI0)]. PSI0 expressa a probabilidade de excitação aprisionada pela entrada no centro de reação do FSII da cadeia do transporte de elétrons, PSIo = Area/(FM – F0)VJ. O número de turnover de QA indica quantas vezes QA é reduzida no tempo t0 a tFmax e é medida por N = Sm.Mo(1/VJ); Sm é a área complementar total normalizada, que corresponde à fase O – J. M0 fornece a inclinação da curva de normalização desde a origem até o aumento da fluorescência, bem como a medida da taxa fotoquímica primária.30 Calcula-se M0 = 4(F300 – F0)/(FM – F0) por 1 ms. PHI(Po) ou TRo/ABS (eficiência quântica ou relações de fluxo) representam a probabilidade de captura de elétrons ou ren dimento da eficiência quântica, expressa a probabilidade de um fóton ser absorvido e preso pelo centro da reação PSII. Calcula-se PHI(Po)=(Fm(Área)/(FM – Fo)Fo)/Fm. A constante de excitação fotoquímica (kP) é dada por kP = (ABS/CS)kF[(1/Fo)Area/(Fm - Fo) (1/Fm)]. Tem-se ainda kN, constante de excitação não fotoquímica; KH (constante por dissipação de calor) e KF (emissão por fluorescência). Calcula-se kN = (ABS/CS) kF (1/Fm). ABS/RC fornece o tamanho efetivo da antena do centro de reação ativo (RC). Este parâmetro expressa o número total de fótons absorvidos pela molécula de clo rofila em todos os centros reacionais, ABS/RC = M0(1/VJ)(1/PHI(P0). CONCLUSÕES A partir dos frutos de Myrsine cuneifolia foi isolado o composto 1 (ácido myrsinoico A). Esse metabólito sofreu reação de hidrogenação catalítica, para a obtenção de um derivado. Neste trabalho, relata-se pela primeira vez o efeito desses compostos sobre a fotossíntese in vitro em cloroplastos de espinafre, através de uma série de reações enzimáticas, utilizadas para o esclarecimento de seus mecanismos de ação. Os resultados sugeriram que os compostos possuem mais de um mecanismo de ação. Os compostos que inibem o transporte de elétrons em todas as suas etapas (basal, fosforilante e desacoplado) atuam como inibidores da reação de Hill, através do bloqueio e/ou redução do transporte de elétrons pelo lado aceptor de elétrons (neste caso, o MV). Na literatura são encontrados outros produtos naturais que se comportam de maneira similar: ácido trachiloban-19-oico,31 xantorri zol,25 tricolorin A,24 N-metil-flindersina,11 6-(3,3-dimetilaliloxi)-4-me toxi-5-metilfitalideo,32 butil 7b-hidroxi-6-oxovouacapan-17b‑oate,33 canofilol34 e 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexa-O-acetildulcitol.35 Dados obtidos após medidas polarográficas permitiram localizar o sítio de ação dos compostos sobre o FS II. Ambos possuem sítio de interação tanto pelo lado doador, quanto pelo aceptor de elétrons, prendendo-se ao pool das quinonas (P680 – QA). Um terceiro mecanismo de ação foi descoberto através de estudos de fluorescência da clorofila a (ChL a), que indicaram que os metabólitos inibem parcialmente o complexo enzimático que provoca a fotólise da molécula de água, ou seja, ocorre a formação de centros de “reação silenciosos”, o que não permite a redução do aceptor primário de elétrons do FS II (QA), impedindo a transferência de elétrons. Devido à quantidade razoável obtida de ácido myrsinoico 1 (0,4 g), posteriormente esse composto passará por novas modificações estruturais, no intuito de se obter derivados mais ativos e com maior potencial fitotóxico.

ABSTRACT: Chromatographic fractionation of the organic extract from leaves of Ouratea multiﬂ ora afforded the ﬂ avone dimers heveaﬂ avone, amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl eter, podocarpusﬂ avone-A and amentoﬂ avone. Their structures were elucidated from spectral data, including 2D-NMR experiments of the natural substances. Biological activities of all isolates were evaluated, using antimicrobial assay against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, cytotoxicity assay against mouse lymphoma (L5178) and KB cell lines, TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidant activity measured by DPPH test. Keywords: Ochnaceae, Ouratea multiﬂ ora, biﬂ avonoids, antibacterial activity. INTRODUCTION Species of the Ochnaceae family are distributed in tropical and subtropical zones throughout the World (Hegnauer, 1969; Carvalho et al., 2000) This family is characterized by the presence of ﬂ avonoids and biﬂ avonoids and terpenoids as main secondary metabolites (Oliveira et al., 2002; Estevam et al 2005). Several members of the Ouratea genus are employed for the extraction of edible oil, and are used as medicinal plants (Moreira et al., 1994; Agra et al., 2007). As part of our research program on the bioactive constituents of Atlantic Forest plant species, we have investigated Ouratea multiﬂ ora collected in Juréia Reserve, São Paulo State. As result, four ﬂ avonoid dimers: heveaﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986) amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl-ether (Geiger, 1986), podocarpusﬂ avone-A (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987) and amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987; Felício et al., 2001), were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the leaves. Additionally, the biological activity of the isolates was also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS General procedure 1H and 13C NMR, inverse heteronuclear HMQC and HMBC as well as COSY experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument operating at 500 MHz for hydrogen, and 125 MHz for carbon, respectively. Pyridine-d5 or DMSO-d6 were used as solvents and TMS as internal standard. TLC was performed on precoated aluminum sheets (silica F254, 0.25 mm, Merck, Parmtadt, Germany) with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and by spraying with anisaldeyde reagent followed by heating (120 °C). Silica gel (230-400 mesh ASTM, particle size 0.040- 0.063 µM, Merck) or Sephaex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used in the CC fractionations. Plant material Ouratea multiﬂ ora was collected at the Botanical reserve of Juréia, São Paulo, Brazil and a 320 Carlos Alberto Carbonezi, Lidilhone Hamerski, A. A. Leslie Gunatilaka, et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 voucher was placed at the Botanical Institute, São Paulo State, Brazil. Extraction and isolation Dried powdered leaves of Ouratea multiﬂ ora (118.0 g) were extracted by maceration using ethanol at room temperature. The extract was ﬁ ltered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude extract (3.44 g) was dissolved in n-BuOH. Subsequent addition of water afforded two phases which were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The n-BuOH fraction (2.10 g) was solubilized with methanol/water (8:2 v/v) and partitioned with n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate, successively. The ethyl acetate phase after concentration of the solvent (980.0 mg), was chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column with a gradient elution of MeOH/H2O. The separation was monitored by TLC, and eluted fractions exhibiting similar appearances were combined, yielding 20 fractions. Fractions 7 and 8 showed a solid precipitation. The solid was washed with cold methanol to afford heveaﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986) (1) (21.2 mg). Fraction 13 was chromatographed on silica gel yielding amentoﬂ avone 7”, 4”’-dimethyl ether (2) (10.8 mg). Fraction 15 gave a powder after precipitation. This powder was washed with cold methanol to afford podocarpusﬂ avone-A 3 (Markam et al., 1987) (8.9 mg). Fraction 17 was chromatographed on silica gel using CHCl3:MeOH (4:6) yielding amentoﬂ avone 4 (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987) (15.0 mg). Antimicrobial assay Sterile ﬁ lter paper disks were impregnated with 20 mg of samples using DMSO as carrier solvent. The impregnated disks were then placed on agar plates previously inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 2592) and Bacillus subtilis (DSM 2105). Solvent controls were incubated at 37 oC for each organism, and after incubate time of 24 h at 37 oC, antimicrobial activity was recorded as clear zones (in mm) of inhibition surrounding the disk. The sample was considered active when the inhibition surrounding the disk was greater than 7 mm. Cytotoxicity assay Antiproliferative activity was examined against two cell lines and was determined through an MTT assay as described earlier (Edrada et al., 1996).

Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The chromatographic fractionation of the ethanol extract from the leaves of O. multiﬂ ora afforded heveaﬂ avone (1), amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl-ether (2), podocarpusﬂ avone-A (3), and amentoﬂ avone (4). The 13C NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed 31 signals, which were attributed to twelve sp2 CH, including signals at δCH 114.1 and 127.6, each representing two carbon atoms, three sp3 carbons (δCH3 55.1, 55.5 and 55.9), sixteen sp2 quaternary carbons and two carbonyl groups (δC 181.6 and 182.2) (Table 2).

A. Leslie Gunatilaka, et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals for two chelated hydroxyls at δH 13.19 and 12.93 (OH-5 and OH-5”), three aromatic methoxyl groups, a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring (B ring) and a 1,4-disubstituted (B’ ring). The 1H NMR spectra [1D and 2D (1H-1H-COSY)] showed a para-substituted aromatic ring at δH 7.55 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’), δH 6.82 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’), two meta aromatic hydrogens at δH 6.23 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-6), 6.49 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8), commonly observed in a ﬂ avone nucleous. The structure of 1 was established on the basisi of HMBC spectra, which showed heteronuclear long- range couplings of quaternary carbons C-7’’ (δC 161.2), C-7 (δC 164.8) and C-4”’ (δC 162.4) with the hydrogens of methoxyl groups at δH 3.72 (OMe-7’’), 3.77 (OMe-7), and 3.81 (OMe-4”’), respectively, and by comparison of their spectral data with those reported for heveaﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986). Compound 2 also showed spectral features of a ﬂ avonoid dimer derivative (Table 2). The 1H MNR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 showed the presence of to chelated hydroxyl and at δH 3.83 and δH 3.75 two methoxyl groups. The 1H-1H-COSY spectrum of compound 2 showed a set of doublets at δH 7.66 (d, J 9.5 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’) and δH 6.91 (d, J 9.5 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) of an AA’BB’ system, besides the signals at δH 7.98 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.14 (d, J 8.5, H-5’) and 8.01 (dd, J 8.5; 2.5, H-6’) attributed to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring. Furthermore, the 1H-1H-COSY spectrum showed signals with a meta coupling pattern at δH 6.17 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-6) and 6.45 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8) corresponding to an A ring of a ﬂ avone. The HMBC spectrum of 2 revealed correlations of the hydrogen-bonded OH-5 (δH 12.94) with C-5 (δC 161.4), C-6 (δC 98.8) and C-10 (δC 103.7), while OH-5” (δH 13.20) correlated with C-5” (δC 161.4), C-6” (δC 95.6) and C-10” (δC 104.2). From the long range coupling of H-6 (δH 6.17) and H-3 (δH 6.82) with C-10 (δC 103.7); H-3”’ and H-5”’ (δH 6.91) with C- 1”’ (δC 122.9); and H-3” (δH 6.92) with C-10” (δC 104.2) thus, the structure of 2 was established to be a dimer. A literature search conﬁ rmed the structure of 2 as 7”,4”’- dimethoxy-amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986). 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 showed signals at δH 13.05, δC 182.2, δH 12.95, and δC 181.8 of two hydrogen of chelated hydroxyl groups, and an O-methyl group at δH 3.74 (δC 55.5). A detailed analysis of cross peaks from the 1H-1H COSY spectrum showed two doublets for a mono-oxygenated para disubstituted system at δH 7.65 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’) and 6.91 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’), one trioxygenated tetra substituted ring with alternating oxy-substituents at δH 6.17 (d, J 1.5 Hz, H-6) and δH 6.45 (d, J 1.5 Hz, H-8), and one mono-oxygenated trisubstituted system at δH 7.98 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.15 (d, J 8.5 Hz, H-5’) and 8.00 (dd, J 8.5; 2.5 Hz, H-6’). Additional 1D and 2D NMR data indicated a pentasubstituted aromatic ring with a 5,7- dioxygenation pattern for the A’ ring of a ﬂ avone (δH 6.41, H-6”) and two singlets (δH 6.81 (H-3), δH 6.86 (H-3’’) of both ﬂ avones units in compound 3. Analysis of HMBC spectra revealed characteristic correlations which deﬁ ned the positions of aromatic rings and their substitution patterns. Correlations of H-3 (δ 6.81) with C-2 (δ 163.8), C-4 (δ 181.7), C-10 (δ 103.7), C-1’ (δ 121.1) and H-3” (δ 6.86) with C-2” (δ 163.2), C-4” (δ 182.2), C-10” (δ 103.7), C-1”’ (δ 123.0) established the linkages between rings C/B and C”/B”, respectively. Moreover, the correlation between H-2’ (δ 7.98) and C- 8” (δ 104.0) showed the linkage between C-3’and C-8”. The ROESY correlation observed between methoxyl group at δH 3.74 and the aromatic protons at δH 6.91 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) justify the location of the methoxyl group at C-4”’ of the B’ aromatic ring. These data are in agreement with those published for podocarpusﬂ avone- A (Geiger, 1986; Markham, et al., 1987). 1H NMR spectrum of 4 showed two signals at δH 13.09 and 12.96 due to chelated phenolic hydroxyls, and two doublets at δH 7.56 (J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’), and 6.70 (J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) assigned to an AA’BB’ aromatic system. Signals of a trisubstituted aromatic ring containing one oxygenated carbon were observed at δH 8.00 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.14 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-5’), and 7.99 (dd, J 9.0; 2.5 Hz H-6’), along with doublets of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring containing three oxygenated carbons at δH 6.18 (J 2.5 Hz, H-6) and 6.45 (J 2.5 Hz, H-8). Analysis of the HMBC spectra evidenced correlations of the hydroxyl group with hydrogen bonded by cross peak at δH 13.09 (OH-5) with C-5” (δ 161.1), C-6” (δ 98.7), and C-10” (δ 103.6) and δH 12.96 (OH-5”) with C-5 (δ 162.1), C-6 (δ 98.9) and C-10 (δ 103.7), which are in agreement to those of amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987). Previous studies on 13C NMR data for amenthoﬂ avone derivative dimers indicated a close relationship between substituent effects and chemical shift for the inter-ﬂ avonoid linkage: a) amenthoﬂ avones; I-3’ (+ 6 ppm), II-8’’ (+ 10 ppm), b) dihydroamenthoﬂ avone; I-3’(+ 4 ppm), II-8” (+ 9 ppm), which can be diagnostic values in the recognition of new biﬂ avones in the amenthoﬂ avone series (Markhan, et al., 1987; Felício, et al., 2001). The values of 13C NMR spectra of 1-4 (Table 2) followed logically the average found to the series reported and indicated that O-methylation induced shifts that are in the same direction as those reported for monoﬂ avonoids (Markham, 1978). The biﬂ avonoids were assayed for cytotoxicity toward mouse lymphoma (L5178) and melanoma cancer cell line (KB) (Edrada et al., 1996). None of the compounds were active toward the cell line, however, they showed weak activity against the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and B. subitilis at the concentrations of 0.5 and 10 µg/mL (Table 3). The reference antibiotic, streptomycin sulfate, inhibited the growth of all bacterial species tested in this study at 5 µg/mL (zone inhibition = 30-35 mm). Compounds 1-4 also were submitted to preliminary TLC screening for selecting potential 323 Bioactive ﬂ avone dimers from Ouratea multiﬂ ora (Ochnaceae) Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J.

ABSTRACT: Since the methanol extract of Lantana lilacina leaves collected in the city of Lavras (MG, Brazil) showed antibacterial properties in a preliminary study, a fractionation process guided by agar diffusion assays with Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was carried out to purify and identify the active compounds. After solvent partition and several chromatographic steps, [β-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-(3’-O-α-L- rhamnopyranosyl)-(4’-O-cafeoyl)-β-D-glycopyranoside, known as acteoside, was isolated. The minimal inhibition concentration and the minimal bactericidal concentration of such substance against A. hydrophila, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were 0.12, 1.00, 1.00 and 0.25 mg/ mL, respectively. Keywords: Lantana lilacina, Verbenaceae, antibacterial activity, acteoside. INTRODUCTION Although pharmaceutical industries have produced a large number of new antimicrobial agents, the emergence of resistant bacterial strains has become a public health problem all over the world. In the United States of America, for instance, each year, 70% of the two million cases of bacterial infections acquired in hospitals consist of strains resistant to at least one antibacterial compound (Alexandria, 2004). Moreover, adverse effects and the high cost of the antimicrobial substances make the search for new effective drugs extremely necessary. As the biological activity of plants has been known since antiquity (Rios and Recio, 2005), a preliminary evaluation of local plant extracts was carried out to identify those with antimicrobial properties (Oliveira et al., 2007). During such study, a pronounced in vitro antibacterial property was observed for the aerial parts of Lantana lilacina Desf. (Verbenaceae), a 50-120 cm height native Brazilian shrub, which produces pink or purple ﬂ owers. Known as a weed and an ornamental plant (Lorenzi, 2000), it has been used in the traditional medicine to treat cold and bronchitis (Balbach, 1986). Although several substances have been identiﬁ ed in other species of the Lantana genus (Begum et al., 2000; Siddiqui et al., 1995; Barbosa-Filho et al., 2006), only monoterpene glucoside esters were isolated from L. lilacina leaves (Dembitsky, 2004). No further studies concerning the chemical composition of this plant species have been found. Therefore, this research was aimed to purify and identify the antibacterial compounds present in the methanol extract of L. lilacina leaves. MATERIAL AND METHODS 205 Puriﬁ cation of an antibacterial compound from Lantana lilacina Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 18(2): Abr./Jun. 2008 Plant material Leaves from Lantana lilacina Desf. (Verbenaceae) were collected in the city of Lavras, State of Minas Gerais (Brazil). Voucher specimens were identiﬁ ed by Prof. Valéria E. G. Rodrigues and deposited in the Herbarium ESAL (ESAL 15.172), at Universidade Federal de Lavras, Lavras. General experimental procedures All reagents used were of recognized analytical grade. Acetic acid, acetonitrile, and methanol were HPLC-grade (Vetec, Brazil). During the puriﬁ cation steps, solvent concentration was carried out in a rotatory evaporator at 35 ºC, followed by 24 h in a freeze-drier. Except when mentioned otherwise, all fractions were submitted to antibacterial diffusion assays to direct puriﬁ cation. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Merck). Mass spectra were obtained on an Agilent 1100 LC/MS Trap equipped with an electrospray interface. Samples (1.0 mg) were dissolved in MeOH (1.0 mL) and 20 μL were directly injected into the interface at a ﬂ ow rate of 5 μL/ min. Deuterated dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO-d6) and deuterated methanol (CD3OD) were used as solvents for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses performed on a Varian Unit 500 instrument using solvent peak as reference. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in both solvents, while HMBC, HMQC and TOCSY analyses were carried out only in DMSO-d6. Extraction and isolation Fresh leaves of L. lilacina were exhaustively extracted with methanol at room temperature. Part of the crude extract (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of an ethanol:H2O (7:3; v/v) solution and submitted to the antibacterial diffusion assay. Another part (0.5 mg) of such extract was dissolved in 0.5 mL of an aqueous 1% (g/mL) Tween 80 solution and used in the broth microdilution assay. The crude extract (10.0 g) was subsequently washed with hexane (10 x 100 mL), ethyl acetate (AcOEt; 10 x 100 mL) and methanol (MeOH; 10 x 100 mL). Part (3.5 g) of the MeOH fraction (M1) was successively eluted with MeOH, H2O and HCl 0.1 M through a silica gel column (4 x 15 cm). Part (1.8 g) of the resulting MeOH fraction (M2) was eluted with MeOH through a C-18 column (1 x 5 cm), yielding fraction M3 (1.0 g). Then, M3 was fractionated on a C-18 column (Luna C-18, 200 x 21.2 mm, 10 μM, Phenomenex, USA), using aqueous 0.1% acetic acid solution:MeOH (5% MeOH during 5 min, 5-100% MeOH during 60 min, 100% MeOH for 21 min), at a ﬂ ow rate of 30 mL/min, as eluent. An UV detector set at 254 nm was employed to monitor the fractionation. One of the resulting fractions (F11; 169 mg; eluted between 18-19 min) was puriﬁ ed on the same column employing aqueous 0.1% acetic acid solution:MeOH (62:38) as eluent, at a ﬂ ow rate of 20 mL/ min. In this case the UV detector was set at 320 nm. This procedure yielded fraction 6 as a pure compound (F6; 15 mg; eluted between 10.2-12.5 min), which was identiﬁ ed as acteoside (Figure 1) by NMR and mass spectrometry analyses. Antibacterial assays Antibacterial activity was evaluated with four standard bacterial strains acquired from the American Type of Culture Collection (ATCC, USA): Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (Gram-positive), Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (Gram- negative). Agar diffusion assays (NCCLS, 2003a) were carried out in duplicates. Brieﬂ y, after bacterial growth in triptic soy agar (TSA, Acumedia, USA) during 24 h at 37 ºC, the resulting cultures were used to prepare cell suspensions in an aqueous 0.85% (g/mL) NaCl solution, at 0.5 turbidity according to MacFarland scale. Such suspensions were inoculated with a swab on the surface of Mueller-Hinton agar (Merck, Germany) Petri dishes and 40 μL of each sample were deposited into 6 mm diameter holes made on the inoculated medium. After 24 h at 37 ºC, samples causing 7 mm or larger inhibition zone diameters around the holes were considered active. Minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were determined by a broth microdilution assay (NCCLS, 2003b). A twofold serial dilution of the reference (chloramphenicol succinate: Sigma, USA; 400 μg/mL) and samples were prepared using Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB: Biolife, Italy) supplemented with calcium and magnesium cations (Alderman and Smith, 2001). The crude extract was dissolved in an aqueous 1% (g/mL) Tween 80 solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL and ﬁ ltered through a 0.22 μm membrane (GV Durapore PVDF, Milipore, USA). 7.5 x 104 CFU were poured into each well and the initial extract concentration was 5.0 mg/mL. Aqueous 1% Tween 80 and chloramphenicol solutions were employed as negative and positive control, respectively. After 24 h at 37 oC, 10 μL were withdrawn from each well with no bacterial growth and subcultured in TSA during 24 h at the same temperature. MIC was considered the lowest concentration of the extract that prevented visible growth in the well during 24 h and MBC was deﬁ ned as the lowest concentration yielding negative subcultures during 24 h. The isolated compound (acteoside, Figure 1) was also submitted to a broth microdilution assay. It (2 mg) was dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO (P.A.) and diluted with MHB. The highest acteoside’s concentration in the well was 1.0 mg/mL. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 206 Aline C. Pereira, Hudson W. P. Carvalho, Geraldo H. Silva, et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J.

During all puriﬁ cation steps, only one active fraction was observed. Consequently, it seems that the antibacterial property of the crude extract was due only to the isolated substance, which amounted to 15 mg of a hygroscopic viscous oil that could get dark easily when exposed to light and air. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2), obtained in DMSO-d6, it was clear that most signals belonged to groups linked to heteroatoms (2.7-5.0 ppm) or unsaturated carbons (6.2-7.5 ppm). Such result suggested aromatic rings linked to carbohydrate units. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) pointed to the same direction, since most signals were in the carbon sp3-heteroatom and carbon sp2 regions. Signals at 140 and 150 ppm suggested carbon sp2 - heteroatom groups, while the one at 165 ppm seemed due to a carbonyl group, probably an ester (Silverstein and Webster, 1998; Pretsch et al., 1989).

It is worth to mention that the stereochemistry of the caffeoyl moiety was clear in the 1H spectrum, since the coupling constant (J) between H7 and H8 was 16 Hz, which is characteristic of a trans arrangement (Silverstein and Webster, 1998) Although the spectra obtained in DMSO-d6 were in accordance with NMR data reported for the acteoside dissolved in the same solvent (Tanaka et al., 2004), CD3OD was also used, since it could afford a simpler 1H NMR spectrum. As a consequence, the α-L-rhamnose moiety with OR (linked to C1’’’) and OH (linked to C2’’’) in the axial positions was conﬁ rmed by the low J between H1’’’ and H2’’’ (J = 1.5 Hz, equatorial-equatorial). In the β-D-glucose unit, the trans-diaxial couplings (6.0 - 9.3 Hz) became clear for all hydrogen atoms linked to the ring. Moreover, NMR spectra obtained in CD3OD were totally in agreement with the ﬁ ndings of Wu et al. (2004) and Owen et al. (2003) for the acteoside. The mass spectrometry analysis of the isolated compound in the negative mode showed peaks at m/z 623 [M-H]− and 659 [M+Cl]−. Experiments inducing m/z 623 to fragmentation resulted in m/z 461 [M-H-162]− (MS2) and m/z 315 [M-H-162-146]− (MS3), corresponding to caffeoyl and rhamnose units loss, respectively. In the positive mode, as observed by Plaza et al. (2005), peaks were detected at m/z 647 [M+Na]+ and 501 [M+Na-146]+ (MS2), which was due to the rhamnose unit loss. Once there was no doubt that the isolated compound was the acteoside, a microdilution assay was carried out to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. Speciﬁ cally with A. hydrophila and S. aureus, MIC and MBC values were very close to those obtained with chloramphenicol (Table 3). These results are in agreement with those reported by Didry et al (1999), who observed Proteus mirabilis and S. aureus growth inhibition by the acteoside at 0.128 mg/mL, during an agar dilution assay. Similarly, Lima et al. (2003) observed that a mixture of acteoside and isoacteoside showed MIC of 0.6 mg/mL against S. aureus and B. subtilis. According to Avila et al. (1999), acteoside inhibits S. aureus leucine admission, which stops protein synthesis and kills such bacterium. Unfortunately, P. aeruginosa, a bacterium resistant to several drugs (Barros, 2001), was able to grow in the presence of L. lilacina crude extract. Moreover, acteoside’s MIC and MBC against this microorganism were both 1 mg/mL, which is a high value when compared to other substances (Ng et al., 1996; Ogundipe et al., 2001; Lima et al., 2003). It is worth to mention that other biological activities have also been attributed to acteoside: protein kinase C inhibitor (Herbert et al.,1991); antitumor and immunosuppressive (Zhang et al., 2002; Ohno et al., 2002); antioxidant (Ono et al., 2005; Owen et al., 2003; Aligiannia et al., 2003); and antiinﬂ ammatory (Diaz et al., 2004). In conclusion, for the ﬁ rst time it is shown that the antibacterial activity of L. lilacina leaves methanol extract is due to the presence of acteoside, a compound largely distributed in the plant kingdom. As observed in this study and by other research groups, such substance should be better evaluated by pharmacological and chemical assays aiming at the pharmaceutical use, either in humans or animals.

ABSTRACT: The activity of crude extracts of three Rapanea species (Myrsinaceae) and Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Thirty-three extracts from different organs of these species were assayed and eleven of them showed significant activity (lysis % >50). The fractionation of an active extract from branches of R. lancifolia (99.5%) led to the isolation of two flavonoids: quercetin and taxifolin, which have weak trypanocidal activity. Additionally, one active extract from fruits of C. fruticosa (97.7%) afforded mexicanolide limonoids: cipadesin, mexicanolide, febrifugin and cipadesin A, that were slightly active on T. cruzi. Moreover, other two flavonoids (flavone and 7-methoxyflavone), previously assayed against T. cruzi, were isolated from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (100%). The results presented here suggest that the plants evaluated could be a source of new active compounds against T. cruzi.

It is caused by a flagellate protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted to humans by blood-sucking triatomine insects and by blood transfusion (WHO, 1997). With the control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans), infected blood transfusion is becoming the major cause for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). The only trypanocidal substance currently used to prevent the infection by this route is gentian violet, but its use is limited due to undesirable effects on the patients (Dias, 1993). The treatment of Chagas’ disease is still a challenge, since the only current available drug (benznidazole) has strong side effects (de Castro, 1993). Thus, the search for more efficient and less toxic drugs is needed to control this disease. In the past years, the study of compounds isolated from plants has received considerable attention in the search for alternative chemotherapy of parasitic diseases (Serrano et al., 2000) and many natural compounds have been identified as trypanocides (Duschak & Couto, 2007; 2 Guimarães & Faria, 2007). Several extracts from plants of Meliaceae and Rutaceae families have been showed in vitro activity against T. cruzi (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004; de Mesquita et al., 2005). Therefore, natural products constitute a promising source of new active compounds for treatment of Chagas’ disease. In this paper, we report the results of the evaluation of in vitro trypanocidal activity of 33 crude extracts from different organs of Rapanea lancifolia, R. guianensis, R. umbelata Myrsinaceae, and Cipadessa fruticosa Meliaceae. Moreover, it is showed the trypanocidal activity of flavonoids isolated from hexane extracts from branches of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa, as well the activity of four limonoids isolated from dichloromethane extract from fruits of C. fruticosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material Plants were collected in different states of Brazil and identified by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP and Dr. José Rubens Pirani from Department of Botany, USP, SP (Table 1).

Fernandes, Paulo C. Vieira, Maria F. das G. F. da Silva et al. giving four fractions. Fraction 4 was fractionated in the same conditions to yield compounds 1 (3.2 mg) and 2 (3.7 mg). The hexane extract (12.2 g) from branches of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 1524 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give nine fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1), affording nine fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2- MeOH (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 7 (16.7 mg) and 8 (8.2 mg). The dichloromethane extract from fruits (15.0 g) of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 180 g), was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, resulting in the fractions: hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:1); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1); EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Fractions CH2Cl2/ AcOEt (1:1) and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) were studied, as following described: the fraction CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1) (5.0 g) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography on silica gel using a gradient elution (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH), resulting in the four corresponding soluble fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (2.3 g) obtained from the last fractionation was several times chromatographed on silica gel and finally submitted to preparative HPLC to afford for limonoids 3 (19.4 mg), 5 (8.1 mg), and 6 (8.5 mg). Limonoid 4 (48.9 mg) was isolated from fraction EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) (4.6 g) of extract through several chromatographies on silica gel. Compounds 1-6 were identified through 1H and 13C NMR spectra, 1H - 1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC experiments and MS. The spectral data of 1 and 2 were in agreement with those published in the literature (Kuo et al., 1998; Moon et al., 2001) as well as the data of limonoids 3 (Luo et al., 2000), 4 (Paula, 1996), 5 (Govindachari & Kumari, 1998) and 6 (Leite et al. 2005a). Additionally, compounds 7 and 8 were characterized by comparison of 13C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975). The in vitro activity on T. cruzi of compounds 3 - 6 is described herein. On the other hand, the activities of compounds 1, 2, 7 and 8 were previously reported (Ambrozin et al., 2004; Tasdemir et al., 2006). Bioassay The bioassays were carried out according to the procedures described by Ambrozin et al. (2008). The activity of crude extracts was evaluated in triplicate at 4 mg/mL and pure substances at 250, 100, and 50 µg/ mL. It is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (µmol/L) for compounds 3-6 were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed against T. cruzi. The hexane extract (9.3 g) from branches of R. lancifolia (fresh weight: 1870 g) was fractionated through column chromatography on silica gel affording hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol fractions. The methanol fraction (1.5 g) was chromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, 3 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this work, we assessed the trypanocidal activity of 33 extracts of three Myrsinaceae and one Meliaceae species (Table 2). Eleven of them (33%) showed significant activity (lysis % > 50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. The majority of the extracts of C. fruticosa presented relevant activity. The best result was obtained from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH) that reduced 100% of the parasite number. The majority of the extracts of the three Rapanea species assayed did not present significant results, since several extracts led to the total lysis of the parasites and the red blood cells, as well. However, some extracts of these species showed high trypanocidal activity without affecting the red blood cells, such as the hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH). Similar studies involving the trypanocidal activity of Meliaceae and Rutaceae species have been reported by our group (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2008) showing that these plants can be considered a promising source of active compounds against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. Thus, the significant results obtained from the extracts of C. fruticosa are consistent with those previously reported for this family. The investigation of the methanol fraction of the active hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH) led to the isolation of the flavonol quercetin (1) Plant Plant part Solvent extraction Crude extract Lysis % Rapanea lancifolia (Myrsinaceae) hexane RLFLH 76.8 flowers dichloromethane RLFLD 72.2 methanol RLFLM TLa hexane RLLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RLLD TLa methanol RLLM TLa hexane RLBH 99.5 branches dichloromethane RLBD 7.0 methanol RLBM 47.69 hexane RGFLH TLa flowers dichloromethane RGFLD TLa methanol RGFLM TLa Rapanea guianensis (Myrsinaceae) hexane RGLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RGLD TLa methanol RGLM 68.5 hexane RGBH TLa branches dichloromethane RGBD TLa methanol RGBM 6.94 Hexane RUFRH TLa fruits dichloromethane RUFRD 69.4 Rapanea umbellata (Myrsinaceae) methanol RUFRM TLa hexane RURH TLa roots dichloromethane RURD TLa methanol RURM TLa hexane CFFRH 95.5 fruits dichloromethane CFFRD 97.7 methanol CFFRM 60.6 Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) Hexane CFLH 33.7 leaves dichloromethane CFLD 92.8 methanol CFLM 40.2 hexane CFBH 100 branches dichloromethane CFBD 76.1 methanol CFBM 42.0 Table 2.

Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Ana C. Leite, Artur Placeres Neto, Alessandra R. P. Ambrozin, João B. Fernandes, Paulo C. Vieira, Maria F. das G. F. da Silva et al. and the dihydrofl avonol taxifolin (2). Several biological activities have been reported for these fl avonoids. Quercetin (1), for example, presented antiprotozoal effect against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 = 14 µM), Trypanosoma brucei brucei (IC50 = 13.2 µM), Leishmania donovani (IC50 = 63.8 µM) (Camacho et al., 2002), T. brucei and T. rhodesiense (Williamson & Finnigan, 1978). In addition, this compound was described as a constituent of an aqueous extract from Lychnophora pinaster, Asteraceae which showed trypanocidal activity (Silveira et al., 2005). Recently, high leishmanicidal activity was described for such compound (Tasdemir et al., 2006). Compounds 1 and 2 were previously assayed on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, but showed low activity (Tasdemir et al., 2006). The relevant activity of the original extract (RLBH) is probably associated with the presence of other compounds or mixture of them. The mexicanolide limonoids 3-6, isolated from fruits of C. fruticosa, showed signifi cant trypanocidal activity (Table 3). They were obtained from the very active dichloromethane extract of fruits (Table 2, CFFRD, 97.7 %). This extract also afforded other limonoids (Leite et al., 2005a,b), which were not assayed herein. Recently, we reported the inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from T. cruzi. The results showed that crude extracts from C. fruticosa showed high ability to inhibit the enzyme activity (Leite et al., 2009). Thus, this specie could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against Chagas’ disease. In addition, the extracts from C. fruticosa showed high inhibition of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), a key enzyme from Leishmania that has been proposed as a target for the rational search of new leishmanicidal drugs (Ambrozin et al., 2005b). 5 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010 Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts The trypanocidal activity of flavone (7) and 7-methoxyflavone (8), isolated from the active hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH), was previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active fraction of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (Rutaceae), presented low activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (IC50 = 2116 and 787 µg/mL or 9531 and 1084 µmol/L, respectively) when compared with other flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004). Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites of C. fruticosa. As limonoids in the present work showed trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH extract may be associated with these compounds. Table 3.

In addition, the trypanocidal activity of plants of Myrsinaceae family and limonoids 3-6 are been disclosed for the first time.

No contexto de nossas pesquisas por novos agentes antifúngicos obtidos da flora brasileira, oito extratos e doze frações de Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, foram submetidos ao ensaio antifúngico pelo método de microdiluição, contra quatro espécies de fungos oportunistas, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis e Cryptococcus neoformans. Este trabalho revelou que os extratos e frações de P. nitens foram mais ativos contra C. krusei e C. parapsilosis quando comparados a C. neoformans, sendo que o crescimento de C. albicans foi moderadamente afetado por todos os extratos e frações. As atividades mais potentes foram observadas para as frações n-butanólica dos galhos (CIM = 15,6 µg/mL) e raízes (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL) contra C. krusei. Adicionalmente, a fração n-butanólica dos galhos foi submetida ao fracionamento cromatográfico, resultando no isolamento de quatro alcaloides guanidínicos, sendo N-1,N-2,N-3-tri- isopentenilguanidina (1), descrito pela primeira vez em espécies da família Fabaceae e nitensidinas A-C (2-4), os quais apresentaram atividade antifúngica moderada contra C. krusei (CIM = 62,5 µg/ mL) e C. parapsilosis (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL). Unitermos: Pterogyne nitens, alcaloides guanidínicos, antifúngico, fungos oportunistas, Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans. ABSTRACT: As part of our ongoing research on antifungal agents from Brazilian flora, eight extracts and twelve fractions from Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were screened for antimicrobial activity against four opportunistic fungi species (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans) using a broth microdilution method. The present investigation reveals that P. nitens extracts and fractions were more effective against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis than against C. neoformans. The growth of C. albicans was moderately affected by all tested extracts and fractions. The strongest effects were observed for n-butanol fractions from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/mL) and roots (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL) against C. krusei. Additionally, the chromatographic fractionation of the n-butanol fraction from branches afforded four guanidine alkaloids; N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine (1), described for the first time in the Fabaceae family, and nitensidines A-C (2-4), which showed moderate activity towards C. krusei (MIC = 62.5 µg/mL) and C. parapsilosis (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL).

INTRODUCTION The clinical relevance of opportunistic fungal infections have increased at an alarming rate in the second half of the twentyth century, including individuals infected with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer (Clark & Hajjeh, 2002; Hage et al., 2002). The most frequent causing agents of such infections are Candida, Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor and some unusual genera such as Fusarium, Trichosporon, 707 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(5): Out./Nov. 2010 Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi and Scedosporium (Guarro et al., 2006; Nucci & Anaissie, 2007). Furthermore, the most common treatment for these infectious diseases involves azoles and polyene macrolides, which are limited in their spectrum, and presenting severe side effects (Helmerhorst et al., 1999). For this reason, there is a need for new antifungal compounds which can serve as lead compounds for further development in antifungal chemotherapy. In this way, plants have been proven to be a rich source of antimicrobial agents (Vieira et al., 2005, Alves et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2006; Sena Filho et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007; Batista-Júnior et al., 2008; Cardoso-Lopes et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2008; Tempone et al., 2008; Bertucci et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2009a; Silva-Júnior et al., 2009). Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, is popularly named in South America as “tipa”, “yvi-raró”, “cocal”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” and “amendoim-bravo” according to the region where this plant grows. It is a sole beautiful legume tree from Pterogyne genus, which is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, reaching 5-12 m height (Burkart, 1952; Lorenzi, 1998). Cold aqueous preparations using stem barks has been used as folk medicine for treating of ascaridiasis (Crivos, 2007). Previous chemical and biological studies have demonstrated the presence of guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited cytotoxic activity against to human cancer cell lines (Bolzani et al., 1995; Ferreira et al., 2009; Regasini et al., 2007, 2009b,c) and phenolics with myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging activities (Fernandes et al., 2008; Regasini et al., 2008a,b,c; Souza et al., 2009; Souza et al., 2010). Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of extracts and fractions from branches, green fruits, roots and stem barks and isolated terpene guanidine alkaloids from P. nitens against four opportunistic human yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans), by using broth microdilution test. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material Roots, branches, green fruits and stem barks of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil) by Ph.D. Maria C. M. Young in January 2005 and identified by Ph.D. Inês Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP 204319b) was deposited at the State Herbarium \"Maria Eneida Kaufmann\" of Institute of Botany (São Paulo, Brazil). Extraction The powdered shade-dried plant material was extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane and, subsequently with ethanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation yielding a thick syrup. The crude ethanol extracts were further reconstituted in methanol-water (7:3) and then partitioned with ethyl acetate and n-butanol, successively. Samples from hexane and ethanol extracts, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and lyophilized hydroalcoholic fractions, were submitted to antimicrobial tests. Isolation of antifungal compounds 1-4 The n-butanol fraction (2.5 g) from the ethanol extract of branches was subjected to gel permeation column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol to afford nine fractions (B1-B9), which were combined after comparison of their TLC profile [chloroform:methanol (9:1)] revealed with Dragendorff´s reagent. The alkaloidal fraction (B2, 587 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase C-18 silica gel CC eluted with acetonitrile:water gradient that afforded eight fractions (ALK1-ALK8). Purification of fraction ALK5 (121 mg) by repeated CC over silica gel (230-400 mesh) eluted with chloroform:methanol in a gradient ranging from 0 to 35% methanol, furnished N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine (1, 7 mg) and nitensidine B (3, 12 mg). Fraction ALK-8 (88 mg) was subject to preparative TLC developed with ch loroform:methanol:triethylamine (87:12.5:0.5), developed three times to yield nitensidine A (2, 7 mg) and nitensidine C (4, 3 mg). The molecular structures of these guanidine alkaloids were identified through 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS data. The spectral data were in agreement with those published in the literature (Bolzani et al., 1995; Conegero et al., 2003). N N N H H N H H N NH N H N NH H N Me Me N NH 1 2 3 4 708 Rev. Bras.

Microorganisms and growth conditions The test organisms C. albicans ATCC 90028, C. krusei ATCC 6258, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and C. neoformans ATCC 90012 were originally obtained from the Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at São Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 to 48 h at room temperature. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing The antifungal activity tests were performed using broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications (Rodriguez- Tudela et al., 2003). The medium used was RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. Samples were diluted in DMSO and each well of a 96-well U-bottomed culture plate were added 100 µL culture together with 100 µL of 2-fold serial diluted test compound. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be 1 x 105 to 5 x 105 CFU/mL. This suspension was inoculated on the microdilution plate previously prepared with the extracts, fractions and compounds 1-4 diluted at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL. The plates were incubated with agitation at 37 °C for 24 h for Candida spp. and 48 h for C. neoformans. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were used as positive controls exhibiting a MIC value ranging from 2.00 to 0.06 and 64.00 to 2.00 µg/mL (Table 1). The MIC values were calculated as the lowest concentration of the test samples which shows complete growth inhibition of the fungi strains. Results were analyzed visually and spectrophotometrically. All assays were performed in triplicate. The extracts and fractions showing a MIC lower than 100, ranging from 100-500, 500-1000 and over 1000 µg/mL were considered potent, moderated, weak and not active, respectively (Holetz et al., 2002). Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) All tested samples in antifungal study showing MIC<1000 µg/mL, were transferred to plates of Sabouraud- dextrose agar. The plates were incubated at 35 oC for 48 h (yeast). The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that did not permit any visible fungal colony growth on the appropriate agar plate after the period of incubation. All assays were performed in triplicate. RESULTS In this work, eight extracts and twelve fractions as well as four guanidine alkaloids (1-4) were tested at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL against four human opportunistic yeasts (C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. neoformans). These results were summarized in Table 1. All extracts and fractions from Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were weakly active against the yeast C. albicans with MIC values ranging from 1000 to 250 µg/ mL, which were considered moderate to weak according to Holetz et al. (2002). The hexane extract from roots was not active to C. albicans and C. neoformans (MIC>1000 µg/mL). The extracts and fractions from roots and green fruits demonstrated moderate activity against C. krusei, except the n-butanol fraction from roots, which presented strong activity (MIC 31.2 µg/mL) against this yeast. Additionally, branches and stem barks exhibited potent activity against C. krusei with MIC values ranging from 15.6 to 62.5 µg/mL and the best result was observed for the n-butanol fraction from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/ mL). Furthermore the hexane extracts and hydroalcoholic fractions from branches and stem barks showed moderate to weak activity against this yeast. All the samples had weak to moderate activity against C. parapsilosis and C. neoformans, except for the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions from stem barks, which exhibited potent inhibition of C. parapsilosis (MIC = 62.5 µg/mL). Compounds 1-4 isolated from n-butanol fraction of branches from P. nitens inhibits the growth of opportunistic fungi with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.2 μg/ mL against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, respectively. Additionally, minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of all extracts, fractions and guanidine alkaloids (1-4) were also evaluated against the four yeasts and showed MFC values higher than 1000 µg/mL, indicating a fungistatic behavior. DISCUSSION Several Fabaceae species have been evaluated for their antifungal properties (Scorzoni et al., 2007) among them Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, a typical leguminous plant from Brazilian flora has been studied for antimicrobial activity. Previous biological studies have demonstrated that extracts from the barks of P. nitens did not show antibacterial activity (Salvat et al., 2001). The bioactivity presented for compounds 1-4 indicated that antifungal activity observed in the extracts and fractions may be at least partially due to guanidine alkaloids. It was also observed that the strongest antifungal effects of the tested samples were on strains of C. krusei and C. parapsilosis when compared with C. albicans and C. neoformans. P. nitens and isolated compounds displayed 709 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 20(5): Out./Nov. 2010 Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi activity against C. krusei, which is very significant because this yeast has natural resistance against commercial drug fluconazole (Rex et al., 1995), suggesting its potential application for treating C. krusei infections, considering a possible mode of action different from those azole drugs. The current study suggests that P. nitens have antimicrobial activity against opportunistic yeasts. Therefore, it could be an important source of antifungal compounds which can be useful for developing new lead compounds, including compound 1, which was described for the first time in the Fabaceae family. Further chemical and pharmacological investigations are thus needed in order to isolate and identify additional constituents and establish the potential mechanisms of action.

Abstract: Ethyl acetate extracts of cultures grown in liquid Czapek and on solid rice media of the fungal endophyte Fusarium oxysporum SS46 isolated from the medicinal plant Smallanthus sonchifolius (Poepp.) H. Rob., Asteraceae, exhibited considerable cytotoxic activity when tested in vitro against human cancer cells. Chromatographic separation yielded anhydrofusarubin (1) and beauvericin (2) that were identified based on their 1H and 13C NMR data. Compounds 1 and 2 showed the strongest cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines. Compound 2 also showed promising activity against Leishmania braziliensis. Hexanic extract of F. oxysporum SS50 grown on solid rice media also afforded a mixture of compounds that displayed cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines. Chemical analysis of the mixture of compounds, investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), showed that there was a predominance of methyl esters of fatty acids and alkanes. Keywords: beauvericin citotoxic activity endophytic fungus Fusarium oxysporum Leishmania braziliensis Introduction Microorganisms are recognized as proliﬁ c producers of bioactive natural products, many of them useful as clinical drugs (Gunatilaka, 2006; Newman & Cragg, 2012). Newman and Gragg (2012) recently emphasized that efforts to discover new bioactive natural products should focus on microorganisms living in interactions with their hosts. Endophytes are one type of such microorganisms, since they spend the whole or part of their lifespan inside the healthy tissues of the host inter- and/or intracellularly without causing discernible symptoms of plant disease (Borges et al., 2009). Natural products from fungal endophytes have a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as antimicrobial, immunosuppressant, anticancer, and also may act as biocontrol agents (Gunatilaka, 2006; Borges et al., 2009). As part of our ongoing research on endophytic fungi found in association with Asteraceae species we have identiﬁ ed several bioactive extracts and compounds, as well as novel natural products (Gallo et al.; 2009; 2010; Guimarães et al., 2010; Borges et al., 2011). In this paper, we report the chemical and biological of two fungal strains of Fusarium oxysporum, coded as SS46 and SS50, isolated as endophytes from the medicinal plant Smallanthus sonchifolius (Asteraceae). Materials and Methods General procedures 1D (regular 1H and 13C) and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on Bruker spectrometer (DPX-500), working at 500 MHz for 1H, and at 125 MHz for 13C. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference. Column chromatographies were performed over silica gel 60, 230-280 mesh Article Bioactive extracts and chemical constituents of two endophytic strains of Fusarium oxysporum Andréa M. do Nascimento et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 22(6): Nov./Dec. 2012 1277 (Ultra Chem) or Sephadex LH-20. Vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) was carried out silica gel 60 H, 70-230 mesh (Merck). Thin-Layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on sílica gel 60 GF254 (Merck). Spots were located by spraying with anisaldehyde– sulfuric acid reagent, heated at 110 °C. Isolation of strains The endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the roots of S. sonchifolius according to the procedure described by Gallo et al. (2009). After collection, the plant material was washed with water and surface sterilized by immersion in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), followed by 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30”, 60” or 90”), and ﬁnally with 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min). After these procedures, the leaves and roots were rinsed with sterilized water. This latter water was incubated in Petri dishes to ensure the elimination of all epiphytic microorganisms. Small pieces of the leaves and roots were excised and placed on agar in Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 30 °C. Individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on PDA slants. Fermentation and extraction procedures Both F. oxysporum strains were cultured in liquid Czapek and solid rice media. Liquid cultures were conducted in two steps. First, the silica stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incubated at 30 oC for seven days. After this period, the pre-inoculum was prepared by transferring the agar plugs (0.5 cm diameter) cut from the 7-day-old original cultures into 50 mL Falcon flasks containing 10 mL of rich medium (5 g tryptone, 10 g dextrose, 3 g yeast extract, 10 g malt extract, in 1000 mL final volume of H2O, pH 6.2±0.2), and incubated for three days at 25 oC, 120 rpm. After this period, the pre-inoculum (20 mL) was transferred to a 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 mL of Czapek medium and incubated at 25 oC for 14 or 21 days (120 rpm). Nine Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. After 21 days 200 mL of ethanol were added to each flask, the resulting suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid- liquid partition with ethyl acetate. The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate extracts (EaL). Fermentations of F. oxysporum SS46 and F. oxysporum SS50 carried out for fourteen days yielded, respectively, 1.4289 g (coded SS46-EaL14) and 1.0884 g (coded SS50-EaL14) of EaL extracts. After 21 days of incubation, F. oxysporum SS46 yielded 0.8082 g of EaL extract (coded SS46-EaL). F. oxysporum SS50 was cultured only for 14 days. A Falcon flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting pre-inoculum was transferred to Czapek medium and treated in the same way for control purposes. The solid fermentation experiments were carried out in ten 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 mL distilled water per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 oC for 40 min for each fungal strain. Agar plugs (about 2 x 2 cm) cut from the 7-day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 21 days incubation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 oC, 150 mL of methanol were added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The methanol was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the methanol extract, which was submitted to the liquid-liquid partition with hexane and ethyl acetate. The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the hexanic and ethyl acetate extracts. Solid culture of F. oxysporum SS46 afforded 0.41 g of the hexanic extract (SS46-HxS) and 2.89 g of the ethyl acetate extract (SS46-EaS). Fermentation of F. oxysporum SS50 yielded 0.16 g of the hexanic extract (SS50-HxS) and 0.84 g and ethyl acetate extract (SS50- EaS). Isolation of compounds The SS46-EaS extract (2.77 g) was chromatographed by vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) on silica gel and eluted with hexane, hexane/ethyl acetate (gradient), ethyl acetate/methanol (gradient) and methanol to give ten fractions (F1-F10). Fraction F5 (100 mg) was puriﬁed by chromatography on a Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as eluent to give 1 (5.2 mg). The SS46-EaL extract (89 mg) was puriﬁed by chromatography on a column packed with silica gel 60. Elution with hexane/ethyl acetate 8:2 and 2:8, (crescent gradient), ethyl acetate/methanol 19:1 and methanol 100% afforded twenty fractions, which were combined in nine sub-fractions according to TLC analysis. The sub-fraction 7 (6.1 mg) was identified as 2. The SS50- HxS extract (155.4 mg), obtained after 21 days on rice medium, was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) The SS50-HxS extract was analyzed on a Shimadzu QP-2010 gas chromatograph interfaced to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The following conditions were used: DB-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm); helium (99.999%) carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.1 mL/min; 1 μL injection volume; injector split ratio of 1:40; injector temperature 240 °C; electron impact Bioactive extracts and chemical constituents of two endophytic strains of Fusarium oxysporum Andréa M. do Nascimento et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 22(6): Nov./Dec. 2012 1278 mode at 70 eV; ion-source temperature 280 ºC. The oven temperature was programmed from 100 ºC (isothermal for 5 min), with an increase of 10 ºC/min to 250 ºC (isothermal for 5 min), and 10 ºC/min to 280 ºC (isothermal for 15 min). A mixture of linear hydrocarbons (C9H20-C40H82) was injected under the same conditions as standards, and identification of constituents performed by comparing the spectra obtained with those of the equipment’s database (Wiley 7 lib), and by using the Kovats Index, calculated for each constituent as previously described (Adams, 1995; Van den Dool & Kratz, 1963). Cytotoxic bioassay Human tumor cell lines MDA-MB435 (melanoma), HCT-8 (colon), and SF295 (brain) were obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cytotoxic effect was assessed using the MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability described by Mosmann (1983) according to an established protocol. Briefly, tumor cells were placed in 96-well plates at the following densities: 0.7 × 105 (HCT-8), 0.6 × 105 (SF295), and 0.1 × 106 (MDA-MB435) cells/mL. Extracts were tested in a single concentration (50 μg/mL) and pure compounds in a range between 0.39 and 25 μg/mL during 72 h. Control groups received the same amount of vehicle and doxorubicin (Doxolem®, Zodiac Produtos Farmacêuticos S/A, Brazil), which was used as a positive control. Growth inhibition rates were quantified as the percentage of control absorbance by the reduced dye at 550 nm in accordance with the following equation: Inhibition rate = [(OD control well – OD treated well) x (OD control well)-1] x 100. Each sample was tested in two independent experiments performed in triplicates. The results consisted of the average value for each experimental unit. The IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were obtained by non linear regression using the GraphPad Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). An activity scale was utilized to appraise the cytotoxic potential of the tested samples: inactive samples (I), samples with low activity (LA, cell growth inhibition between 1-50%), moderated activity (MA, cell growth inhibition between 50-75%), and high activity (HA, cell growth inhibition between 75-100%). Leishmanicidal assay The L. braziliensis strain H3227 (MHOM/ BR/94/H-3227) used in this study was kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Aldina Barral (Professor of Immunology, Centro de Pesquisas Gonçalo Moniz, FIOCruz-Bahia, Brazil). The parasites were maintained in vitro in M199 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) at 26 ºC supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2% human urine, 20 mM HEPES, 4 mM NaHCO3, 10 U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (GIBCO). The anti-promastigote assay was carried out according to the method of Dutta et al. (2005). Beauvericin (2) was serially diluted from 0.02 to 10 µM in Schneider's medium (supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% human urine) containing 2 x 105 parasites/mL. A total of 4 x 104 parasites were seeded per well in 96-well microplates incubated at 26 °C until the end of the log phase. After, 100 μg of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dissolved in 10 μL of PBS was added per well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Following incubation, the plates were centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and precipitated formazan was dissolved in 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbance was measured at 492 nm, and the data for two independent assays performed in triplicate were analyzed by non-linear regression with variable slope (Graph Pad Prism 5.0 software). The EC50 was defined as the effective drug concentration that inhibits parasite proliferation by 50% compared with a non-treated culture. Geneticin (G418) was used as a positive control (EC50 0.007 μM). Results and Discussion Extracts obtained after fourteen days of incubation of both endophytic fungi in liquid Czapek medium did not show any relevant cytotoxic activity. The best incubation time for production of cytotoxic compounds was 21 days, in both liquid and solid media. The most active extracts were found to be SS50-HxS and SS46-EaL, which showed high cytotoxic activities against the three cancer cell lines (Table 1). Extract SS46-EaS also showed high activity against HCT-8 cells and moderate activity against SF295 cells. Interestingly, F. oxysporum SS46 produced bioactive ethyl acetate extracts in both liquid and solid media. On the other hand, F. oxysporum SS50 produced bioactive compounds of lower polarity only in solid medium, as observed for the high activities of SS50-HxS extract. In our previous investigation, F. oxysporum SS46 had already produced high cytotoxic ethyl acetate extracts; however no cytotoxic activity had been detected for F. oxysporum SS50 (Gallo et al., 2009). This result can be explained by the different extraction methods, because in that previous screening all the fungal solid cultures extracts were partitioned only with ethyl acetate. Chemical investigation was focused on the most active extracts: SS46-EaS, SS46-EaL and SS50-HxS.

The SS50-HxS extract was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-seven components were detected in this extract, and twelve of them (76.8%) were identified by the GC- MS data (Table 2). According to our results, there is a predominance of alkanes and fatty acid methyl esters in this extract and the main constituents are: (9Z,12Z)- octadecadienoic acid methyl ester (54.45%), methyl hexadecanoate (9.73%) and (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl ester (4.70%). Fifteen compounds remained unidentified because the spectral data could not be associated with any compound database system (Wiley lib 7). The analysis of hexane rice-control extract (without fungus), showed that there is little correlation in their chemical composition. There are only five compounds in common in the extracts: 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-methylpropyl) ester, methyl hexadecanoate, (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, clionasterol and stigmast-4-en-3-one. Therefore, seven compounds differentiate the SS50-HxS extract from the culture medium control extract: (2E, 4E)- decadienal, pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane octadecane, (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester and dehydroergosterol. All extracts analyzed in this study differed considerably in their secondary metabolites. The SS50-HxS showed pronounced cytotoxicity against the three human cancer cell lines. As the major components of the hexane extract are a mixture of three methyl esters (methyl hexadecanoate, (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl ester and (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester), which represents 68.88% of the extract, presumably they should be responsible for the high cytotoxic activity of the crude extract. The culture medium control extract did not show cytotoxic activity (Table 1). This extract also contains a fatty acid methyl esters mixture, but a mixture of two and only a lesser amount, methyl hexadecanoate or methyl palmitate, (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, representing only 17.41% crude extract.

Previously reported data found that another mixture of three fatty acid methyl esters (methyl myristate, methyl palmitate and methyl stearate), isolated from the ascidian Didemnum psammatodes, also showed high cytotoxic activity and antiproliferative effects against four cell lines leukemia. The mechanism of action of these fatty acid methyl esters was found to involve inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of both necrosis and apoptosis (Takeara et al., 2008). The major constituent of this mixture is the methyl palmitate or methyl hexadecanoate, also identified as one of the three constituents of the mixture of methyl esters present in the SS50-HxS extract. Still according to the literature, when each methyl ester blend was tested separately, the cytotoxic activity decreased, suggesting that a synergistic effect of the mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (Takeara et al., 2008). The SS46-EaS extract exhibited high cytotoxicity against the colon cancer cells (84.82%) and moderate cytotoxicity against central nervous system cancer cells (67.02%) (Table 1). This extract was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography, and subsequent purification of the resulting fractions by chromatographic techniques resulted Bioactive extracts and chemical constituents of two endophytic strains of Fusarium oxysporum Andréa M. do Nascimento et al.

The SS46-EaL extract showed the higher cytotoxicities against the three human cancer cell lines: colon (100.0 %), melanoma (99.32%) and central nervous system (100.0%). The SS46-EaL extract was fractionated by column chromatography resulting in the isolation of compound 2. Analysis of the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HMQC and HMBC spectra, together with HRESIMS data and comparison to literature data, led to the identification of compounds 1 and 2 as the naphthoquinone anhydrofusarubin and the cyclo-hexadepsipeptide beauvericin, respectively (Kurobane et al., 1980; Zhan et al, 2007). The occurrence of naphthoquinone 1 and cyclo- hexadepsipeptide 2 has been previously reported in the genus Fusarium (Tatum & Baker, 1983). O O O OH OH H3CO O O N O O O N O O O N O 1 2 CH3 The cytotoxic activities of compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated in vitro against the three cancer cell lines. Anhydrofusarubin (1) and beauvericin (2) presented significant cytotoxicity against all the evaluated cancer cells, and the IC50 values ranged from 2.39 to 9.85 μg/ mL (Table 3). Anhydrofusarubin (1) was recently isolated from a marine Fusarium sp. strain and showed selective cytotoxicity against human oral carcinoma cell lines (KB cells) and breast cancer (MCF-7) (Trisuwan et al., 2010). It has been reported previously in the literature in vitro cytotoxic activity of beauvericin (2), also isolated from an endophytic F. oxysporum strain, in other cell lines of human cancer (Zhan et al., 2007). Compound 2 is an ionophore able to transport cations across the membranes, especially calcium, leading to the cytotoxic effects (Zhan et al, 2007; Wang & Xu, 2012). As part of our research interest in finding antiparasitic compounds, beauvericin (2) was tested in vitro against promastigotes of Leishmania braziliensis, and showed EC50 1.86 μM. Therefore, compound 2 can be considered an interesting leishmanicidal natural product for further structure diversification. Beauvericin (2) had already been reported as a bioactive compound against other cancer lines, HIV1 virus and bacterial strains (Wang & Li, 2012). We now report the activity of beauvericin against different cancer lines and, for the first time, against L. braziliensis. This study demonstrated that strains of fungal endophytes, identified as the same species and isolated from the same plant tissue, may vary considerably in the class of secondary metabolites produced. They may also produce different compounds depending on culturing conditions. F. oxysporum SS46 produced compound 1 in solid medium, and the cyclo-hexadepsipeptide 2 in liquid medium, both compounds extracted with ethyl acetate after 21 days of fungal fermentation. These compounds have important antiproliferative properties selective for cancer cells that might explain the cytotoxicities observed for the extracts. There was no production of these compounds by F. oxysporum SS50, which synthesizes predominantly fatty acid methyl esters and alkanes in solid medium. Table 3.

We have recently reported the isolation and biological activities of some compounds of R. echinata.2 In continuation of our search for trypanocidal compounds and natural products to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants, we have investigated the methanol extracts of stems and leaves of R. echinata leading to the isolation of typical rutaceous furoquinoline alkaloids: the widespread skimmianine (1), kokusaginine (2), maculine (3), flindersiamine (4) and also the quinolone derivatives: 2-n- nonyl-4-quinolone (5), 1-methyl-2-n-nonyl-4-quinolone (6) and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-quinolone(7).

Os alcalóides isolados mostraram atividade antifúngica contra Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, o fungo simbionte de formigas cortadeiras (Atta spp). Quando testados in vitro contra formas tripomastigotas de Trypanosoma cruzi, os alcalóides foram inativos ou parcialmente ativos. Neste trabalho descrevem-se o isolamento dos alcalóides, a elucidação estrutural dos alcalóides quinolônicos e a estrutura obtida por difração de raio-X da flindersiamina, juntamente com os resultados dos bioensaios realizados. Phytochemical survey of stems and leaves extracts of the South Brazilian endemic plant Raulinoa echinata Cowan, Rutaceae, led to the isolation of known furoquinoline alkaloids: the widespread skimmianine; kokusaginine, maculine, flindersiamine, and also quinolone derivatives: 1-methyl-2-n-nonyl-4-quinolone, 2-n-nonyl-4-quinolone and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone. These alkaloids showed antifungal activity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus; the symbiotic fungus of leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens). They were inactive or displayed weak inhibitory activity when assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. In this paper, the isolation, structure elucidation and bioactivity results of these compounds are reported together with the X-ray structure of flindersiamine. Keywords: Raulinoa echinata, furoquinoline and quinolone alkaloids, antifungal, Trypanosoma cruzi, X-ray structure determination 67 Biological Activity of Quinoline Alkaloids from Raulinoa echinata Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002 of these insects has been the aim of many studies. Their control can be achieved by inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus. Trypanocidal compounds are important for the treatment of Chagas´ disease which is responsible for a considerable number of deaths in Central and South American countries. In this paper we describe the isolation, structural determination and evaluation of the activity of furoquinoline alkaloids as inhibitors of the growth of the symbiotic fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus of leaf- cutting ants. The alkaloids were also assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Experimental General experimental procedures NMR spectra: a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C was used. All spectra were run in CDCl3 using TMS as internal standard. For GC-MS analysis was used a Shimadzu GC-17 A gas chromatograph fitted with a fused silica DB-1 (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 µm film thickness) capillary column, with helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2.6 mL.min-1. The temperature was programmed initially at 70 °C for 1 min, then increased with a rate of 10 °C.min-1 to 280 °C and kept for 15 min. The injection volume was 1 µL in a split mode and temperatures of the detector/injector were 300 °C/280 °C respectively. The chromatograph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass selective detector at 70 eV with scans from 50 to 500 amu. X-ray crystallographic data were recorded on an Enraf- Nonuis CAD-4 diffractometer using graphite monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and ω/2θ scan mode at room temperature (291 K). During data collection, the intensity of three standard reflections were monitored every 30 min of X-ray exposure time showing no significant decay. Direct Methods solved the structure. H atoms were placed in calculated positions with fixed C-H distances (0.93 Å for Csp2 and 0.96 Å for Csp3), each riding on a carrier atom with isotropic displacement parameters amounting to 1.5 (for methyl H atoms) or 1.2 (for the other H atoms) times the value of the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter of the carrier atom. The CAD-4 Software3 was used for data collection; cell refinement was done on 25 centred reflections (10.23<θ<18.11o),3 data reduction: XCAD4,4 program used to solve the structure: SIR92;5 program used to refine structure: SHELXL97;6 software used to prepare material for publication and deposition: SHELXL97,6 PARST957 and WinGX.8 Plant material Stems and leaves of R. echinata were collected in Ressacada, Ibirama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade de São Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited in the Herbário Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of compounds The dried and powdered stems (5 kg) and leaves (3 kg) were extracted with hexane and MeOH. Successively, half part (100.00 g) of the MeOH stems extract was fractionated over silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) into three fractions: CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The methanol fraction (89 g) was dissolved in H2O-MeOH (3:7) and successively partitioned using solvents of increasing polarity (hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc), affording the correspondent sub fractions. The CH2Cl2 sub fraction (2 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (9:1 and gradient) to furnish the compounds (in eluting order): maculine (3) (36 mg), flindersiamine (4) (32 mg), kokusaginine (2) (42 mg), skimmianine (1) (29 mg), and the alkaloid 7 (10 mg). The MeOH leaves extract (100 g) was also submitted to liquid partition with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. Column chromatography (silica gel 230-400 mesh, hexane- acetone 7:3) of the leaves hexane fraction (10 g) yielded compounds 5 (600 mg) and 6 (300 mg). All the furoquinoline alkaloids described above (except flindersiamine) were also found in the leaves extract in considerable amounts. Identification of the isolated compounds The isolated alkaloids skimmianine9 (1), kokusaginine10 (2), maculine9 (3), and flindersiamine11 (4) presented spectral data in agreement with the literature.

Fungicidal assay The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus Singer (Rozites gongylophora Möller) was isolated from a Atta sexdens Forel nest, kept in culture media and the fungicidal activity was performed according to established protocols.15 Trypanocidal activity The in vitro trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (Y strain) lethality assay was also performed according to established protocols.16 Results and Discussion Compounds 1-4 were respectively identified as skimmianine, kokusaginine, maculine and flindersiamine, by comparison with the spectral data described in the literature.9-11 Flindersiamine (4) has a methoxy group attached to C8, but spectroscopic data published could not furnish clear evidence of this moiety. In an attempt to confirm the extra methoxy group position on the furoquinoline nucleus, nOe experiments were performed. According to these experiments, by irradiation on the C4 methoxy group only the furan H3 signal was enhanced. Also, when the singlet corresponding to the quinoline hydrogen was irradiated, no enhancement was observed for the methoxy group as expected. These questionable irradiation results of 4 were verified by HMBC experiments. Unexpectedly, the C4 methoxy group showed correlation with the quinoline hydrogen. In order to solve these unclear findings, an X-ray analysis (Figure 1) was performed to confirm the C8 methoxy group position. The molecule is planar except for C11, in fact the rms deviation for 16 non-H atoms fitted to the best least squares plane through them is of 0.026 and C11 being 1.069(3) Å out of that plane. A net of hydrogen bonds as shown in Table 3 joins the molecules in the crystal. Special attention should be given to a C-H...π interaction and following Zukerman-Schpector et al.17 this Figure 1.

(symmetry operation: i = 1-x, -0.5+y, 1.5-z). Whether all the cited interactions are true hydrogen bonds is difficult to assert, because as pointed out by Cotton et al.,18 “..the field is getting muddier and muddier as the definition of a hydrogen bond is relaxed.” In any case they are worth to be taken into account. The crystallographic data obtained for the alkaloid 4 confirmed the previous HMBC spectroscopic attributions, but not the results obtained by nOe experiments. The structures of compounds 5, 6 and 7 were elucidated on the basis of 1H NMR and EIMS spectra and carbon attributions were made by HMBC and HSQC correlation spectra. Data are presented on Table 2. Crude extracts of leaves and stems as well as fractions of R. echinata showed good inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth. Among the isolated compounds of these fractions, each of the alkaloids 1-5 maintained or showed higher inhibition of the fungal growth at 100 mg mL-1 (Table 1), compared with the original extracts. Contrary to the expectations, at a 50 µg mL-1 dose the inhibitory effect was quite strongly reduced. In general, furoquinoline alkaloids showed higher activity than quinolones. Probably, the activity demonstrated by the methanol extract of leaves (fraction hexane) is due to the high concentration of total alkaloids, both furoquinoline and quinolone derivatives. Only the quinolinone alkaloids 5 and 6 displayed some moderate activity on trypomastigote forms (Y strain) of T. cruzi with IC50 of 134.9 and 100.9 µg mL-1 respectively. Fungicidal activities have been described for these alkaloids against plant pathogens Cladosporium cucumerinum19 and Phytophthora spp.20 4-Quinolones containing long alkyl chains at C-2 were first obtained from microorganisms (from Pseudomonas, also called pseudans21) and have been also isolated from rutaceous genera, mainly Evodia,22 Boronia,23 Ruta13 and Esenbeckia.24 Species from the former genus are used in Chinese herbal medicine and the isolated alkaloids have demonstrated inhibitory activity against the bacteria Helicobacter pilori.25,26 Furoquinoline alkaloids have also demonstrated in vitro activity against Leishmania spp and Plasmodium falciparum.27,28 Acknowledgements We wish to thank Prof. A.

Astilbina (3-β-O-rhamnosideo de 5,7,3’,4’– tetraidroxi-2,3-diidroflavonol) isolada dos pedúnculos e flores como o seu principal componente, apresentou atividade inseticida sobre abelhas confinadas. Os resultados obtidos indicam que a astilbina reduz a sobrevivência média das abelhas tratadas. In this communication we have evaluated the toxic properties of methanol extracts from flowers, peduncles, leaves, petioles and stem bark of Dimorphandra mollis to Apis mellifera workers. Astilbin (5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxy–2,3-dihydroflavonol-3-β-O-rhamnoside) has been isolated from peduncles and flowers of this plant in large amounts. Astilbin presented insecticidal activity against confined bees. The results suggest that astilbin reduces the average survival of treated bees. Keywords: flavonoids, natural insecticides, Dimorphandra mollis, Apis mellifera Introduction Dimorphandra mollis Benth. (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae)1 is a very common tree that occurs from south to west in Brazil. There are no references about the occurrence of this species in other parts of the world. Two plant species have been popularly known as “barbatimão”: Stryphnodendron adstringens (true “barbatimão”) and Dimorphandra mollis (false “barbatimão”).1 In spite of belonging to different genera, both species are sympatric (similar blooming period), from September to January, and the pollen of Stryphnodendron polyphyllum has been reported to be toxic to bees.2 Considering that while plants produce substances attractive to bees, they need to protect other parts, as well as flower bud, generally the place where bees collect substances to make propolis, from herbivore attack. This defense is commonly made by repellents, deterrents or even by toxic chemical compounds.3 Field observations by Brazilian beekeepers revealed that D. mollis is toxic to bees during blooming season. The aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of the compounds isolated from flowers, peduncles, leaves, petioles and stem bark of D. mollis against workers of A. mellifera. Results and Discussion Dichloromethane and methanol extracts of flowers, peduncles, leaves, petioles and stem bark, were prepared (Table 1) and tested in toxic bioassays against bees, applying a sucrose and honey diet of 30 mg per bee, Table 1.

The methanol extracts of flowers, part of the plant highly visited by the bees, and also the extracts of peduncles and stem bark were actives (Figure 1, Table 2). After twelve days for the high concentrated flowers and peduncles extracts tested all the bees died, while in the control the workers died after 22-25 days. The methanol extract from the stem bark showed to be active, killing all the bees within 8 days. The toxic bioassays were accomplished by Log Rank test4 and all active test had p< 0.0001. From the methanol extracts of peduncles and flowers, astilbin (1) was isolated (crystallization from methanol/ hexane, 1:1) as a major component (its concentration is higher than 99 % in this extract), while the methanol extracts of the stem bark afforded mixture of astilbin, as the major constituent (60.6 %), neoisoastilbin (2, 16.6 %) and catechin (3, 9.0 %). These compounds were identified by comparison of their spectral data with those in the literature for astilbin,5 neoisoastilbin5 and catechin.6, 7 Table 2. χ2 and p of the control survivorship curves and of different concentrations curves.

Surprisingly the stem bark methanol extract was highly active (Figure 1, Table 2), therefore separate bioassays with neoisoastilbin and catechin will be necessary to confirm the activity of each component of the mixture and if there is a synergism between them, and to determine whether 2 or 3 is more active than 1. However, since astilbin is the major component in all active extracts analyzed, it could be responsible for the main observed activity of D. mollis against workers of A. mellifera. Previous work with Lonchocarpus speciosus extracts, containing astilbin in mixture with others flavonoids, showed insecticidal effects against Drosophila melonogaster flies.8 Astilbin exhibits a variety of other biological activities such as reducing total liver cholesterol concentration,9 protecting against oxidative damage to liver mitochondria and hemolysis erytrocytes,10 inhibiting lens aldose reductase to prevent cataract formation in diabetes,11 enhancement of the vanadate-stimulated release of lipoprotein lipase activity,12 and hepatoprotective effect in rats13 and mices.14 Experimental Plant material The flower peduncles (161 g), petioles (220 g), leaves (650 g), stems bark (600 g) and flowers (450 g) of D. mollis were collected in Rio Claro, São Paulo state Brazil, in February of 1999. These parts were dried separately in a stove with air circulation (40 oC) and milled in a Willey mill type. Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituents The extraction of the plant material was performed with dichloromethane (3 times) followed by methanol (2 times). The amount of solvent used each time in the extraction of the dry material were 0,5 L for peduncles and petioles; 1,0 L for flowers and 1,5 L for leaves and stem bark. Catechin (17.1 mg) and the mixture of astilbin and neoisoastilbin (160.5 mg) were separated by preparative flash chromatography from part of methanol extract of stem bark (190 mg). The mixture of astilbin and neoisoastilbin (25 mg) was submitted to recycling HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID x 50.0 cm L) eluted with MeOH (Flow rate: 7 mL min-1 UV detector at 290 nm) yielding astilbin (18 mg), neoisoastilbin (5 mg), after five cycles of 30 min. Biological assay Africanized bees Apis mellifera were collected at the UNESP- Rio Claro apiary. Newly emerged bees were identified on the basis of their color and collected. All bees used for the experiments had the same age. The extracts or astilbin were incorporated in small percentages (0.2 %, 0.5 % and 1 %) to the bees artificial diet. The diet consisted of sucrose and honey (5:1) and was given as such to the control group. The diet was offered to sixty bees divided into three groups of twenty bees confined in small cages (11 cm X 11 cm X 7 cm). For a higher survival average the bees were confined in groups of twenty.15 The control group received just the diet and water daily. The experiments were performed during 25 days, at 32 ºC, in a BOD apparatus and the number of dead bees was registered. The daily survival rates for each treatment was calculated and the survival curves were traced using the Software Graphpad Prism 2.01. The non-parametric test of Log Rank4 was applied a posteriori, to compare each treatment with the control group.

Bolzani* Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista, CP 355, 14800-900 Araraquara - SP, Brazil As células estão continuamente expostas a uma série de fatores que exercem estresse oxidativo o qual gera várias patologias que estão relacionadas a fatores de senescência tais como doenças coronárias, artrites reumática, e câncer. Para combater esse efeito, os organismos vivos desenvolveram uma rede complexa de antioxidantes que agem contra essas espécies radicalares nocivas à vida. Com o intuito de fazer uma bioprospecção de espécies vegetais da Mata Atlântica e Cerrados brasileiros estabelecemos uma metodologia para detetar compostos com atividade antioxidante. A combinação de CLAE a um detetor eletroquímico permitiu a detecção de micromoléculas antioxidantes nos extratos brutos das folhas de Chimmarhis turbinata (DC). Foi possível detectar e identificar nas matrizes naturais os compostos responsáveis após comparação com padrões isolados da mesma espécie. Living cells are continuously exposed to a variety of challenges that exert oxidative stress and are directly related with senescence and the onset of various pathological conditions such as coronary heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Nevertheless, living organisms have developed a complex antioxidant network to counteract reactive species that are detrimental to life. With the aim of bio-prospecting plant species from the Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, we have established a methodology to detect secondary antioxidant metabolites in crude extracts and fractions obtained from plant species. Combining HPLC with an electrochemical detector allowed us to detect micromolecules that showed antioxidant activities in Chimarrhis turbinata (DC) leaf extracts. Comparison with purified flavonoid standards led us to identify the compounds in their natural matrices giving valuable information on their antioxidant capacity. Keywords: antioxidant, HPLC-ElCD, reactive-oxygen-species, flavonoids Introduction Oxygen-derived free radicals such as the superoxide anion radical and hydroxyl radical are thought to be linked to the onset of various pathological conditions such as coronary heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.1-3 Living cells, including those of man, animals and plants, are continuously exposed to a variety of challenges that exert oxidative stress. These could stem from endogenous sources through normal physiological processes such as mitochondrial respiration. Alternatively, they could result from exogenous sources such as exposure to pollutants and ionizing irradiation.4,5 Oxidative stress arises in a biological system after an increased exposure to oxidants, a decrease in the antioxidant capacity of the system, or both. This is often associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including free radicals, which are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases.6-8 Cells are equipped with several defense systems, which act through a variety of mechanisms.9 These can be categorized into protection via enzymatic activities and protection through low-molar mass antioxidants (LMMAs) .10 The LMMA family consist of many compounds, which act as a direct chemical scavengers neutralizing ROS components or indirectly through transition metal chelation.11 LMMAs are small molecules that frequently infiltrate cells, accumulate in specific compartments associated with oxidative damage and then are regenerated by the cell. In human tissues, cellular LMMAs are obtained from various sources. Glutathione (GSH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form), and carnosine12 are synthesized by the cells; uric acid13 and bilirubin14 are 772 Castro-Gamboa et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. waste products of cellular metabolism, and ascorbic acid, tocopherols and polyphenols are antioxidants obtained from the diet.15 Flavonoids and phenolic acids are ubiquitous bioactive compounds found in plant tissues.16 They can be arranged in several structural classes including anthocyanins, flavones, flavan-3-ols (catechins), flavonols and tannins. These micromolecules share the same basic structure consisting of two aromatic rings joined in a chroman structure by a three-carbon unit: C6-C3-C6. Phenolic acids in plant foods and beverages comprise mainly derivatives of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids.17 The diversity in structure and reactivity among different flavonoids and phenolic acids are mainly due to variations in the patterns of oxy-substituents on their aromatic rings.18 Both flavonoids and phenolic acids are closely associated with the sensory attributes of fresh and processed plant foods. However, increasing attention has been given to these classes because of their potential antioxidant activity that may exert cardioprotective effects in humans.19 Thus, it was shown that intake of flavonoids, especially quercetin found in onions, tea and apples, was inversely related to coronary heart disease mortality. Further, it has been suggested that the high amount of flavonoids and phenolic compounds consumed in red wine may explain the reduced coronary heart disease mortality in certain regions of France.20, 21 Evidence has shown that oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leads to atherogenic reactions, and hence increases coronary heart disease mortality.22, 23 Antioxidants that inhibit LDL oxidation may thus reduce atherogenesis. Currently, there is no direct evidence that flavonoids and phenolic acids reduce LDL oxidation in vivo but several studies have shown that these phenolic compounds have the capacity to reduce LDL oxidation in vitro: micromolar concentrations of phenolic compounds in wine and grape juice were thus demonstrated to inhibit oxidation of human LDL in vitro.24 Several methods for measuring the total antioxidant capacity of biological samples, including blood plasma, body fluids and plant extracts, have been proposed and reviewed.25-28 These are related to the capacity of a sample to compete for and scavenge a specific ROS. They provide useful information, which is thought sufficient for the evaluation of the overall antioxidant profile of the biological fluid, tissue homogenate, or plant extract. Recently, electrochemical detection (ElCD) has given good results for the detection of molecules with antioxidant properties,29, 30 based on their electrochemical behavior. Their on-line determination has been successfully achieved through use of an ElCD, which is widely used as a coupled detector in HPLC separations. With the aim of bio-prospecting plant species from the Brazilian Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and Amazon regions, we have established a methodology to detect antioxidant molecules based on HPLC-ElCD. To select the lead plant extracts, we did a prior screening using the bleaching of β-carotene-TLC autographic assay31 and also cyclic voltammetry32 for detecting any electrochemical activity. One of the species selected in this screening was Chimarrhis turbinata (DC) (Rubiaceae). This plant is widely spread from Central America and the Caribbean through tropical South America, mostly concentrated in the Amazon region. Their light and resistant wood is used for crafting tools as oars, this usage being related to the etymology of its popular name: “pau-de- remo”. Rubiaceae species are well known for their biological activities and medicinal uses, bearing metabolites such as flavonoids and indole alkaloids, both chemotypes known to have potential biological activities. The latter are considered taxonomical markers of the Cinchonoideae sub-family within Rubiaceae.33-35 Experimental Instrumental The analytical methodology was developed using a VARIAN STAR 9090 ElCD (Rotterdam, Holland) composed of a glassy carbon working electrode, an Ag/ AgCl reference electrode and an in situ Ag/AgCl electrode. As a complementary detector a VARIAN PROSTAR 310 UV/Vis detector (Walnut Creek, CA, USA) set at 270 nm was used. A Rheodyne injector (Coxati, CA), with a 20 µL loop and a VARIAN 210 HPLC pump as solvent delivery module were used. The determination of the optimal potential to evaluate the crude extracts was obtained through a hydrodynamic voltammogram. Separation of the analytes was carried on a Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA), ODS LUNA; 5 µ column (250 x 4.60 mm). The separation did not require a buffer solution, but was greatly improved by the use of acetic acid (Merck, Poole, UK) (0.05% v/v). The isocratic phase was prepared by mixing acetonitrile 15% v/v; (HPLC grade, Mallinckrodt, Paris, KY, USA) with ultra pure water 85% v/v, obtained by passing redistilled water through a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Watford, UK). All the separations were carried out at 30 °C a temperature achieved through an oven coupled to the ElCD. The extract from Chimarrhis turbinata (DC) leaves was obtained through three distinct macerations of the dried and powered material with EtOH:H2O (8:2). All solvents 773 HPLC-ElCD: An Useful Tool for the Pursuit of Novel Analytical Strategies Vol. 14, No. 5, 2003 used for extractions were of analytical grade (Mallinckrodt, Paris, Kentucky, USA). After concentration of the extract using a vacuum rotatory evaporator (Büchi, Falwil, Switzerland), the sample was then submitted to pre- purification using a Sep-Pak (ODS) (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) cartridge with elution using 100% acetonitrile. The resulting filtered sample was injected into the column for the detection of any electrochemically active component. Plant material The leaves from Chimarrhis turbinata (DC) were collected in “Reserva do Viro”, Belém - PA, Brazil in February 2000 and the specimen was identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro. A voucher (number Cord-2367) was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, São Paulo, Brazil. Results and Discussion Prior to the analysis, it was necessary to establish an optimal potential for the analytes. Thus, solutions (100 mgL-1) of catechin (1), rutin (2), chlorogenic acid caffeoyl ester (3) previously isolated and identified from C.turbinata (Figure 1) were prepared. Each standard compound (20 µL) was injected at several working electrode potentials ranging from –2.00 to 2.00 V and chromatograms were recorded at 0.05 V intervals (Figure 2). The UV/Vis detector was set at 270 nm, which was the best wavelength for the absorption of the flavonoids and the C6-C3 derivatives used as standards. From the analyses the optimal working potential was determined to range between 0.80 V and 0.60 V. Thus the analytical conditions for the crude extracts were improved, aiming to enhance chromatographic resolution. Crude extracts from C.turbinata leaves were injected mostly from the ethyl acetate, methanol and aqueous phases. These are known to be rich in flavonoids an other phenolic metabolites that are usually electrochemically active. Initially it was noted that most of the peaks were broad, suggesting a possible keto-enolic equilibrium of the analytes. We thus used a 0.05% (v/v) of acetic acid in water, obtaining great enhancement in the peak profiles as shown in Figure 3. In the search of a better mobile phase methanol was used but with little success when compared with acetonitrile mixtures. In all chromatographic separations the presence of a buffer solution was not required since we obtained a good cell current and a steady base line for the ElCD. The best chromatographic conditions obtained for the crude extracts were mobile phase water:acetonitrile; 85:15 v/v, flow rate: 0.80 mL/min; 0% offset, digital filter set at 0.1 s, range 5 mA and an oven temperature of 30 °C. The identification of peaks was based on comparison of Figure 1. Chromatogram of a mixture of rutin, catechin and chlorogenic acid, isolated from C.turbinata using ElCD.

Conclusions The proposed screening method using HPLC-ElCD is useful for the detection of antioxidants because of its high sensitivity and ease handling. The method may be advantageous for the sensitive determination of antioxidants in complex matrices.

In the analysis of C. turbinata extracts the absence of a buffer solution to stabilize the base line of the electrochemical detector is an important factor, which certainly saves time in the preparation and maintenance of the HPLC and the electrochemical cell. An interesting application of this method is the selection of plant extracts containing LMMA antioxidant molecules for further phytochemical studies and biological evaluation regarding anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral and other activities, as redox processes are involved in the etiology of a number of pathologies.

Keywords: Nectandra grandiflora, Lauraceae, neolignan, flavonoid, radical scavenging activity, antioxidant Introduction Nectandra grandiflora Nees is a tree belonging to Lauraceae family, which is known for economically important species such as Aniba roseodora (“pau-rosa”), the main source of sesquiterpene (linalool)-rich essential oil used in perfumery; and species with scented leaves and bark such as Laurus nobilis (bay leaves) and Ocotea odorifera (Brazilian cinnamon), widely used as condiments.1-3 Lignans and neolignans are important classes of secondary metabolites occurring in Lauraceae species, which include several medicinally important closely related compounds as the anti-mitotic podophyllotoxin, extracted from Podophyllum peltatum (Berberidaceae), used in the preparation of the antitumoral lignans etoposide and teniposide, and the antioxidant nor- dihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), obtained from Larrea tridentata (Zygophyllaceae).4 Nectandra species are extensively used in folk medicine due to their antirrheumatic, digestive and diuretic properties.5 Some of the claimed medicinal properties have been substantiated by studies, e.g. on Nectandra salicifolia, which showed antifungal and vascular muscle relaxing properties,6 in addition to antimalarial activity due to the presence of the alkaloid costaricin in its bark extract.7 Previous work on N. grandiflora evidenced the presence of aporphine alkaloids and antitumoral activity in its bark extract.8 A number of pathologies are known to be ultimately associated with the imbalance of pro and antioxidant factors in living systems. Exogenous antioxidant compounds may therefore exert beneficial actions upon 527 A New Neolignan and Antioxidant Phenols from Nectandra grandiflora Vol. 16, No. 3B, 2005 systems which have been deprived from sufficient amounts of endogenous antioxidants as in some cardiovascular diseases, tumors, inflammation, ulcer and aging.9 As part of our ongoing projects aiming the phytochemical investigation of São Paulo State flora,10-12 the EtOH crude extract from leaves of N. grandiflora collected at Jureia State Park, Atlantic Forest, have been subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation using the β-carotene test on TLC for the detection of antioxidant compounds.13 Pure compounds isolated from this extract were further evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity towards the stable free radical DPPH and compared to standard compounds rutin and BHT.11,14 Non-active fractions were also investigated and afforded the benzofuran neolignan burchellin and two bicyclooctane[3.2.1] neolignans: piperol B and the new 2’-oxo-piperol B. Results and Discussion The EtOH crude extract of N. grandiflora leaves was successively partitioned with organic solvents affording hexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and MeOH extracts. The TLC test using β-carotene as revealing agent indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the EtOAc and MeOH fractions. Chromatographic fractionation of these extracts led to the isolation of protocatechuic acid (6) and flavonol glycosides afzelin (4) and quercetrin (5), which were identified through analyses of their MS and NMR spectra and comparison with literature data.15,16 Fractionation of the CHCl3 extract led to the isolation of neolignans 1-3. Compound 1 was obtained as a light brown viscous oil and its 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals for sp2 carbons and 9 signals for sp3 carbons, including three signals at ca. δ 56, assigned to three methoxy groups on sp2 carbons (Table 1). These data combined with HRMS analysis in the positive ion mode [(C21H24O5, (M+1)+• 357; expanded to C18H15O2.(OCH3)3] suggested compound 1 is a bicarbonyl neolignan, with 13C NMR signals for C=O groups at δ 190.5 and δ 203.0. The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed three broad doublets at δ 2.48, δ 5.08 and δ 5.14, and one multiplet at δ 5.89 assigned to hydrogens of an allyl moiety. Additionally, a doublet at δ 0.99 (3 H-9) and a quintuplet at δ 2.08 (H-8) indicated compound 1 is a guianin type bicyclooctane neolignan.17,18 The absence of a doublet at ca. δ 5.90 for an oxybenzylic hydrogen of the related benzofuran type neolignans, gave additional support to this proposal. Its relative stereochemistry was deduced from the absence of anisotropy from the aromatic ring on the deshielded H-9 (δ 0.99) evidencing a trans relationship between methyl group C-9 and the aromatic ring.17,18 Table 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. Moreover, the bicycle bridge associated with the guianin type configuration of 1 is evidenced by the absorption of H- 6’ at δ 5.72. Further analysis of NMR spectra and comparison with literature data for other guianin-type compounds suggested the presence of an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and an additional carbonyl (C-2’, ν 1760 cm-1) in the bicyclic moiety.17,18 HMQC correlations allowed the complete assignment of hydrogen signals to carbons; and HMBC correlations of C-2’ to H-7, H-3’ and H-7’; and C-4’ to H-7 and H-3’ supported the position of carbonyl groups at C-2’ and C-4’ in the bicyclic moiety, respectively (Figure 1). This spectrum also showed correlations of C-5’ to H-3’; C-7’ to H-6’; and C-1 to H-7, H-8 and H-3’, which supported the position of one methoxyl at C-5’, the allyl group at C-1’ and aromatic ring at C-7. Additional cross-peaks in the HMBC spectrum gave support to the proposed structure for compound 1 (Figure 1). ESI(+)-MS/MS experiments for the protonated molecule of m/z 357 with dissociation induced by collisions with argon provides further structural characterization as dissociation forms major ionic fragments of m/z 316 (24), 341 (8), and 301 (22) owing to the losses of an allyl, methyl and allyl plus methyl radicals, in addition to a fragment ion of m/z 151 (9), assigned to the dimethoxytropilium ion. Additionally, the protonated 1, of m/z 357, dissociates by the loss of a neutral molecule of 1,2-dimethoxybenzene to yield the ion of m/z 219 (Figure 2), which likely rearranges to form an acylium ion that subsequently loses a neutral C3H4 allene to yield an ion of m/z 179. Additional data from a LRMS experiment showed the base peak of m/z 179 and peaks at 357, 325, 316 and 219 (see Experimental section), which gave support to the structure proposed for compound 1. These data are fully consistent with the new bicyclooctane neolignan 1, which is therefore assigned as (7S*, 8R*, 1’R*, 3’R*)-3,4,5’-trimethoxy-3,7’-cyclo-8,1’-neolig-8’-ene- 2,4’(3’H)-dione. Compound 2 was identified as the bicycle [3.2.1]octane neolignan piperol B and compound 3, as the benzofuran neolignan burchellin, previously isolated from Piper betle and Aniba burchelli, respectively.19,20 Compound 2 is a guianin type and compound 3 is a porosin type neolignan and their identification was based on extensive analyses of NMR data as well as on comparison with literature data for guianin, porosin and ferrearin type neolignans, which are widely distributed in Lauraceae species.21 The antiradicalar activity of compounds 1-6 has been evaluated towards the stable free radical DPPH, which exhibits an absorption maximum at 517 nm, evidencing prominent activities of compounds 4-6 (Figure 3) and poor activities for compounds 1-3. The absence of phenolic hydroxyls in the latter renders them less effective in promoting DPPH reduction, therefore appearing as poor radical scavengers. The free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids and other phenols is mostly due to their aromatic hydroxy groups, which confer great stability to the phenolic radical as soon it is formed, after one hydrogen radical donation to DPPH. The stronger activity of compound 5 when compared to compounds 4 and 6 is probably due to the catechol moiety in the B ring of quercetrin along with its extended conjugation through the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system on the C ring, which are some of the major structural features associated with antioxidant activity of flavonoids.22 The comparison with standard compound rutin (∆A=81% at 50 µmol L-1) evidences the reported major roles of some structural Figure 3.

HPLC separations were performed on a Waters Prep LC 4000 System and C-18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns (4.6 mm and 20mm i.d. for analytical and preparative columns, respectively) and pre-columns were used. All solvents (Merck or Malinckrodt) were of analytical or HPLC grade. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. Low resolution ESI(+)-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. High resolution ESI(+)-MS analysis were performed on a hybrid double quadrupole (Qq) and orthogonal time-of-flight (Tof) mass spectrometer (Qtof, Micromass UK) operating at 7.000 resolution and mass accuracy of 10 ppm. The temperature of the nebulizer was 50 °C. The ESI and mass spectrometer were operated in the positive ion mode. The cone and extractor potential were set to 40 and 0 V, respectively. The m/z scan range was from 50 up to 1000. Tandem mass spectrometric [ESI(+)- MS/MS] experiments were performed using the product ion scan mode via Q1 mass selection of the desirable product ion, q2 collision-induced dissociation (CID) with N2, and orthogonal TOF mass analysis of the CID ionic fragments. The collision energy ranged from 15 to 25 eV, depending on the dissociation lability of the precursor ion. Plant material Nectandra grandiflora leaves were collected in Jureia- Itatins State Park, Atlantic Forest, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Ines Cordeiro. The voucher specimens (number: Moraes 05) were deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Botânica- SEMA, SP, Brazil. Extraction and isolation Dried and ground leaves (2.0 kg) were extracted with ethanol at r.t. and afforded a dark green EtOH extract (5.0 g) after solvent evaporation under vacuum. Partition of the EtOH extract with organic solvents gave the hexane (0.6g), CHCl3 (1.6 g), EtOAc (0.5 g) and hydroalcoholic (2.3 g) extracts after solvent evaporation. MPLC on silica gel of the CHCl3 extract (1.6 g, hexane/EtOAc gradient) gave 15 pooled fractions (A1-A15). Fraction A2 (41.0 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/acetone/HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound 2 (12.2 mg). Fraction A3 (32.1 mg), obtained from the elution with hexane/EtOAc 4:1, was further purified by preparative TLC (CHCl3/acetone/ HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound 1 (6.8 mg). Fraction A6 (88.1 mg) was recrystallized in MeOH to afford compound 3 (25.5 mg). CC on Sephadex LH-20 of the EtOAc fraction (200.0 mg) eluted with MeOH resulted in 42 subfractions which were pooled after TLC analysis (B1- B4). Fr. B2 (38.7 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/HOAc 79:18:2:1) and gave compound 4 (7.1 mg). Purification of fraction B3 (45.1 mg) by preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 36:12:1:1) afforded compound 5 (14.0 mg). The hydroalcoholic fraction (200.0 mg) was submitted to CC on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH resulting in 10 fractions (C1- C10). Purification of fraction C-8 (37.7 mg) by RP-HPLC (C18 Luna-Phenomenex column, MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 55:43:2, 8 mL min-1, detection at 280 nm) gave compound 6 (8.1 mg). Bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates Samples were eluted on TLC plates which were then dried and sprayed with 0.02% solution of β-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates are placed under natural light until discoloration of background. The remaining yellow spots indicate the presence of antioxidants.13 Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) The free radical scavenging capacities of the isolates and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated from their ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 µmol L-1 to 100 µmol L-1were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated as ∆A= (Ao-A)/Ao.11, 14 (7S*,8R*,1’R*,3’R*)-3,4,5’-trimethoxy-3,7’-cyclo- 8,1’-neolig-8’-ene-2,4’(3’H)-dione (1).

O mutualismo entre o fungo e as formigas é um ponto a ser explorado quando se considera sua possível aplicação em métodos alternativos para o controle desses insetos. Sabendo- se que algumas plantas são naturalmente resistentes aos insetos fitófagos, alguns produtos naturais (metabólitos secundários) devem ser avaliados em relação às suas propriedades inseticidas e/ou fungicidas. Neste trabalho foram isoladas oito cumarinas de quatro espécies de plantas e o efeito no desenvolvimento do fungo simbionte das formigas cortadeiras Atta sexdens foi determinado. Com exceção da clausarina, todas as outras cumarinas foram inibitórias de 64 µg mL-1 à 80 µg mL-1 sendo que a xantiletina inibiu o fungo na concentração de 25 µg mL-1. Leaf-cutting ants are known to be a serious pest for agriculture due to the high amounts of vegetal matter from crops used by them in order to cultivate a symbiotic fungus on which they rely for food and enzymes. The mutualism between the fungus and the ants is a point to be explored when alternative methods of control are being thought of. Considering that some plants are naturally resistant to phytophagous insects, some natural products (secondary metabolites) should be evaluated with respect to their insecticide and/or fungicide properties. In this paper we isolated eight coumarins from four different plant species and we determined their effect on the development of the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens. With the exception of clausarin, all the other coumarins were inhibitory from 64 µg mL-1 through 80 µg mL-1 and xanthyletin inhibited the fungus at 25 µg mL-1 Keywords: leaf-cutting ants, coumarins, symbiotic fungus inhibition Introduction Leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores in the tropics, can be found from the Southern United States to Northern Argentina.1 They cultivate a symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, thus damaging agriculture.2 It is known that plants have several mechanisms to avoid herbivores, including a set of toxic chemicals.3 The presence of secondary plant metabolites toxic to the ants and/or to their symbiotic fungi may play an important role in whether the ants will cut such plants or not.4 Many of the most important crops cultivated in our country are exotic species, which have not had the possibility of co-evolution with predators and as such are preferentially attacked.5 Different methods have been proposed for the control of these ants (organophosporus, pyrethroids and sulfluramid insecticides). However, problems with non-target animals, high chemical stability and environmental contamination are common and it is necessary to continue looking for new strategies to control these insects.6 The search for specific compounds directed against these ants and their microbial partners has been the focus of our studies during the past years and natural chemicals isolated from a variety of plant species were effective against the ants and inhibited the growth of their symbiotic fungus or both.6-15 Among the several biological properties of coumarins we can find dermal photosensitising, estrogenic, antimicrobial, vasodilator, molluscicidal, antihelmintic, 670 Godoy et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. sedative and hypnotic, analgesic and hypothermic activities,16,17 but they have been associated mainly with anticoagulant activity.18 Indeed, they are widely found in several botanical families such as Rutaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Moraceae and Thymeleaceae and it seems to correlate with their action as phytoalexins. Repellent action to beetles and other terrestrial invertebrates and the inhibition of both sporulation and the growth of some fungal plant pathogens by some coumarins were described by Weinmann.19 The aim of this study was to analyze the activity of eight coumarins isolated from different plant species on the development of the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Experimental Preparation and fractioning of crude extracts Different parts of plants were ground to powder, dried at 40 °C and percolated with a set of organic solvents (hexane, dichloromethane and methanol) during 72 hours three times each at room temperature for three days, followed by the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure at 40 °C. The crude extracts were fractionated through flash chromatography under vacuum with silica gel and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol). They were then purified through different techniques including column chromatography, preparative TLC and HPLC. Coumarins Angelicin (1), suberosin (2), xanthoxyletin (3) and clausarin (4) were isolated from the methanol extract of the roots of Citrus limonia. Isopimpinellin (5) was isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the roots of Adiscanthus fusciflorus Ducke. Umbelliferone (6) was isolated from the hydroalcoholic extract of the barks of Picramnia teapensis, xanthyletin (7) and 7-hydroxy-3- (1´1´-dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (8) were isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the stems of Pilocarpus riedelianus. All the coumarins were identified through spectrometric techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS and IR and compared to literature data for (1); 20 (2); 21-23 (3);22, 24 (4); 22 (5); 22, 23, 25-27 (6); 28 (7); 28, 29 (8).30 Fungus The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Singer) Möller (syn Rozites gongylophorus) was isolated from a laboratory nest of Atta sexdens L. The medium for fungus maintenance and methods for the bioassays were previously described.10 One mL of dichloromethane solution of each coumarin was added to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose, 10.0; sodium chloride, 5.0; peptone, 5.0; malt extract, 10.0 and agar, 15.0. Control tubes received 1.0 mL of dichloromethane and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes were autoclaved at 121 oC by 15 min and then slanted. The final concentration of each coumarin in µg mL-1 was: 1=72; 2=64; 3= 70; 4=75; 5=80; 6=65; 7=25 and 8=75. The fungal suspension was prepared by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1 g L–1) and gently fragmented. One mL of this suspension was spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at 25(±1) oC for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two sets of five tubes each). Controls with and without solvent as well as with PBO (9) (commercial piperonil butoxide – Pirisa Piretro Industrial, 97LO106IO) were run simultaneously. Fungal growth was estimated macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and density using the modal value. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of the isolated coumarins and on Table 1 we can see the effects of the coumarins on the fungal growth. Except for clausarin (4), which had no effect on the fungal development at a concentration of 75 µg mL-1, all the others inhibited the fungus at different degrees. Thus, at 72 µg mL-1, angelicin (1) was responsible for a moderate (40%) inhibition of fungal growth whereas an inhibition of 60% was achieved with umbelliferone (6) at 65 µg mL-1. Strong inhibition (80% at 75 µg mL-1) was observed with 7-hydroxy-3-(1’,1’- dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (8) and total inhibition of fungal growth was observed with suberosin (2), xanthoxyletin (3) and isopimpinellim (5) at concentrations ranging from 64 to 80 µg mL-1. Unfortunately, we did not have enough material to determine whether suberosin, xanthoxyletin and isopimpinellim could be inhibitory at a lower concentration. Victor31 had shown total inhibition of the fungus in the presence of xanthyletin (7) at concentrations of 100 and 50 µg mL-1. The same effect was now observed at 25 µg mL-1 showing that this compound should be better evaluated in respect to its potential in the control of these insects. 671 Inhibition of the Symbiotic Fungus of Leaf-Cutting Ants by Coumarins Vol. 16, No. 3B, 2005 Five out of the eight coumarins assayed were isolated from the roots of Citrus limonia and Adiscanthus fusciflorus. Natural coumarins are synthesized by plants as a response to injury during the wilting process, diseases or drying and accumulate on the surface of leaves, fruits and seeds. According to Ojala32 their presence in the roots may provide a tool against microbial invasion. Attempts to correlate structure and antimicrobial activity of coumarins were made by some authors. Kayser and Kolodziej33 reported that highly oxygenated coumarins and the positions of the polar hydroxyls and of the less polar methoxy groups on the aromatic nucleus are important for antibacterial activity. Yet, according to Dini et al. (apud Sardari et al.34) the occurrence of the aromatic hydroxy group and/or ether or ester groups at positions 6 or 7 of the basic structure are important for antifungal action. For them, alkylated derivatives of 7- hydroxycoumarins can have both antifungal and antibacterial properties. On the other hand, Sardari et al.34 did not find antifungal activity of coumarins with a hydroxy group at position 7, as observed with umbelliferone, which showed low activity against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus niger but they found a relationship between antifungal activity and the presence of free 6–OH and 6–OMe. The results of Sardari et al.34 were confirmed by Ojala et al.35 with C. albicans, A. niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae but not for the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium culmorum to which umbelliferone was highly inhibitory. So, if some structure-activity relationship can be made, the hypothesis about a possible species-specific activity cannot be discarded. Except for clausarin (4) our results showed that the seven linear coumarins assayed inhibited the symbiotic fungus of A. sexdens at low concentrations whereas a low inhibition was achieved with angelicin. Since angelicin was the only angular coumarin assayed in this work it was not possible to establish at this moment any relationship between antifungal activity and linearity. Also the occurrence of prenyl and MeO groups linked to the basic structure of coumarins should be better studied in order to determine if they are important or not for the antifungal activity described here.

Cardoso, Dulce H. S. Silva, Ian Castro-Gamboa and Vanderlan da S. Bolzani* Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista CP 355, 14800-900 Araraquara-SP, Brazil Um novo biflavonol denominado chimarrosídeo (1) e oito flavonóis glicosilados adicionais (2-9) foram isolados das folhas de Chimarrhis turbinata. Suas estruturas foram elucidadas com base nos dados dos experimentos de RMN 1D e 2D, como: 3-O-rutinosilquercetina (2), 3-O- rutinosil-kaempferol (3), 3-O-galactopiranosil-(6→1)-ramnopiranosil kaempferol (4), 3-O-β- galactopiranosil-(6→1)-α-ramnopiranosil-quercetina (5), 6-hidroxirutina (6), 3-O- galactopiranosil-kaempferol (7), 3-O-glucopiranosil-kaempferol (8) e 3-O-ramnopiranosil- (6→1)-glucopiranosil-(4→1)-ramnopiranosil-kaempferol (9). Adicionalmente, a catequina (10) e a procianidina B-3 (catequina-(4α→8)-catequina) (11) também foram isoladas. O extrato bruto, frações e compostos isolados foram avaliados quanto às suas propriedades antioxidantes no teste em CCD aspergida com solução de β-caroteno, e teste espectrofotométrico utilizando o radical livre 1,1-difenil-2-picrilidrazila (DPPH). Os flavonóides 2, 5, 6, 10 e 11 apresentaram forte atividade antioxidante quando comparados com os padrões BHT e rutina. A new biflavonol, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonol glycosides (2-9), were isolated from the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata. Their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (4), quercetin-3-O- α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (5), 6-hydroxy-rutin (6), kaempferol-3- O-D-galactopyranoside (7), kaempferol-3-O-D-glucopyranoside (8) and kaempferol-3-O-α-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranoside (9). In addition, catechin (10) and catechin-(4α→8)-catechin-procyanidin B-3) (11) were isolated. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative properties using an autographic assay based on β-carotene bleaching on TLC plates, and spectrophotometric detection by reduction of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Flavonoids 2, 5, 6, 10 and 11 displayed strong free radical scavenging activity, when compared with the standards BHT and rutin. Keywords: Rubiaceae, chimarrhoside, DPPH, β-carotene Introduction In recent years, flavonoids have been widely recognized as a major class of secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties due to their ability to scavenge free radicals.1-3 Antioxidant is a broad classification for molecules that may act prior to, or during, a free radical chain reaction at initiation, propagation, termination, decomposition, or subsequent reaction of oxidation products as sensitive targets.4 There are several diseases, whose causes and severity are linked to oxidation, mainly those associated with oxygen free radicals, which have been implicated as mediators of degenerative and chronic deteriorative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases,5 such as rheumatoid arthritis,6 diabetes, vascular disease and hypertension, cancer and hyperplasic diseases,7 cataract formation and aging processes.8 Radical-mediated pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion, asthma and many others involving an imbalance in pro-oxidant- antioxidant processes.9 In our search for antioxidant compounds from Amazonian plant species, we examined constituents of Chimarrhis turbinata DC Rodr.. (Rubiaceae) leaves, collected in the city of Belém, Pará State, Brazil. The chemical composition of C. turbinata has been studied previously, and bioactive indole alkaloids were identified.10-12 In this paper, we describe the isolation 1354 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. of a new biflavonoid, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant effects, which were deduced by electrochemical detection coupled to an HPLC system, bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates, and parameters related to the evaluation of antioxidant activity measured by free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl). Results and Discussion Chimarrhoside (1) was obtained as an amorphous pale yellow powder from the EtOH extract and exhibited in its mass spectrum a molecular ion peak at m/z 1171 [M+H]+ obtained from ESIMS. The IR and UV spectra of 1 revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (270, 295, 344 nm, 1690 cm-1). Part of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of compound 1 were observed in duplicate, suggesting a dimer (Table 1). Comparison of the 13C NMR values of 1 with literature data13 evidenced the kaempferol aglycone and additional similar spectral features to those of 3, also isolated in this work, except for the duplication of some signals for carbons arising from a dimer structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 1, signals for two kaempferol units as two meta-coupled A-ring hydrogens (H-6/H-8) and two pairs of coupled B-ring hydrogens (H-3'/H-5' and H-2'/H-6') for each aglycone were observed, in addition to four anomeric hydrogens at δ 5.12 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 5.02 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 4.40 (1H, br s), 4.60 (1H, br s), 20 hydroxymethine and 2 hydroxymethylene hydrogens. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of two kaempferol moieties and 24 hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene signals which, analyzed together with 1H NMR data (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of two diglycoside moieties identified as rutinosyl and α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- (1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. This assumption was supported by signals at δ 103.1 / 67.1 and δ 104.0 / 65.9, assigned to C-1'’ C-6'’ of the glucopyranosyl and of the galactopyranosyl moiety respectively. Those signals also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’ (anomeric) and H-6'’ (Table 1); as well as signals at δ 100.9/16.4 and δ 100.4/16.6, assigned to C-1’’’/C-6’’’ of the two rhamnopyranosil moieties, respectively, which also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’’ (δ 4.4 0 and 4.60) and H-6’’’ (δ 1.17 and 1.11). On the basis of the above data, the chemical shifts assigned for each sugar: the glucosyl and galactosyl moieties were confirmed taking into account the values at δ 103.1, 76.6, 75.7, 74.3, 70.1 and 67.1 as well as δ 104.0, 73.9, 73.6, 71.5, 68.2 and 65.9 attributed to glucose and galactose, respectively.15 According to literature data, using the same solvent, the chemical shifts of hydroxymethines carbons in glucose are quite deshielded when compared to those of galactose. The glucosyl/galactosyl groups are linked to the rhamnosyl residue at C-6”, because the signal assigned to this carbon, in both sugar moieties, was markedly displaced downfield at δ 67.1/65.9 (∆δ +6), respectively when compared with the 13C NMR spectrum of free hydroxymethylenes in glucose/galactose. This also was confirmed by the observation of a HMBC long-range correlation of the anomeric hydrogen signal of the rhamnosyl group at δ 4.40 / 4.60 with C-6” of the glucosyl moieties at 67.1 and 65.9, respectively. Additionally, the site of glycosylation at C-3 of each kaempferol moiety was evidenced from downfield shifts of C-2 (∆δ +9) and C-4 (∆δ +2) and upfield shift of C-3 (∆δ -3) when compared to the aglycone,15 as well as from HMBC correlations of H-1'’ to C-3a/3b within each kaempferol diglycoside moiety (Figure 1). Further HMBC correlations of H-6 and H-8 with C-7 (δ 164.6) confirmed the assignments for ring A and suggested the interflavonoidic linkage at C-7 due to the observed downfield shift of its signal when compared to the monomer.15 Moreover, ESIMS analysis showed peaks of m/z 298 (70) and 133 (40) resulting from Retro Diels- Alder (RDA) fragmentations. From moiety A wherein bonds 1 and 3 undergo scission, lead to formation of ions I and II as well as scission of bonds 0 and 2 led to the formation of fragment m/z 433 (30). The fragment m/z 298 (70), was generated by both RDA suffered by moiety A and moiety B (Figure 2). Additional fragments observed in the mass spectra are in accordance with those reported for kaempferol.16 These data, combined with HPLC analysis, which showed a lower retention time for compound 1 (5.7 min) when compared to monomeric flavonol diglycosides 2 (9.8 min) and 3 (13.8 min.) (Figure 3), confirmed the proposed structure for compound 1 as kaempferol 3-O-β-rutinosyl-(7α→O→7β)-kaempferol-3- O-β-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. Further studies of the EtOAc extract from leaves of C. turbinata resulted in 10 known flavonoids already reported in the literature: Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol- 3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamno- Figure 1.

These compounds were identified and their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments and compared with literature data (Figure 4).13-15, 18, 19-22, 26-28 The radical scavenging effects obtained for compounds 2-11 assayed with DPPH are shown in (Table 2) using as reference the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 21.34 μg mL-1) and BHT (IC50 62.50 μg mL-1). These results indicate that the free-radical scavenging activity of these 1356 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. micromolecules is due to its hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the ease of stabilization of the phenoxyl radical after reduction of DPPH and is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by the IC50 values for compounds 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11.24 It is also evident from Table 2, that ortho-dihydroxy moiety plays more important role for this type of activity than the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, as the lack of the latter, e.g. in compound 10, contributed in a lesser extent to the loss of activity, as observed for compounds 3, 4 and 7-9, due to the missing catechol group.

Experimental General experimental procedures Commercial β-carotene (Aldrich) and DPPH (Aldrich) were used in the antioxidant assays. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C and referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance (CD3OD at δ 3.33 and 49.0 for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR-Nicolet, model EMACT-40 Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer, in the range 500-4000 cm-1. ESIMS spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10-20 eV with argon. Silica gel 60H (230-400 μ), (60-230 μ) (Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) and XAD-16 (Sigma) were used in column chromatography. TLC plates were illuminated under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. For preparative HPLC, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, ODS Phenomenex,, Luna column (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 μm), and pre-Column (50 x 10.00 mm) were used in this study. For semi-preparative HPLC, a Supelco ODS column 8 (250 mm x 10 mm x 5 μm) was used. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All EIMS spectra were obtained by direct insertion of the samples, using an electric cone potential of +70 eV. Plant material Leaves from C. turbinata DC Rodr. were collected at the Viro Reserve, in the State of Pará, in October 1996 and February 2000. Dr. Inês Cordeiro identified the specimen, and a voucher No. Cord-2367 was deposited in the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanic Garden, São Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation C. turbinata were collected twice, and the plant material obtained (1.0 kg), were dried, powdered and extracted with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) and EtOH, successively, affording extracts A and B, respectively, after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. Extract B was dissolved in MeOH:H2O (80:20) and partitioned with hexane. The hydroalcoholic fraction was partially evaporated to MeOH:H2O (60:40), and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. All fractions were preliminarily screened with β-carotene solution on TLC for antioxidant compounds. The EtOAc fraction (1.0 g after solvent evaporation) was dissolved in MeOH (5.0 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-1 to A-12. Fraction A-5 (160.0 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with MeOH and the obtained subfractions were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-5-I, A-5-II and A-5-III. Fraction A-5-II was purified by HPLC [Phenomenex ODS, 250 x 21.2 mm, 10 μm; eluent: MeOH-H2O (2:3, v/v); 12.0 mL min-1; UV detection at 280 nm] affording compounds 2 (7.0 mg), 3 (16.0 mg) and 4 (12.0 mg). Fraction A-6 (63.1 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over9 Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-6-I, A-6-II and A-6-III. Fraction A-6-I (25.0 mg) was purified by LC over polivinylpirrolidone (PVPP)25 eluted with MeOH affording the new compound 1 (2.6 mg). Leaves of C. turbinata (powdered and air-dried material 1.2 kg) obtained from the second collection were extracted exhaustively with EtOH at room temperature. The EtOH solutions were evaporated under vacuum to give a residue (57.1 g). This residue was dissolved in EtOH:H2O (90:10), and then extracted with n-hexane to give a n-hexane fraction (28.9 g). The EtOH:H2O fraction was extracted with CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH successively, to give a CH2Cl2 fraction (4.0 g), EtOAc fraction (4.1 g), n-BuOH fraction (12.4 g) and H2O-soluble residues (7.6 g), respectively, which were screened by β-carotene test on TLC.

O padrão de incorporação de glicose-[1-13C] em 1 foi determinado por experimentos de RMN 13C quantitativos. O padrão de marcação revelou que o precursor foi especificamente incorporado, e que as unidades isoprênicas presentes no 4-nerolidilcatecol são derivadas tanto do ácido mevalônico, quanto da via triose/piruvato. Os resultados também indicaram que tanto a via plastídica quanto citoplasmática são capazes de gerar unidades de difosfato de isopentenila para a biossíntese de 1. The biosynthetic origins of the isoprene units of 4-nerolidylcatechol (1), the major constituent of Potomorphe umbellata, have been studied through feeding experiments with [14C]- and [13C]- glucose, and with precursors of the mevalonic acid and triose/pyruvate pathways, namely, [2-14C]-mevalonolactone and [U-14C]-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, respectively. The pattern of incorporation of label from [1-13C]-glucose into 1 was determined by quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy. The labelling pattern revealed that the additive was specifically incorporated, and that the isoprene units of the sesquiterpenoid moiety of 4-nerolidylcatechol were derived from both the mevalonic acid and the triose/pyruvate pathways. The results indicate that both plastidic and cytoplasmic pathways are able to provide isopentenyl diphosphate units for the biosynthesis of 1. Keywords: Potomorphe umbellata, Piperaceae, 4-nerolidylcatechol, biosynthesis, sesquiterpenoid, isopentenyl diphosphate Introduction The terpenoids represent one of the largest classes of secondary metabolites comprising, together with the steroids, more than 30,000 compounds to date.1 Whilst the terpenoids are known to play important roles in the development and survival of every living organism,2 many compounds of the class have been found to accumulate at high levels in a number of plant species. They possess, as a common building block, the isoprene unit that is formally derived from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Originally, the well-studied mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway was considered to be the unique biosynthetic route to IPP and was believed to operate in all organisms. However, an alternative pathway has been shown to be involved in the formation of the hopane triterpenes in bacteria3 and, more recently, the widespread occurrence of this route within the plant kingdom has been demonstrated.4-8 The reaction sequence of the alternative pathway involves condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate leading to the formation of 1-desoxyxylulose-5-phosphate, the first C5 intermediate. Several subsequent steps, including an intramolecular rearrangement, lead to IPP.4 There is some reason to believe that the triose/pyruvate pathway is compartmentalised in the plastids of plant cells and is involved in the formation of mono-, di-, and tetra- terpenoids, whilst the MVA pathway is located in the cytoplasm and is responsible for the synthesis of sesquiterpenes and sterols.9 However, substantial evidence indicates that this hypothesis of subcellular compartmentation of plant terpenoid biosynthesis may be simplistic as it does not take into account the exchange of plastidic and cytoplasmic metabolites. For example, early 1407 Biosynthetic Origins of the Isoprene Units of 4-Nerolidylcatechol Vol. 16, No. 6B, 2005 studies involving chamomile flowers (Chamomilla recutita) demonstrated an efficient incorporation of label from [1-13C]-glucose into sesquiterpenes, but revealed an heterogeneous labelling pattern in the accumulated farnesyl pyrophosphate. Thus, whilst the two initial isoprene units clearly originated from the triose/pyruvate route, the third unit was derived from both the MVA and the triose/pyruvate pathways.10 The major constituent of leaves and roots of Potomorphe umbellata is the powerful antioxidant, 4-nerolidylcatechol (1).11,12 Currently, no information is available concerning the biosynthesis of either the sesquiterpene or the catechol portion of this type of compound. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to determine the route of formation of the C15 moiety of 1 in leaves of P. umbellate through feeding experiments involving appropriately labelled precursors. Determination of the 13C-enrichment pattern in 1 following the incorporation of label from [1-13C]-glucose revealed that the sesquiterpene portion was derived from both the MVA and the triose/pyruvate pathways. Results and Discussion Labelled, putative precursors of the sesquiterpene portion of 4-nerolidylcatechol (1), namely, [3-14C]-R,S- mevalonolactone and [U-14C]-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, were administrated to the leaves of Potomorphe umbellata, together with [U-14C]-glucose, which is a precursor of both mevalonolactone and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Freshly harvested leaves were incubated, separately, with 2 μCi of each of these precursors for 6, 24, 48 and 72 h, after which time the leaf material was extracted with ethanol and analysed by HPLC. Radiolabel from all precursors was incorporated into 1 (Table 1). Specific and/or non-specific incorporations of ≥ 1% were obtained within 72 h of feeding with [3-14C]-R,S-mevalonolactone and [U-14C]- glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate but, as would be expected, a considerably lower percentage incorporation (0.1 - 0.3%) was attained with [U-14C]- glucose. In order to determine the specificity of incorporation, and hence the possible biosynthetic origin of the isoprenoid moieties, experiments involving the incorporation of [1-13C]-glucose into 4-nerolidylcatechol (1) were carried out. Different patterns of 13C-enrichment in 1 would be expected depending on the pathway followed.10,13,14 Thus, the conversion of [1-13C]-glucose into IPP via the MVA pathway would lead to the incorporation of label at positions 2, 4 and 5 of each isoprene unit. On the other hand, if [1- 13C]-glucose is converted into pyruvate, the resulting C5 units derived from the triose/pyruvate pathway should be labelled at positions 1 and 5 (Figure 1). Whichever of the two pathways is extant, no label should appear at position 3 of any of the isoprene units if [1-13C]-glucose is specifically incorporated into 1. In feeding experiments involving [1-13C]-glucose as a putative precursor, eight young leaves of P. umbellata were fed for 72 h with 100 μL of a 10% solution of [1-13C]- glucose, and then extracted with ethanol. The ethyl acetate soluble portion of the ethanol extract was fractioned by column chromatography over silica gel followed by TLC to afford 4-nerolidylcatechol (1). The 13C NMR spectra of this sample of 1 and of 4-nerolidylcatechol at natural abundance sample were measured in CDCl3 under identical conditions. The relative abundances of 13C at individual carbon atoms were calculated by comparison of the integration values for the peaks in the labelled sample with those in the natural abundance sample. The values were normalised to a reference value of 1.1% for 13C abundance at the carbon with the lowest 13C- enrichment (Table 2). Enhancement of the signals was Table 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. significant and varied in the range 2.9 - 6.9%. Most importantly, no enrichment of the signals at C-3’, C-7’ or C-11’ of 1 was observed indicating that label was not incorporated into position 3 of any of the isoprene units (Figure 1). This demonstrates that the label from [1-13C]- glucose was incorporated specifically into 1, and not via catabolic processes followed by re-incorporation, within the time period of incubation. Furthermore, a significant enrichment of the remaining carbons (C-2, 4-6) was found (relative 13C abundance of 1.5%). This general labelling might be due to complex metabolic turnover of [1-13C]- glucose with following statistical distribution of the carbon atoms in various positions of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism. As shown in Table 2, feeding experiment with [1-13C]- glucose resulted in clear enhancements of the signals at positions 1, 2, 4 and 5 of all of the isoprene units of the nerolidol moiety. Such a pattern of specific incorporation is consistent with the simultaneous operation of the MVA and triose/pyruvate pathways in the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid portion of 4-nerolidylcatechol (1) in P. umbellata, and suggests an exchange of plastidic and cytoplasmic IPP units. These results corroborate previous studies9 that provided evidence of significant differences in the degree of IPP exchange depending on the type and developmental stage of the tissue, thus giving rise to flexible compartmentalisation of terpenoid biosynthesis in plants. Experimental General [3-14C]-R,S-Mevalonolactone (100.5 μCi mL-1) was purchased from Dupont, [U-14C]-glyceraldehyde (50.0 μCi mL-1) and [U-14C]-D-glucose (1000 μCi mL-1) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and [1-13C]-D-glucose (99%) was from Aldrich. All solvents were of reagent grade and redistilled prior to use. HPLC separations were performed on a Waters 991 system equipped with a photodiode array detector and a Supelco LC-18 reverse phase column (250 x 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 μm). The measurement of radioactivity was carried out using a Tri-Carb® model 2100TR liquid scintillation analyser. The 13C NMR spectra of samples at natural abundance and 13C-labelled samples were measured under identical conditions (125 MHz, 26 oC, repetition time 0.955 s, 45o pulse angle) using a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer. Plant material Leaves of Potomorphe umbellata employed in the feeding experiments with 14C-labelled precursors were collected from plants grown under a 16 h day regime in greenhouses at the Institute of Biological Chemistry (WSU) in Pullman, USA. Plants used in experiments involving [1-13C]-glucose were grown under a natural day- night regime in greenhouse at the Institute of Chemistry (UNESP) in Araraquara, Brazil. Administration of [14C]-labelled compounds to leaves of P. umbellata Young leaves of P. umbellata were excised and fed for 6, 24, 48 and 72 h with 100 μL of a solution containing 2 μCi of either [3-14C]-R,S-mevalonolactone, [U-14C]-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or [U-14C]-D- glucose using one leaf for each feeding experiment. The leaf was frozen in liquid nitrogen, dried overnight under vacuum and extracted, with sonication, for 15 min with ethanol (2 x 10 mL). The solvent was evaporated, the residue was resuspended in methanol (1 mg mL-1) and a 10 μL aliquot analysed by HPLC (elution programme – linear gradient of methanol : water from 65:35 to 85:15 in 10 min, followed by isocratic elution with 85:15 for a further 10 min; flow rate - 1 mL min-1; detection - 280 nm). Fractions (1 mL) of the eluate were collected over a 44 min period and submitted to liquid scintillation counting. Table 2.

The leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and extracted, with sonication, for 15 min with ethanol (2 x 25 mL). The solvent was evaporated and the extract (0.52 g) fractioned by partition between ethyl acetate and water. The ethyl acetate fraction (0.20 g) was applied to a column chromatography of silica gel (20.00 g; 230 - 400 mesh; Merck) and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of ethyl acetate (up to 50%) to yield six fractions. The third and fourth fractions were combined, and the resultant residue (0.09 g) chroma- tographed on silica gel GF254 (Merck) TLC layers eluted with hexane:ethyl acetate (7:3) to yield 4-nerolidyl- catechol (1) (0.03 g). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1 obtained from an incorporation experiment with [1-13C]-glucose and reference sample of 1 from field-grown plants were recorded in CDCl3 under identical conditions with a VARIAN 500 spectrometer (relative to CDCl3 at δH 7.24 ppm and δC 77.0 ppm). Evaluation of relative 13C- enrichment was made by calculation from the relative intensities of both spectra as reported for 4-nerolidyl- catechol (1).3 Acknowledgments This work was supported by grants provided by FAPESP (03/11524-9).

O último foi anteriormente isolado dos caules, porém sua configuração relativa não foi resolvida por experimentos de RMN. Este trabalho apresenta a análise de difração de raios-X da epoxi-fraxinelona, descreve o isolamento da fraxinelonona e fraxinelona pela primeira vez em Raulinoa, e a atividade tóxica da primeira sobre formigas cortadeiras (Atta sexdens rubropilosa). Pouca atividade foi observada para o limonóide degradado testado; entretanto, o limonóide ácido limonéxico isolado dos caules, apresentou alta toxicidade contra as formigas cortadeiras, reduzindo consideravelmente a longevidade das mesmas, em comparação com o controle. Phytochemical survey of roots extracts of the South Brazilian endemic plant Raulinoa echinata Cowan, Rutaceae led to the isolation of known degraded limonoids: fraxinellone, fraxinellonone and epoxy-fraxinellone. The latter was previously isolated also from the stems, but the relative configuration could not be solved by NMR experiments. This paper deals with the X-ray diffraction analysis of epoxy-fraxinellone and its toxicity to leaf-cutting ants, describes the isolation of fraxinellonone and fraxinellone for the first time in Raulinoa. Epoxy-fraxinellone showed no toxicity to the leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens rubropilosa). The limonoid limonexic acid, isolated from stems, presented high toxicity to the leaf-cutting ants, diminishing considerably their longevity. Keywords: Raulinoa echinata, degraded limonoids, limonexic acid, Atta sexdens rubropilosa, X-ray structure Introduction Raulinoa is a monospecific genus and the species Raulinoa echinata Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic in the Itajaí Valley, SC, Brazil.1 This endangered perennial woody shrub is characterized by the presence of spines (popularly know as Cutia-de-espinho) and has only been found in a short interval (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks of Itajaí river in an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing a high degree of adaptation to the environment. We have previously reported the isolation and biological activities of some compounds of R. echinata.2 In continuation of our search for compounds and natural products to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants, we have investigated the hexane extracts of roots of R. echinata leading to the isolation of typical rutaceous degraded limonoids: fraxinellone (1), fraxinellonone (2) and new epoxy-fraxinellone (3). The extracts of the stems furnished the known limonin precursor, limonexic acid (4). Leaf-cutting ants are one of the most serious agricultural pests in South American countries and the biological control of these insects has been the aim of many studies. Their control can be achieved by means of intoxicating the leaf-cutting ants3 or inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus. In this paper we describe the isolation, structural determination and evaluation of the activity of degraded 1444 Biavatti et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. limonoids and limonoids as toxicants to the leaf-cutting ants Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Experimental General experimental procedures NMR spectra: a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C was used.2 All spectra were run in CDCl3 using TMS as internal standard. Single crystal X-ray analysis Low temperature X-ray diffraction data collection was performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 52.7° in 2θ, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;4 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.5 No absorption corrections were applied. The structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.6 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.7 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. Data collections and experimental details for the complexes are summarized in Table 1. The programs SHELXL-97,7 and ORTEP-38 were used within WinGX9 to prepare materials for publication. Data collections and experimental details for compound 3 are summarized in Table 1. Plant material Roots of R. echinata were collected in Ressacada, Ibirama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade de São Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited at the Herbário Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of compounds The dried and powdered roots (397 g) were extracted with hexane (4 g) and MeOH (20 g). Successively, the hexane extract was fractionated over silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) into three fractions: hexane, EtOAc and MeOH. The hexane sub-fraction (576 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (9:1 and gradient) to furnish the compounds (in eluting order): fraxinellone (1) (37.1 mg), epoxy-fraxinellone (3) (76 mg), and the fraction named E (30 mg), that was rechromatographed over silica gel (230-400 mesh) using as eluent CH2Cl2-EtOAc (99:1 and gradient) to afford fraxinellonone (2) (6 mg). The methanol extract of the stems (80 g) was partitioned with dichloromethane (yielding 9 g) then chromatographed over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using as eluent hexane-acetone (9:1 and gradient), furnishing 17 sub-fractions (A-P). Sub- fractions D-G (4.1 g) were grouped and chromatographed over silica gel and hexane-acetone (9:1 and gradient) as eluent, originating sub-fractions A-T. The sub-fraction T (1.2 g) was purified by preparative TLC using hexane- benzene (1:1), yielding 650 mg of limonexic acid (4). Identification of the isolated compounds The isolated degraded limonoids fraxinellone10,11,12 (1), fraxinellonone10,11,12 (2), epoxy-fraxinellone13 (3) and limonexic acid13 (4) presented spectral data in agreement with the literature. epoxy-fraxinellone (3). 5-Furan-3-yl-1a,4a-dimethyl- hexahydro-1,6-dioxa-cyclopropa[d]inden-7-one, [α]D – 22.5o (c 0.02, CH2Cl2).

(1997).14 Each treatment consisted of 50 ants distributed in 5 Petri dishes. The leaf-cutting ants were isolated from their nest and fed with an artificial diet. The ants from the treatment received a diet added with epoxy-fraxinellone or limonexic acid, at a concentration of 200 μg. The ants from the control treatment were fed with a diet without this compound. During 25 days, the number of dead ants for each Petri dish was counted and a new portion of artificial diet given. It was estimated the survival curve of leaf-cutting ants of each treatment and calculated the median longevity. The test used for the statistic analyze of data was the Log rank-test (α=0.05). Results and Discussion The isolated degraded limonoids 1-3 were respectively identified as fraxinellone (1), fraxinellonone (2), epoxy- fraxinellone (3) and limonexic acid (4) by comparison with the spectral data described in the literature.10-13 Epoxy-fraxinellone has a quaternary epoxy group attached to C8-C14, instead of the double bond as in fraxinellone. The spectroscopic data published13 could not furnish clear evidence of the spatial configuration of this moiety. In an attempt to confirm the epoxy group position, nOe difference experiments were performed, but the defining signals were superimposed (in d-chloroform and benzene-d6), frustrating clear conclusions. In order to solve these indistinguishable findings, an X-ray analysis (Figure 1) was performed to confirm the epoxy group position. Single crystal of epoxy-fraxinellone was produced by recrystallization followed by a crystal-growing process. The recrystallization involved dissolution of the material in proper amount of ethyl acetate-acetone followed by drops of water. Suitable crystals were selected and analysed by single crystal X-ray diffraction which established undoubtedly the structure of the compound 3. Figure 1 shows an Ortep8 type view of 3 showing the thermal ellipsoids and atoms labels. This study shows that the molecular conformation of 3 is fixed by the presence of three main intramolecular interactions (Table 2). The analyses of the crystal packing showed the presence of others three intermolecular interactions in 3 (Table 3). These interactions give rise to the formation of infinite chains along the c axis (Figure 2). All geometrical details of the intermolecular contacts were interpreted as Table 1.

The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were elucidated on the basis of 1H NMR and EIMS spectra, and were in agreement with published data.10-12 The EI-mass spectra of both compounds shown to be formed mainly from the molecular ion by the consecutive exclusion of furan-3- aldehyde, CH3, HCHO and CO fragments. As previously reported, crude extracts of leaves and stems as well as fractions of R. echinata showed good inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth, the fungus cultured by the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa.16 Epoxy-fraxinellone showed not be toxic to the leaf- cutting ants, although limonexic acid displayed a significant reduction on lifetime (11 days) of leaf cutting ants, when compared with the control group (22 days) (Figure 3). Limonexic acid was also isolated from Dictamnus angustifolius17 a traditional plant used in China and from Tetradium trichotomum18 root barks, and together with isolimonexic acid are the main constituents of the fruit of Citrus nippokoreana.19 Despite being known since 1948,20 no significant reference of its bioactivity was found. Just a dozen degraded limonoids have been published, mainly from Rutaceae and Meliaceae plants. As the parent limonoids, some of them have been tested for biological activities including antifeeding and growth regulating activities against insects, and some relationship between the structures and biological activity has been studied.11 Table 2.

Among the 20 most commonly prescribed medications, six are from fungal origin.2 The versatility of microbial biosynthesis is conspicuous and the filamentous fungi, as well as the filamentous actinomycetes are the two most prolific groups capable of producing novel secondary metabolites.3 In the course of our screening program for antibiotic producers, we selected a Brazilian strain of Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from Pantanal (Mato Grosso do Sul State) soil sample. The interest in A. fumigatus metabolites is due to their broad range of biological activities.4 Moreover, Symoens et al.5 reported the high genetic polymorphism of A. fumigatus isolates, and according Debeaupuis et al.,6 the intraspecies variability at the genomic level appears to be very high, reflecting the environmental diversity of this species. Varga and Tóth7 described a general overview of the techniques used for the examination of the genetic variability of A. fumigatus and suggested that recombination played an important role in A. fumigatus populations. Different strains of the same fungus species may produce different compounds using the same medium.8 Also, the production of secondary metabolites by fungi may vary with the biotope in which they grow and to which they are adapted.9 Fumifungin and synerazol, new antifungal antibiotics, were isolated from the culture broth of A. fumigatus. Fumifungin was produced by a strain isolated from a Himalayan soil sample10 and synerazol was produced by a strain from Thailand soil sample.11 The study of a Brazilian strain of A. fumigatus, aiming to isolate and identify antimicrobial compounds, was undertaken based on the wide variability encountered for this species. Experimental Microorganisms Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from a soil sample collected in Pantanal – MS, Brazil and was identified by the “Fundação Tropical de Pesquisas e Tecnologia André Tosello”, Campinas– SP, Brazil. The microorganism is stored as a conidial suspension on silica gel (6 – 12 mesh, 1449 Diketopiperazines Produced by an Aspergillus fumigatus Brazilian Strain Vol. 16, No. 6B, 2005 grade 40, desiccant activated) at 4 °C. The Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 strains, used for antimicrobial evaluation, were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection. Metabolites production A two-step culture was performed for secondary metabolites production, consisting of an initial inoculum of a suspension of 4 x 106 conidia mL-1. The fungus was first grown at 40 °C in five Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of seed medium each.12 After 24 hours of the incubation on rotary shaker at 120 rpm, the resulting mycelia were harvested, rinsed and transferred to a 30 liter Micros I fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), containing 20 liters of fermentation medium (glycerol 1.5%, sucrose 1.5%, peptone 0.6%, yeast extract 0.15%, NaCl 3.0%, KH2PO4 0.06%, MgSO4. 7H2O 0.5%, CuSO4. 5H2O 0.0001%, FeSO4. 7H2O 0.0003% and dimethicone 0.01%). The initial pH value of the medium was set at 6.0, and the fermentation was carried out at 40 °C for 144 hours at 200 rpm in the first 24 hours. After that, the stirring speed was increased to 250, 280 and 300 rpm at 24, 48 and 72h, respectively. Then, the stirring speed was kept at 300 rpm for additional 72 hours, and aeration rate was maintained at 9 L min-1. Extraction and isolation of compounds The culture broth was separated from mycelium by filtration and submitted to three times partition with chloroform. The resulting chloroform fractions were combined and concentrated under vacuum to eliminate the organic solvent. Then, the crude chloroform extract (960 mg) was submitted to flash chromatography13 over 11 g of Si gel 60 (230-400 mesh), which was eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of methylene chloride-methanol 49:1. Thin- layer chromatography analysis of the 30 collected fractions allowed to assemble them into 19 fractions. Two active fractions (Fr-18 and Fr-19) were selected from guided bioassay, and further fractionated using an analytical HPLC system. Instrumentations consisted of a Shimadzu (SCL- 10Avp, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD- M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing. Analytical chromatography of the two active fractions, as well as of the unfermented medium extract was carried out using isocratic gradient (methanol-water 35:65). A CLC-ODS (M) – 4.6 x 250 mm Shimadzu column was used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. The spectral data from the detector were collected over the 200-400 nm range of the absorption spectrum. The Fr-18 (67.3 mg) yielded 1 (2.9 mg) and the Fr-19 (41 mg) afforded 2 (3.1 mg), 3 (1.4 mg), 4 (1.7 mg), 5 (3.2 mg), 6 (2.9 mg) and 7 (2.5 mg) after being purified by HPLC. Structure determination of compounds The structures of the compounds were determined by spectroscopic techniques, especially by detailed analyses of their 1H and 13C NMR spectra, including 2D NMR techniques (COSY, HMQC and HMBC), as well as mass spectrometry. The relative stereochemistries of the diketopiperazines were determined on the basis of the results of Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments. A modified version of Marfey’s method14 was used to determine the absolute stereochemistries of the individual diketopiperazines amino acids, which were obtained by acid hydrolysis. A small amount (100 mg) of each diketopiperazine was hydrolysed in 6 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid at 105 °C, under reflux, for 24 hours. The acid was removed under vacuum, and the acid-free mixture of amino acids was derivatized with the addition of 1-fluoro- 2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide (FDAA, Sigma). For that, 100 mg of the mixture of free amino acids were reacted with a solution of 1% FDAA in acetone (80 μL) followed by the addition of 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution (16 μL). Then, the resulting mixtures were kept at 40 °C for one hour. The molar ratio of FDAA to diketopiperazine was set at 2.8:1.0. HPLC was carried out using a reversed-phase column Nucleosil® 100-5 (4.6 mm x 250 mm ID) packed with 5 mm spherical silica (Macherey-Nagel). A linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)-MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)-MeCN (6:4), over 45 minutes (flow rate 1.0 mL min-1), was used to separate the FDAA derivatives, which were detected by UV at 340 nm. The L-amino acids (Aldrich Co.), used as chromato- graphic standards, were derivatized as described above, and the diketopiperazine individual amino acids were identified by co-injection with the standards ones. Bioassay The antimicrobial activity of the crude extract was investigated by using both agar diffusion, using Petri dish template system, and bioautography methods. For the first procedure, an aliquot of the extract, free of solvent, was dissolved (5.0 mg mL-1) in 50% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, v/v) aqueous solution and applied into the template holes on medium surface. Negative controls were run in parallel with DMSO aqueous solution and chloroform. Penicillin G (0.6075 U, 50 μL, Sigma) for Micrococcus luteus and penicillin G 1450 Furtado et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. (1.215 U, 50 μL, Sigma) for Staphylococcus aureus were used as positive controls. The inoculum was prepared by culturing each organism in antibiotic N° 1 agar medium (Merck) for 24 hours at 37 °C. The microorganisms were transferred to a 0.9% NaCl solution until they reached the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard. Each microorganism suspension (0.5%) was poured into antibiotic N° 1 agar medium, and distributed over the plates. For bioautography, the crude extract was dissolved (30 mg mL-1) in ethyl acetate, from which 8 μL were applied on silica gel G60 F254 thin layer chromatography plates. The chromatograms were developed in chloroform-methanol (93:7, v/v). After elution, the plates were carefully dried for complete removal of the solvents. Suspensions of micro- organisms were prepared in saline solution by comparison with the 0.5 McFarland standard. Afterwards, the suspensions were diluted (2%) in antibiotic N° 1 agar medium and distributed over the plates. Gentamicin discs were used as positive control. The thin layer chromatography plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humid chamber. Subsequently, the plates were overlaid with a solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.5%, m/v), and the growth inhibition was observed as clear zones on the chromatograms.15 The obtained fractions were evaluated by using bioautography technique, as described above, and the isolated compounds were evaluated in triplicate by microdilution broth method16, for which the compounds were solubilized in DMSO and diluted in tryptone soya broth in the range of 15 nmol L-1 to 2.9 mmol L-1. The inoculum was adjusted to each organism to achieve a cell Figure 1. Structures and NOESY correlations of the isolated compounds.

Penicillin G (Sigma) was used as positive control and the negative control was run for a solution of DMSO and tryptone soya broth. Also, it was included both inoculated wells, which controls the adequacy of the broth to support the growth of the organisms, and uninoculated wells, which was free of antimicrobial agent to verify the sterility of the medium. The microplates (96-well) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. After that, 40 μL of 2,3,5- triphenyltetrazolium chloride (0.7%) in aqueous solution were added to indicate the viability of microorganisms.17 Results and Discussion The crude chloroform extract from A. fumigatus culture broth exhibited activity against Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, providing inhibition zones of 21 mm ± 0.577 and 25 mm ± 0.577, respectively, by using the agar diffusion method. The results of bioautography analysis displayed two large overlapping inhibition zones, at Rf values of 0.34 and 0.52. The chromatographic purification of chloroform extract, by using a combination of Si gel flash chroma- tography and high-performance liquid chromatography, furnished 7 diketopiperazines (Figure 1). The identification of diketopiperazines 1-7 was straightforward based on the presence of both the characteristic 13C NMR chemical shifts for the amide carbonyl groups (δ 167-172) and the 1H NMR signals of the amino acids. The presence of proline moiety as one of the components of 1-4 and 7 was deduced by the presence of methylene multiplets in the spectra (δ 1.15 – 3.59, 6H) and by H-C correlations observed in the HMBC experiments. Analysis of HMBC experiment showed the correlation of C-1 and C-6 with H-3 for compounds 1, 3, 6 and 7. Compounds 5 and 6 bear a hydroxyproline moiety [δH 4.45 (H-4), δC 69.0 (C-4) and δH 4.27 (H-4), δC 68.9 (C-4), respectively] instead of a proline one. Analysis of the NMR spectra indicated that phenylalanine, glycine, valine and leucine were the other amino acid moieties present in compounds 1-7 (Table 1, 2 and 3). Diketopiperazine 1 bears the molecular formula C14H16N2O2, which was established by mass spectrometry, using electrospray ionization (ESI). The molecular weight of compound 1 was deduced as 244 by the quasimolecular ions at m/z 245 [M + H]+, 267 [M + Na]+ and 283 [M + K]+. The molecular formula of diketopiperazine 6 was assigned as C14H16N2O3, which contains one additional oxygen in relation to compound 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. with theirs 1H and 13C NMR data. The 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 6 displayed signals of methylene benzylic protons groups (H-10) attached to monosubstituted benzene rings (δ 3.14- 3.18). These data suggested a phenylalanine moiety for these compounds. The 1H spectrum of the compound 2 showed the signals at δ 4.06 (J 2.0 and 16.9 Hz, dd, 1H, H-9a) and δ 3.69 (J 16.9 Hz, d, 1H, H-9b), both protons are attached to a carbon at δ 45.8, as observed in HMQC experiment, indicating a glycine moiety for this compound. The 1H spectrum of the compound 4 displayed two doublets at δ 0.93 (J 6.9 Hz, 3H, H-11) and δ 1.07 (J 6.9 Hz, 3H, H-12) indicating the presence of two methyl groups. Moreover, the signals at δ 2.48 (J 2.5 and 6.9 Hz, dsept, 1H, H-10) and δ 4.01-4.03 (m, 1H, H-9) allowed to propose a valine moiety for this compound. The molecular formula of diketopiperazine 5 contains one additional oxygen in relation to compound 7. Their 1H and 13C NMR signals showed close correspondence, except for the signals of both hydroxyproline and proline residues, respectively. Their 1H spectra showed two doublets at δ 0.95 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12) and δ 0.94 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12) for 5 and 7, respectively, as well as other two doublets at δ 0.96 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-13) and δ 0.95 (J 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-13), indicating the presence of two methyl groups attached to the molecules. In addition, the signals at δ 4.13- 4.18 (m, 1H, H-9), δ 1.83- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-10a), δ 1.46- 1.53 (m, 1H, H-10b) and δ 1.83- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-11) of compound 5 and the signals at δ 4.09- 4.15 (m, 1H, H- 9), δ 1.81- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-10a), δ 1.47- 1.56 (m, 1H, H-10b) and δ 1.81- 1.94 (m, 1H, H-11) for compound 7 allowed to propose a leucine moiety for these compounds. The spectra data for all compounds showed signals due to one N-H proton (δ 4.56, br s, 1H), with exception of diketopiperazine 3. The EIMS data showed peaks at m/z 195 [M + H]+, 217 [M + Na]+ and 233 [M + K]+, which allowed to propose the structure of cyclo Pro-Pro for compound 3. 1H and 13C NMR previously reported data for the compounds 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are in agreement with obtained data for isolated diketopiperazines.18-20 Regarding the absolute stereochemistries of the diketopiperazines, it was possible to determine that all diketopiperazines were biosynthesized from L-amino acids (Table 4). All the derivatized obtained from the hydrolysis of the diketopiperazines displayed the same retention times of the derivatized standard L-amino acids. The modified Marfey’s method was successfully applied to the determi- nation of the absolute configuration of amino acids. It was done by using a linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)/ MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylamine phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.5)/MeCN (6:4), over 45 minutes, (flow rate 1.0 mL min-1). The original method describes a linear gradient starting with the mixture of triethyl- ammonium phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.0)/MeCN (9:1) and finishing with triethylammonium phosphate buffer (50 mmol L-1, pH 3.0)/MeCN (1:1), over 60 minutes (flow rate 2.0 mL min-1).14 Diketopiperazines corresponding to cyclic dipeptides have been isolated from microorganisms, sponges and from a variety of tissues and body fluids.18,21,22 These heterocyclic compounds display several biological properties, such as: antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral and plant growth regulation.19,23 Fdhila et al.20 reported the isolation of DD- diketopiperazines cyclo (D)-Pro-(D)-Phe, (D)-Pro-(D)-Leu, (D)-Pro-(D)-Val and (D)-4-OH-Pro-(D)-Phe from marine bacteria associated with cultures of Pecten maximus. These DD-diketopiperazines presented a potent inhibitory activity against the pathogen Vibrio anguillarum, while the LL-enantiomers were completely inactive.20 Therefore, the D-stereochemistry seems to be important for the biological activity.

This result is insignificant in comparison with penicillin, for which the MIC values were established at 0.25 ηmol L-1 and 0.12 ηmol L-1, respectively. It is important to point out that the literature reports24 the antimicrobial activity of the cycle (L)-Pro-(L)-Phe against a clinical isolated strain of Staphylococcus aureus at the concentration of 15 ηmol L-1 but, in the protocol used in this study, no activity was detected by using the mentioned concentration. The origin of diketopiperazines has been questioned, once several cyclic dipeptides have been found in fermentation broths and cultures of yeast, as well as in lichens and fungi.25 It is known that diketopiperazines can be generated via non-enzymatic cyclization of linear dipeptides at extremes of temperature.26 It was checked whether diketopiperazines would have been generated by heat sterilization and incubation of the medium culture during the fermentation process. However, these cyclic dipeptides were not detected in the HPLC profiles of the obtained extracts from the culture medium without the fungus. To our knowledge, these cyclic dipeptides have not been previously reported for A. fumigatus, with exception of the cyclo (L)-Pro-(L)-Leu. 27 Acknowledgments We are grateful to “Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP)” Brazil for financial support (proc. 99/09850-8), to Dr. Suraia Said for providing the strain of A. fumigatus, to Dr. Norberto P.

As estruturas destes compostos foram elucidadas por dados espectrométricos de 1D e 2D RMN, EM e IV. As substâncias 1 e 2 exibiram forte atividade antifúngica contra os fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum, bem como citotoxidade contra a linhagem celular de tumor cervical humano (HeLa), em experimentos in vitro. Two new metabolites, ethyl 2,4-dihydroxy-5,6-dimethylbenzoate (1) and phomopsilactone (2) were isolated from Phomopsis cassiae, an endophytic fungus in Cassia spectabilis. Their structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR, MS and IR spectral data. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed strong antifungal activity against the phytopatogenic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, as well as cytotoxicity against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa), in in vitro assays. Keywords: endophytic fungi, Phomopsis cassiae, Cassia spectabilis, cytotoxic metabolites, antifungal activity Introduction The genus Cassia, comprising about 600 species widely distributed worldwide, is well known for its diverse biological and pharmacological properties.1 Cassia spectabilis (sin Senna spectabilis) (DC) Irwin et Barn (Leguminosae) has been used in traditional Brazilian medicine for the treatment of flu and cold, as laxative and purgative.2 This observation prompted us to launch a program aiming to search novel bioactive metabolites from cultures of endophytes colonized inside C. spectabilis. Leaves of C. spectabilis were submitted to isolation of endophytic fungi and seven isolates were obtained, preserved and cultivated on liquid medium to get their crude extracts. The strain Phomopsis cassiae was selected for chemical and biological investigation because of the strong antifungal activity against the phytopatogenic fungi Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides. Fractionation of the crude EtOAc extract by flash chromatography column on reversed-phase C-18 silica, followed by reversed-phase HPLC, afforded compounds 1-2 and 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3). The structures of the new metabolites, ethyl 2,4-dihydroxy-5,6-dimethyl benzoate (1) and phomopsilactone (2) were determined by analysis of NMR and MS data. Results and Discussion Compound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous solid and its molecular formula C11H14O4 was deduced from 13C NMR and ESI-MS data [(M + H)+ at m/z 211]. This formula displayed five degrees of unsaturation. The 1H, 13C NMR 1464 Silva et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. (Table 1) and DEPT results for 1 suggested one phenyl group (five quaternaries carbons), an ester group, a -CH2CH3 moiety and two aromatic methyls. The ester moiety was in agreement with its absorption at 1633 cm-1 in IR, and the signal at δC 169.2. The DEPT results indicated two exchangeable protons, which were assigned to phenolic hydroxyls. The FeCl3 positive reaction and the IR absorption at 3435cm-1 confirmed phenolic hydroxyl groups consistent with the singlet at δH-3 6.26 (δC 99.9), indicating an aromatic hydrogen ortho-ortho dihydroxy- lated. The correlation in the COSY spectrum between H- 11 δH 1.26 (t, J 7.0 Hz) and H-10 δH 4.22 (q, J 7.0 Hz) evidenced an ethyl radical, and the heteronuclear correlation 3JCH between δH 4.22 (H-10) and δC 169.2 (C-7) confirmed the presence of an ethyl ester. The complete attribution of the hydrogen and carbon peaks was accomplished based on the data of 2D NMR (gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, gCOSY). In the gHMBC spectrum of 1, correlation of H-3 with C-1 and C-5, and H-9 with C-4 and C-6 allowed to assign the other substituents in the aromatic ring. In the NOESY spectrum of 1, a correlation between δH 2.10 (H-8) and δH 1.95 (H-9), confirmed the proximity of these methyls. Based on these data, the structure of 1 was established. This compound was previously published as a synthetic intermediate3-5 and, to our knowledge, is being reported at first time as a natural product along with its 1D and 2D NMR data. Compound 2 was isolated as an yellow solid and it was assigned the molecular formula C13H12O5 (eight insatu- ration degrees) based on HRESIMS [M + H]+ at m/z 249.0923], 13C NMR and DEPT data. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 showed two methyl resonances at δH 1.42 (d, J 7.0 Hz, 3H) and 1.97 (s, 3H), two vinilic protons at δH 4.68 (s, 1H) and δH 4.74 (s, 1H), an aldehyde at δH 10.11(s, 1H) and one benzylic methine at 4.51 (q, J 7.0 Hz, 1H). The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra (Table 1) displayed eight sp2 carbons (six attributed to aromatic carbons, two of them bonded to hydroxyls, and two olefinic) and two carbonyls, one assigned to lactone and another to aldehyde. The substituents in the aromatic ring were positioned by the heteronuclear correlations 2JCH and 3JCH in gHMBC, between H-13/C-4/C-3/C-5 and H-11/C-6/C-5. The upfield observed at C-13 (6.3) is an indicative that this methyl is surrounded by two oxygenated carbons C-3 (166.8) and C-5 (168.5). The hydrogen-bonded phenolic OH was placed ortho to the lactone substituent, based on its 1H NMR chemical shift. The connectivities between the subunits CH3CHC=CH2 and the aromatic ring were deduced from gHMBC correlations of H-12/C-7/C-8/C-9. The spatial correlations observed in 1D NOESY of H-11 with H-8/ H-12 and H-12 with H-11/H-10 aided in the structural confirmation of phomopsilactone (2). The known substance 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3) was identified by comparison of the physical constants and spectroscopic data with those published in literature.6 Phomopsilactone (2) is a new substance that surpri- singly contains a δ-methylene lactone subunit analogous to isotoralactone, a metabolite isolated from the plant Cassia obtusifolia.7 This polyketide presents sclerotinin skeleton, whose biosynthesis was proposed by Barber et al.8 and Tokoroyama and Kubota.10 The antifungal activity of compounds 1-3 against the phytopatogenic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides and Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR (500 and 125 MHz, δ value, J in Hz) spectral data and gHMBC correlations of 1a and 2b 1 2 Position 1H 13C gHMBC (H to C) 1H 13C gHMBC (H to C) 1 112.2 167.8 2 154.5 100.6 3 6.26 (s) 99.9 1, 5 166.8 4 157.2 112.4 5 113.8 168.5 6 135.9 110.5 7 169.2 150.9 8 2.10 (s) 17.1 1, 5, 6 4.51 (q; 7.0) 33.4 7, 12, 2 9 1.95 (s) 11.1 4, 5, 6 157.4 10 4.22 (q; 7.0) 60.2 7, 11 4.68 (s) / 4.74 (s) 97.4 9, 8 / 9, 8 11 1.26 (t; 7.0) 14.1 10 10.11 (s) 194.6 5, 6 12 1.42 (d; 7.0) 25.2 7, 8, 9 13 1.97 (s) 6.3 3, 4, 5 a in CD3OD, b in DMSO-d6. 1465 New Bioactive Metabolites Produced by Phomopsis cassiae Vol. 16, No. 6B, 2005 C. sphaerospermum was evaluated by bioautography11,12 and the detection limit for the compounds 1 and 2 was 1.0 μg, the same as for the positive control nystatin. Citotoxity of the compounds 1, 2 and 3 against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay.13 Compound 2 exhibited weak cytotoxity (IC50 200 μmol L-1) and 3 a strong cytotoxicity (IC50 10 μmol L-1). Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC50 5 μmol L-1. Experimental Instrumental and chromatography materials Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using a Perkin Elmer polarimeter with a sodium lamp at 598 nm and 25oC. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, using KBr pellets. The NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD and DMSO-d6, on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz. Mass spectra ESI-MS were obtained on a Fisons Platform VG mass spectrometer at 20 eV. For HRESIMS a Q-TOF Autospec-Micromass equipment was used. Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 (Merck). Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent, followed by heating at 120 ºC. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm x 21.20 mm) preparative column. Plant material The leaves of Cassia spectabilis were collected in June 2001 in Araraquara City. The botanical identification was made by Professor Maria Cláudia Marx Young and a voucher specimen (SILVA-193) has been deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botânica de São Paulo, Brazil. Fungal isolation Phomopsis cassiae was isolated from healthy leaves of Cassia spectabilis as previously reported.14,15 The fungus was identified by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited in the fungal herbarium of the Universidade Federal de Lavras, assigned as CML 292. The strain Phomopsis cassiae was subculture in Petri plates containing Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and incubated during seven days. After this period, it was inoculated at 25-28 oC in 28 Erlenmeyer flasks of 500 mL, each containing 200 mL of Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB). The cultures were incubated at 25 ºC and aerated by agitation on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 28 days. Extraction of the filtered fermentation broth (ca. 5.6 L) with ethyl acetate (3 x 2.4 L) provided the organic phase, that was dried with MgSO4 and concentrated to yield 277.1 mg of crude extract. Extraction and isolation The crude extract (277.1 mg) was chromatographed by CC using reverse phase silica (Merck LiChroprep® RP-18 25-40 mm; 3 x 15 cm) and eluted with H2O:MeOH (85:15 ) to MeOH (100%) gradient to afford 12 fractions (150 mL each, Fr-1 to Fr-12). The fraction Fr-2 (19.3 mg, H2O:MeOH - 65:35) was purified on a preparative HPLC column (RP - 18 H2O:ACN - 86:14, 10 mL min-1), yielding 3 (3.0 mg, tR = 35 min). The fractions Fr-9 (4.0 mg, H2O:MeOH - 35:65) and Fr-12 (4.6 mg, H2O:MeOH - 75:25), were analyzed by analytical HPLC [H2O:ACN (35:5) to ACN (100%) gradient, 40 min.] yielding 1 (4.0 mg, tR = 26.3 min) and 2 (4.6 mg, tR = 31.8 min). Antifungal assay The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPG 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491, have been maintained at the Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, Brazil and assays were performed using direct autobiography.11,12 Nystatin was used as positive control (detection limit 1μg). Cytotoxicity bioassay The human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described.13 Cisplatin was used as positive control (IC50 5.0 μmol L-1).

Entre eles, a 1,2-diidro-3β-hidroxi-7-desacetoxi-7-oxogedunina é uma substância inédita. Além disso, alguns deslocamentos químicos da xilocensina k foram corrigidos e os dados de RMN 1H da 7-desacetilgedunina são descritos pela primeira vez na literatura. Seis dos limonóides isolados foram submetidos a ensaios com formigas Atta sexdens rubropilosa e apresentaram atividade inseticida moderada. Nine limonoids were isolated from Carapa guianensis and Cedrela fissilis. Among them, 1,2-dihydro-3β-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin is a new compound. Moreover, the assignments of some chemical shifts of xyloccensin k have been corrected and 1H NMR data of 7-deacetylgedunin have been assigned for the first time. These isolated limonoids were assayed on Atta sexdens rubropilosa workers showing moderate insecticidal activities. Keywords: Meliaceae, Carapa guianensis, Cedrela fissilis, limonoids, insecticidal activity Introduction The family Meliaceae includes many plants that are sources of valuable timber and many that have wide- ranging uses in ethnomedicine. The family is distinguished by the occurrence of characteristic substances called limonoids.1 These substances have wide spectrum of biological activities,2 particularly insecticidal action.3 The leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex use mostly fresh plant fragments to raise their symbiotic fungi4,5 and are the cause of considerable economic damage, due to defoliation that they cause.6 Control of this pest is still problematic, presenting only temporary effects and is sometimes, harmful to the environment, to man and other animals.6,7 Consequently, an extensive search for alternate methods to control these insects has been made in an attempt to substitute traditional agrochemicals with agents that yield faster decay, higher specificity and, therefore, less damaging to the environment. In this context, plants are considered a promising source for less toxic compounds that could be used as a soft control method. As a part of our search for new natural insecticides against leaf-cutting ants8 and because of the fact that limonoids have displayed biological activity towards a variety of insects, we decided to investigate the effect of limonoids isolated from two species of Meliaceae family, Carapa guianensis Aubl. and Cedrela fissilis Vell. on Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Carapa guianensis is a tall tree that grows wild throughout South America, West India and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in areas of the Amazon rainforest, that are rich in soils and swamps. From the nuts of this plant is extracted an oil, called andiroba oil, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, such as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, anti-parasitic and as an anti-cancer remedy.9-12 Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic and linoleic acids, together with 2-5% of unsaponificable material. In addition, from several parts of Carapa guianensis have been isolated limonoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, flavonoids and diglycerides.13-18 C. fissilis tree, known as “cedro” (cedar), is a valuable source of timber. In Brazil, it can be found from the Amazon forest as far south as Espírito Santo State. Previous investigation of fruits and seeds from this species 543 Limonoids from Andiroba Oil and Cedrela fissilis and their Insecticidal Activity Vol. 17, No. 3, 2006 afforded the limonoids fissinolide, mexicanolide and 3β-hydroxyisomexicanolide.19 Extracts and fractions from C. fissilis and one commercial C. guianensis oil showed to have activity against A. sexdens rubropilosa workers.20,21 In the herein study we report the insecticidal activities towards A. sexdens rubropilosa of six gedunin derivatives limonoids obtained from these active fractions besides spectroscopic data for 1,2-dihydro-3β-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), 7-deacetylgedunin (6) and xyloccensin k (9). Results and Discussion The chemical investigation of one commercial andiroba oil sample afforded seven limonoids: 17β-hydroxyazadiradione (1), gedunin (2), 6α-acetoxy- gedunin (3), 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (4), 1,2-dihydro- 3β-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), methyl angolensate (8) and xyloccensin k (9). Moreover, from roots and leaves of C. fissilis were isolated 7-deacetyl- gedunin (6) and photogedunin (7) along with limonoids 2, 3, 4 and 5. Compounds 1, 2 and 9 have been isolated for the first time from C. guianensis and all the limonoids isolated from C. fissilis are new for this species. Compound 5 is new to the literature. Limonoids 1,22 2,23 3,13 4,15 7,24 and 825 were identified by comparison of their NMR spectral data to those previously reported in the literature. The 1H NMR data of compound 6 (Table 1) supplement and expand some hydrogen and carbon chemical shifts reported by Ekong and Olagbemi.26 Compound 5 was isolated as a white powder from C. fissilis leaves and from andiroba oil and identified by spectroscopic methods. It is a new compound, whose 3-OH epimer was obtained from Guarea thompsonii.27 The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 5 exhibited signals at: δH 7.40 (m), 7.36 (m), 6.36 (s) and δC 143.0, 141.0, 120.4, 109.9 of a β-furanyl ring; δH 1.13 (s), 1.12 (s), 1.08 (s), 0.98 (s), 0.84 (s) and δC 27.4, 20.9, 17.1, 16.9, 14.8 related to five tert-methyl groups; δH 5.45 (s), 3.83 (s) and δC 167.3, 65.7, 53.6, 78.1 corresponding to a lactone D-ring with an epoxide between C-14 and C-15. These features are characteristics of compounds classified in the gedunin group of limonoids. However, the NMR spectra of compound 5 lacked signals related to the A-ring α,β-insaturated ketone. In contrast, signals were observed at δH 3.26 (dd, 11.0 and 5.0 Hz) and δC 78.2. These signals indicated an equatorial hydroxyl group at C-3. Thus, limonoid 5 was identified as 1,2-dihydro-3β-hydroxy-7- deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and its spectral data allocations (Table 1) were established unequivocally through 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Compound 9 was isolated as a white powder from andiroba oil. It is classified as belonging to the mexicanolide group of limonoids and contains a tetrahydrofuran sub-unit with an oxygen bridge linking from C-3 to C-8. It was also isolated from the seed of Xylocarpus granatum.28 However, we found through 2D NMR spectra analysis that some chemical shifts were incorrectly determined by Kokpol et al.,28 among them H-17, H-28, H-29, C-8, C-17, C-18 and C-29. The chemical shift of C-17 was deduced from 1J correlation between H-17 (δ 6.28, s) and one carbon at δ 76.5. H-18 (δ 1.00, s) was assigned through 3J correlation between the methyl hydrogens and carbinolic carbon at δ 76.5 (C-17). Furthermore, H-28 (δ 1.12) and H-29 (δ 0.67) were determined through 3J correlation to C-3 (δ 91.4). Finally, the 2J-3J correlations among H-30 (δ 2.52, dd, 12.4 and 6.1 Hz), H-2 (δ 2.98, br t, 6.1 Hz) and a quaternary carbon at δ 85.2 established C-8. Some of the limonoids isolated from C. guianensis and C. fissilis were evaluated for their effects on A. sexdens rupropilosa ants. The results (Table 3) showed that control and limonoid-treated groups had on average the same Table 1.

The gedunin type limonoids do not seem to be highly active against these ants. Indeed, C-seco limonoids, such as azadirachtin, are more active insecticidal compound, possessing both antifeedant and growth-regulating activities.2,29 The toxicity for the ants observed for the C. fissilis and C. guianensis extracts seems not to be related only to the presence of the limonoids. Perhaps the limonoids act in synergism between them or with other compounds in the extracts. Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using Bruker DRX-200 and ARX- 400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. HPLC was carried out using a preparative LC-8A Shimadzu system with SPD-6AV Shimadzu UV detector. Plant material The roots and leaves of Cedrela fissilis Vell. were collected in São Carlos-SP, Brazil in June 01, 2001 and identified by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, where a voucher specimen (6701) was deposited. The commercial andiroba oil sample was purchased in Belém city (Pará, Brazil), in 1996. Isolation of the limonoids from Carapa guianensis A portion of andiroba oil sample (21.0 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH gradient, to yield the four corresponding fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (2.6 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 267 x 38 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane→MeOH gradient) to give three fractions. The second fraction (Ac2; 2.3 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 264 x 45 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity Table 2.

Another portion of the andiroba oil sample (150.0 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield four fractions (FH, FD, FA, FM). Fraction FA (19.0 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 309 x 38 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane:CH2Cl2:acetone→MeOH gradient) to give nine fractions. Several chromatographies of fractions five, seven and eight (FA5, FA7 and FA8) afforded limonoids 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, as described below. The fifth fraction (FA5; 1.1 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 269 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2:acetone→MeOH) to afford nine fractions.

Isolation of the limonoids from Cedrela fissilis The powdered air-dried roots from C. fissilis were extracted by maceration for three times (72 h) with hexane, dichloromethane and and/or methanol at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. A portion of the hexane extract (3.5 g) from roots of C. fissilis (RH) was submitted to VLC on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (704 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (230- 400 mesh), and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1) to give 5 fractions (A→E). Fraction E was twice chromatographed as above to give four fractions. Fraction E-4 was submitted to HPLC [Asahipak GS-310 2G polymeric column, 500 x 22 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH (100%), at a flow rate of 5 mL min-1, detector UV at 254 nm] affording 2 (13.1 mg) and 3 (2.5 mg). The powdered air-dried leaves from C. fissilis were extracted by maceration as described above. The CH2Cl2 extract (29.0 g) from leaves of C. fissilis (LH) was submitted to VLC as described to the hexane extract from roots (RH). The CH2Cl2-soluble fraction (6.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (70-230 mesh)-florisil (1:1), with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient to afford 9 fractions (A→I). Fraction D was three times chroma- tographed with hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3.5:0.5) to give 4 (8.3 mg) and 6 (5.1 mg).

Bioassays The A. sexdens rubropilosa workers used in the assays were randomly removed from laboratory nests. They had a combined body mass of 20-25 mg. Before assaying the nests were supplied daily with leaves of Eucalyptus sp., oat seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such as Hibiscus sp., Ligustrum sp. or rose petals. Fifty ants were randomly removed from the nests and distributed to five Petri dishes (ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assays the ants were maintained on an artificial diet consisting of glucose (50 g L-1), bacto-peptone (10 g L-1), yeast extract (1.0 g L-1) and agar (15 g L -1) in distilled water (100 mL).30 The diets (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of limonoids (experiment) or without (control) were supplemented daily in small plastic caps. The control was prepared with the diet and the solvent. The compounds were poured into the hot diet immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration of the limonoids added to the diet was 100 μg mL-1. To ensure that undetectable remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants, a comparison was made with another set of dishes in which water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not shown). During the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at a temperature of 25 (±1) oC and relative humidity ranging between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation was 25 days and the number of dead ants was recorded daily. The survival average 50% (S50) was calculated and survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted software Graph-Pad TM using the log-rank test. Figure 1.

Lineu Prestes, 748, 05508-900 São Paulo-SP, Brazil A biotransformação da lignana tetraidrofurânica, (-)-grandisina, pelo fungo endofítico Phomopsis sp, obtido de Viguiera arenaria, conduziu à formação de um novo metabólito caracterizado como 3,4-dimetil-2-(4’-hidróxi-3’,5’-dimetóxifenil)-5-metóxi-tetraidrofurano. O metabólito foi analisado contra o parasita Trypanosoma cruzi, o agente causador da doença de Chagas, e mostrou uma atividade tripanocida (IC50 9,8 µmol L-1) similar ao precursor natural (IC50 3,7µmol L-1). The biotrasformation of the tetrahydrofuran lignan, (-)-grandisin, by the endophitic fungus Phomopsis sp, obtained from Viguiera arenaria, led to the formation of a new compound determined as 3,4-dimethyl-2-(4’-hydroxy-3’,5’-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methoxy-tetrahydrofuran. The metabolite was evaluated against the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas’s disease, and showed a trypanocidal activity (IC50 9.8 µmol L-1) similar to the natural precursor (IC50 3.7 µmol L-1). Keywords: biotransformation, 2,5-diaryltetrahydrofuran, endophytic fungus, (-)-grandisin, trypanocidal activity Introduction The lignan family is a large group of natural products with noteworthy therapeutic activity as illustrated by podophyllotoxin derivatives (e. g. etoposide) with antitumoral activity.1 In particular, the optically active tetrahydrofuran lignans display a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-parasite,2-4 antibacterial,5 antifungal,6 anti- tumoral,7 anti-inflammatory8,9 and platelet-activating factor (PAF) inhibition.10-12 Several non-symmetrical 2,5-diaryltetrahydrofuran lignans, shown in Table 1, have been isolated from Piper species (Piperaceae) containing either piperonyl, veratryl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl substituent at 2 and 5 positions and methyl groups at 3 and 4 positions attached to the tetrahydrofuran ring, as illustrated by (+)-calopiptin (1, P. schmidtii), 5-[rel-(2S,3S,4S,5S)-5’-(3’’,4’’- dimethoxyphenyl)-3’,4’-dimethyl-2’-tetrahydro-furanyl)]- 1,3-benzodioxole (2, P. wightii), (2S,3R,4S,5R)-3,4- dimethyl-2,5-bis(3’,4’-dimethoxyphenyl)-tetrahydrofuran (3, P. clarkii), (±)-galgravin (4, P. futokadsura, P. hancei, P. puberculum, P.wallichii), (-)-galbelgin (5, P. attenuatum, P. futokadsura, P. thomsoni, P. wightii), (+)-grandisin (6, P. polysyphorum), (+)-machilin G (7, P. schmidtii, P. wightii), (+)-veraguensin (8, P. cuneifolium, P. futokadsura, P. puberculum) and (-)-zuonin A (9, P. schmidtii).13 Other bis-tetrahydrofuran lignans have also been described from Achillea lingulata (Asteraceae).14 In previous reports, Martins et al.3 described the isolation of (-)-grandisin (6) from Piper solmsianum and Lopes and co-workers 4,15 from Virola surinamensis (Rol.) Warb, which belong to Piperaceae and Myristicaceae, respectively. The tetrahydrofuran lignan (-)-grandisin (6) showed a potent trypanocidal activity against the trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi, responsible for Chagas´s disease in Latin America, at 5 µg mL-1 leading to a total parasite lysis after 24 h, without hematiae damage.4 Furthermore, veraguensin (8) also isolated from Virola surinamensis4 preserved this anti-parasite pattern along with a potent platelet-activating factor (PAF) inhibitory activity that may be involved in the mechanisms of the parasite growing and differentiation.16 Nevertheless, attempts to overcome Biotransformation of a Tetrahydrofuran Lignan by the Endophytic Fungus Phomopsis Sp. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 196 the poor water solubility of compounds 6 and 8 for in vivo evaluation, comprising semi-synthetic modifications such as O-demethylation of the methoxy groups attached to the aromatic rings, led to byproducts due to the presence of two benzylic carbons in the tetrahydrofuran ring that were very unstable under acidic or base conditions.17 The biotransformation of the naturally occurring 2,5-diaryl-3,4-dimethyltetrahydrofurans with PAF inhibitory activity, such as (+)-veraguensin (8), (+)-galbelgin (3) and galgravin (4) named as 7,7’-epoxylignans, has been investigated in order to obtain novel and bioactive derivatives. In the series, carrying a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl substituents pattern, both methyl groups at para-position of the aromatic rings were metabolized and cleaved by Aspergillus niger yielding the corresponding 4,4’-O-demethyl derivatives.18 Similar results were also achieved using furofuran lignans with the 2,6-diaryl-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton,19 such as (+)-magnolin and (+)-eudesmin. Replacing the 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl groups by 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl (e. g. (+)-yangabin) and 4,5-dihydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl groups on the lignans lead to a stable para-methoxy groups not cleaved by A. niger. On the other hand, the use of larvae of Spodoptera litura20 or rats as a source of liver metabolized enzymes21,22 allowed the O-demethylation at the para-position of both aromatic rings of furofuran lignans containing either di- or trimethoxyphenyl groups, being the pre-formed hydroxyl group frequently conjugated to glycosides. The grandisin (6) has also been di-O- demethylated by Lepidopterae and Coleoptera species.23 The biotransformation reactions of lignans, including podophyllotoxin, and neolignans was described in a recent review.24 Endophytic fungi are prolific producers of natural products, since they live inside the health plant tissues without causing any apparent disease.25 These environmental conditions might stimulate the fungi to produce a range of metabolic enzymes as a requirement for their survival in the presence of toxic defense compounds of plants.26 Endophytes have also been successfully used in the biotransformation of natural products.27,28 These findings stimulated us to investigate about 20 endophytic strains from our collection of fungi29 as biocatalyst systems and effective method for regio- and stereoselective production of novel and bioactive products. This procedure could convert unreactive methoxy groups to hydroxyl functions of a tetrahydrofuran lignan under mild conditions which may increase the solubility of 6. Thus, this study focuses on the biotransformation of 6 by four different endophytic fungi with the aim to obtain potential trypanocidal derivatives with improved drug-like properties. Experimental General procedures GC-MS were measure at 70 eV on a Shimadzu Model: QP2010, 120 ºC (oven temp.), using a DB-5MS (30m × Table 1.

ESI analysis were performed on a ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF MS (End Plate: 4000 Volts, Capillary: 4500 Volts, Capillary Exit: 300 Volts, Skimmer 1: 50 Volts, Skimmer 2: 25 Volts, Transfer: 90 µs, Collision Exit Gate: 80 µs).1H NMR spectrum was measured on a Bruker DPX- 400 (400 MHz) while 2D experiments (HSQC and HMBC) were recorded in a Bruker DRX-400 (400 and 100 MHz) using CDCl3 (Aldrich) as solvent and TMS as int. standard. Chemical shifts were reported in units (ppm) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. TLC: silica gel 60 F254 pre-coated (layer thickness 0.25 mm, Merck); CC: silica gel with hexane- EtOAc 4:6, v/v. The instrumentations for HPLC analysis consisted of a Shimadzu (SCL-10Avp, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SCL-M10vp Photodiode Array detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control and data collection. Chromatography was carried out using the isocratic method with methanol:water 7/3, v/v within 20 minutes during the screening phase for the evaluation of grandisin biotransformation (condition A). The mobile phase used during the isolation of the metabolites was methanol:water 6:4, v/v within 60minutes (condition B). A CLC-ODS (M)- 4.6 × 250mm Shimadzu column was used at a flow of 1.0 mL min-1. The spectral data from the detector were collected over de 200-400 nm range of absorption chromatograms, and the chromatograms were plotted at 225 nm. Grandisin was obtained from dichloromethane extracts from twigs of Virola surinamensis, which yielded two steroids, two lignans (compounds 6 and 8), five flavonoids and one polyketide.4 Microorganisms and culture The endophytic fungi have been isolated and identified by their rDNA sequences as previously described.29 The strains are maintained on PDA slants at 4 ºC. Initially the fungi were screened for their ability to transform grandisin. Fungi were cultivated on PDA in Petri dish for 7 days at 30 ºC and agar pieces (1 cm2) containing fungal mycelia was used as inocullum. Strain SS42 was also identified by “Micoteca URM/ Depto. de Microbiologia/ CCB/ UFPE” (Av. Prof. Nelson Chaves, s/n, 50670-420 Recife-PE, Brazil). A two-step culture was used for each fungus. Initially, the fungi were inoculated into 20 mL of Czapek medium, supplemented with 3% of sucrose and the cultures were incubated at 30 ºC for 3 days, with shaking at 120 ºC rpm. After cultivation the resulting mycelia were harvested by filtration and transferred to 20 mL of Czapek medium, containing 1% of sucrose and supplemented with a solution of grandisin in DMSO, resulting 0.4 mg mL-1 as final concentration in the media. The cultures were reincubated at the same conditions for 8 days. Extraction of the metabolites The culture broths were separated from mycelia by vacuum filtration, followed by 3 times partition sequentially with ethyl ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol (10 mL). The solvents were evaporated and the crude extracts were analyzed by TLC and HPLC (condition A). Isolation of the metabolites After the preliminary screening, Phomopsis sp (VA35) culture was scaled up to 150 mL using the same conditions already described, including the proportion of grandisin (6) (60 mg), but changing the fermentation time to 9 days. The ethyl ether and ethyl acetate extracts were joined because they showed similar profiles. The crude extract obtained was purified by Silica-gel column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate 1:1, yielding 4 fractions. Fraction 3 was further purified through HPLC (Condition B) to yield compound 10 (1.0 mg). In vitro trypanocidal assay The bioassays were carried out using the blood of infected Swiss albino mice, collected by cardiac puncture on the parasitemy peak (7th day) after infection with Y strains of T. cruzi. The infected blood was diluted with the blood health mice to achieve a concentration of 106 trypomastigote per mL. The assays were performed on titration microplates (96 wells) in duplicate. The compound 10 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and was added into the infected mouse to provide concentration of 0.5, 2.0, 8 and 32 µmol L-1. The plates were incubated at 4ºC and the numbers of parasites were counted after 24h. Negative and positive controls containing either DMSO or crystal violet at 250 µg mL-1, respectively were run in parallel.30 Results and Discussion The microbial transformations of (-)-grandisin (6) by endophytic fungi were investigated in a small scale screening test (8 mg) monitored by TLC and HPLC analyses (condition A). Among the 20 endophytic fungi, Curvularia lunata (SS-42), isolated from Smallanthus sonchifolius, and Phomopsis sp. (VA-35), obtained from Viguiera arenaria, showed better results in the biotransformation of 6. Phomopsis sp. was selected to be cultivated in large Biotransformation of a Tetrahydrofuran Lignan by the Endophytic Fungus Phomopsis Sp. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 198 scale experiments because of its great ability to generate metabolites in the preliminary tests. The metabolization of compound 6 (60 mg), with a retention time of 40.23 min as indicated by HPLC analysis (condition B), led to the generation of a major metabolite (10) with a distinct retention time of 10.35 min. Compound 10 was purified by column chromatography, followed by HPLC (condition B). Condition B was established by exploring its different interaction properties with the reverse phase column (C-18), in a manner similar to that previously reported for butyrolactones isolated from Virola surinamensis.31,32 GC-MS analysis showed that compound 10 has a molecular weight lower than grandisin with a [M]+. at m/z 282 and fragments (m/z 68, 85, 100, 167 and 182) suggesting the molecular formula C15H22O5. In fact, the High Resolution Mass Spectrometry confirms the proposed molecular formula with a detectable [M + Na]+ 305.1368 and a corresponding theoretic mass of 305.1365. The structure of compound 10 was established by 1D and 2D NMR data. For instance, the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 10 showed two methoxy proton signals at d 3.37 and 3.83 with a relative integration of 3:6, which were characteristic of groups attached to aliphatic and aromatic skeleton, respectively. Moreover, the ortho-aromatic proton signals were assigned at d 6.52 (s, 2H), while the methyl groups at C-13 and C-12 were observed at d 1.10 and d0.87 as two doublets (J 6.9 Hz). Nearly all relevant spectral details of the isolated metabolites were closely comparable to the corresponding 13C and 1H features of grandisin,4,33 but no data for the second aromatic ring were observed by the integration of signals. In addition, a hemiacetal proton was observed at d 4.71 (d, 1H), attached to a carbon at d 111.1 as observed in the HMQC experiment. Also, the signal at d 3.83 was assigned to the methoxy groups at meta positions of the remaining aromatic ring linked to the tetrahydrofuran nucleus, indicating the presence of a free hydroxyl group at para position. Methoxy aliphatic protons at d 3.37 and methyl protons at d 1.10 showed correlation in the HMBC with carbon at d 111.1, unequivocally establishing the methoxy group at C-5. These data confirmed the presence of a single aromatic ring in compound 10, and an extra methoxy group at C-5. The main HMBC correlations for compound 10 are shown in Figure 1 and data described in Table 2. Thus, from the foregoing spectral data the structure of compound 10 was characterized as 3,4-dimethyl- 2-(4’-hydroxy-3’,5’-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methoxy- tetrahydrofuran. To our knowledge, this compound has not been previously described in the literature. We propose that the peculiar aliphatic methoxy groups of compound 10 should be generated firstly by a microbial oxidative metabolism at position C-5 followed by rearrangement to a lactone displacing the aromatic ring. Further reduction to the hemiketal function and O-methylation of the nearly formed hydroxyl group might explain how the fungus converted the 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl group of compound 6 to methoxy group of the metabolite 10. The HPLC separation (condition B) provided a second metabolite with a retention time of 12.50 min. GC-MS analysis showed that this compound has the same molecular weight and fragments presented by compound 10. The High Resolution Mass Spectrometry detected [M + Na]+ 305.1368. 1H NMR spectrum revealed the same integrals, but insufficient data could be obtained from 2D analysis because of the small isolated quantity. The results from 1H NMR spectrum, GC-MS and high resolution mass spectrometry suggested that this secondary compound might be an epimer of compound 10. Figure 1.

Conclusions The product 3,4-dimethyl-2-(4’-hydroxy-3’,5’- dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methoxy-tetrahydrofuran (10) was successfully obtained from the biotransformation of grandisin (6) by the endophytic fungus Phomopsis sp. The evaluation of the trypanocidal activity of compound 10 and its corresponding natural precursor 6 gave similar results, revealing that a unique methoxylated aromatic ring bound to the central tetrahydrofuran scaffold might preserve the trypanocidal activity, this represents an interesting molecular simplification for synthetic purposes.

Merr. foram avaliados para suas atividades in vitro contra linhagens de Plasmodium falciparum sensíveis a cloroquina 3D7, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB9000 e Leishmania donovani L82. Ensaios com células KB foram também executados com o objetivo de se determinar o grau de toxicidade das substâncias ativas contra os parasitas. Nove dos compostos apresentaram IC50 entre 0,3 e 11,6 µM contra P.falciparum. Em contraste, um pequeno número de compostos mostrou atividade significativa contra T. brucei rhodesiense e nenhum apresentou atividade contra L. donovani. Entre os alcalóides três tiveram IC50 < 1,0 µM contra P. falciparum, enquanto que contra T. b. rhodesiense cinco mostraram IC50 < 10 µM. A caracterização dos alcalóides, 1,3,5-triidróxi-4-metóxi-10-metil-2,8- bis(3-metilbut-2-enil)acridin-9(10H)-ona (1), 2,3-diidro-4,9-diidróxi-2-(2-hidróxipropan-2-il)- 11-metóxi-10-metilfuro[3,2-b]acridin-5(10H)-ona (2) e 3,4-diidro-3,5,8-triidróxi-6-metóxi-2,2,7- trimetil-2H-pirano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)-ona (3), é aqui discutida.

O isolamento e dados espectrais para os alcalóides 1-3 estão sendo aqui descritos pela primeira vez, embora em trabalho anterior tenham sido relatadas as suas atividades citotóxicas. Eleven acridone alkaloids isolated from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. were examined for in vitro activity against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB900 and Leishmania donovani L82. An assay with KB cells was developed in order to compare in vitro toxicity of alkaloids with the selective action on the parasites. Nine of the compounds had IC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 11.6 µM against P. falciparum. In contrast, a small number of compounds showed significant activity against T. brucei rhodesiense and none had activity against L. donovani. Among the alkaloids three had IC50 < 1.0 µM against P. falciparum, whereas against T. b. rhodesiense five had IC50 < 10 µM. The characterization of the acridone alkaloids, 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one (1), 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-11-methoxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-b] acridin-5(10H)-one (2) and 3,4-dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl-2H- pyrano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)-one (3), is discussed, as well as the structure-activity relationship of all compounds assayed. Isolation and spectral data of alkaloids 1-3 are described for the first time although their citotoxicities to cancer cells have been described before. Keywords: antiparasitic acridone alkaloids, malaria, Swinglea glutinosa, Rutaceae Introduction Parasitic protozoa are the causative agents of human and livestock diseases infecting hundreds of millions of people every year and are collectively one of most important causes of human misery.1 Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, malaria, Chagas’ disease and leishmaniasis are major health problems in many countries. HAT promoted by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense is endemic in over 30 African countries threatening over 60 million people. HAT has reached epidemic proportions in some countries, such as Angola, southern Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.2,3 Malaria has re-emerged as a major public health problem over the past three decades mainly because of the development of worldwide resistance of Plasmodium dos Santos et al. 645 Vol. 20, No. 4, 2009 falciparum to chloroquine, a drug which formed the basis for cheap and effective treatment and for prophylaxis of this disease.4 Each year, approximately 300 to 500 million malaria infections lead to over one million deaths. In many endemic countries, malaria is responsible for economic stagnation, lowering the annual economic growth in some regions by up to 1.5%.5,6 Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. According to WHO 88 countries are affected, with 350 million people at risk. 90% of cases of visceral leishmaniasis occur in India, Sudan, Bangladesh and Brazil.7 Present chemotherapy for these diseases is inadequate or toxic, or becoming ineffective due to an increase in resistance.8 The family Rutaceae contains many secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins, limonoids and lignans with a large spectrum of biological activities.9 Studies showed that acridone alkaloids are compounds with promising activity against P. falciparum,10,11 and also have antiviral12 and antiproliferative effects on cancer cell lines.13,14 The Asian genera Citrus and Swinglea are members of the Rutaceae and are included in the subfamily Aurantioideae. Citrus species have been investigated and characterized by possessing acridone alkaloids. These data stimulated an investigation of Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. in a search for lead acridones. From the MeOH extract of the stem bark of S. glutinosa three new acridone alkaloids were identified: 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-2,8-bis(3- methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one (1), 2,3-dihydro- 4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-11-methoxy- 10-methylfuro[3,2-b]acridin-5(10H)-one (2) and 3,4-dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl- 2H-pyrano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)-one (3). In addition, eight known alkaloids were characterized by the analysis of their NMR spectra and compared with reference data: 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-10-methyl- 9-acridone (4),10 glycocitrine-IV (5),15 citrusinine-II (6),16 citrusinine-I (7),17 citibrasine (8),16 5-hydroxynoracronycine (9),18 pyranofoline (10)19 and bis-5-hydroxynoracronycine (11)20. These alkaloids were tested in vitro against chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum 3D7, T. b. rhodesiense STIB900, L. donovani L82 and their toxicity effects were also evaluated on KB cells. Antiparasitic Activities of Acridone Alkaloids from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 646 Results and Discussion Compound 1 was isolated as an amorphous powder, the molecular formula was determined as C25H29NO5 by HRESIMS, showing an [M+H]+ peak at m/z 424.2124. The UV absorptions bands at λmax/nm: 222, 265, 285, 332 and 410 nm, IR absorptions at νmax/cm-1: 3500 and 1625 cm and the characteristic signal of a hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl proton at d 14.42 in the 1H NMR spectra, exchangeable with D2O, suggested the presence of a hydroxyl group. These data together with analyses of the 13C NMR spectrum, suggested that compound 1 had a 1-hydroxy-9-acridone framework.16-22 The 1H NMR spectrum of the compound 1 showed two AB type aromatic protons at d 7.17 (1 H, d, J 8.0Hz, H-6) and 6.96 (1H, d, J 8.0Hz, H-7), one N-methyl group at d3.74 and one O-methyl group at d 3.76. Also signals of two trisubstituted double bonds at d 5.41(1H, m, H-2''), 5.31 (1H, m, H-2'), two methylene protons at d 4.01 (2H, d, J 7.0Hz, H-1’’), 3.40 (2H, d, J 7.0Hz, H-1’), the former protons being deshielded by the 9-carbonyl group, and four vinyl methyl groups [d 1.80 (3H,d, J 0.9Hz, H-4’ E), 1.65 (3H,d, J 1.0Hz, H-5’ Z), 1.74 (3H,d, J 0.9Hz, H-4’’ E), 1.69 (3H,d, J 1.0Hz, H-5’’ Z)] were observed, which suggested the presence of two prenyl groups (3-methylbut-2-enyl). Their positions were confirmed at C-2 and C-8 by HMBC. The position of a prenyl group at C-2 was confirmed by the correlation of the methylene protons at d 3.40 (H-1') with C-1 (d 158.1), C-2 (d 109.4), C-3 (d 156.1), C-2' (d 123.6) and C-3' (d 131.4) in the HMBC spectrum. In addition, the correlation of 1-OH at d 14.42 with C-1 and C-9a (d 107.6) confirmed that the first prenyl group was attached to C-2. The position of the second prenyl group was confirmed by the correlation of the deshielded methylene protons at d 4.01 (H-1'') with C-7 (d 125.4), C-8 (d 135.0), C-2'' (d 125.4) and C-3'' (d 131.2), confirming that the second prenyl group was attached to C-8. The N-methyl protons showed correlation with C-4a and C-5a at d 140.2 and 139.4, respectively. The O-methyl protons showed correlation with C-4 at d 128.8. This value is consistent with the acridone possessing an O-methyl group at C-4.17,23 Based on these data, the structure of 1 was characterized as 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10- methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one. Table 1 shows the data of 1H, 13C NMR and correlations observed in the HMBC experiment. Compound 2 was isolated as an amorphous powder, the molecular formula C20H21NO6 was determined on the basis of HRESIMS, exhibiting an [M+H]+ peak at m/z 372.1447. The UV and IR spectra were identical to those of 1, however some differences were observed in the 1H and 13C NMR. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the characteristic signal of a hydrogen-bonded hydroxy proton at d 14.42, exchangeable with D2O suggested the presence of a hydroxyl group. These data suggested that compound 2 had a 4-hydroxy- 5-acridone skeleton.16-22 The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed an ABX type aromatic spin system at d 7.15 (1 H, t, J 7.8Hz, H-7), 7.29 (1H, dd, J 7.8, 1.4Hz, H-8) and 7.80 (1H, dd, J 7.8, 1.4Hz, H-6), this last proton being deshielded by the 5-carbonyl group. The spectrum also showed one N-methyl group at d 3.85 and one O-methyl group at d 3.89. The presence of a hydroxyisopropyldihydrofuran moiety was suggested by an oxymethine proton at d 4.88 (1H, dd, J 9.4, 7.8Hz, H-2), methylene protons as two dd in an AB system at d 3.20 (1H, dd, J 15.5, 7.8Hz, H-3a) and 3.26 (1H, dd, J 15.5, 9.4Hz, H-3b), two methyl groups at d 1.33 (3H, s, H-2') and 1.29 (3H, s, H-3'). The signal at d 93.0 and 71.5 in the 13C NMR spectrum supported the presence of this substituent in the acridone nucleus.23 Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR and HMBC data for compound 1 (acetone-d6) Position 13Ca d 1Hb d (mult., J in Hz) HMBCb (H-C) 1 158.1 1-OH 14.42 (s) C-1, C-2 2 109.4 3 156.1 4 128.8 4ª 140.2 5 147.3 5ª 139.4 6 120.0 7.17 (d, 8.0) C-5, C-8, C-5a 7 125.4 6.96 (d, 8.0) C-8a, C-1’’ 8 135.0 8a 123.6 9 185.5 9a 107.6 N-CH3 45.3 3.74 (s) C-4a, C-5a O-CH3 59.8 3.76 (s) C-4 1’ 22.4 3.40 (d, 7.0) C-1, C-2, C-3, C-3’, C-2’ 2’ 123.6 5.31 (m) C-4’, C-5’ 3’ 131.4 4’ 25.9 1.65 (d, 1.0) C-2’, C-3’, C-5’ 5’ 17.8 1.80 (d, 0.9) C-2’, C-4’, C-3’ 1’’ 34.3 4.01 (d, 7.0) C-7, C-8, C-2’’, C-3’’ 2’’ 125.4 5.41 (m) C-4’, C-5’’ 3’’ 131.2 4’’ 25.9 1.74 (d, 0.9) C-2’’, C-3’’, C-5’’ 5’’ 18.0 1.69 (d, 1.0) C-2’’, C-3’’, C-4’’ a Recorded at 100 MHz; b Recorded at 400 MHz. dos Santos et al. 647 Vol. 20, No. 4, 2009 The presence of a linear orientation of the hydroxyisopropyldihydrofuran moiety was confirmed by correlations of the methylene protons at d 3.20 (H-3) with C-3a (d 109.4), C-2 (d 93.0) and C-1' d 71.5 and the correlations of the 4-OH at d 14.31 with C-4a (d 108.4), C-4 and C-3a in the HMBC spectrum. The spectrum also showed the correlation of the signals of the N-methyl protons at d 3.85 with d 143.5 and 138.0 assigned to C-11a and C-9a, respectively. The O-methyl proton at d 3.89 showed correlation with C-11 at d 126.6. The correlation at H-6, H-7 and H-8 in the HMBC spectrum allowed the assignments of the carbons C-9, C-9a, C-8, C-7, C-6, C-5a and C-5. Based on the above evidence, compound 2 could be defined as 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2- hydroxypropan-2-yl)-11-methoxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-b] acridin-5(10H)-one. Table 2 shows 1H, 13C NMR data for 2 and the correlations observed in the HMBC. Compound 3 was isolated as an amorphous powder, the molecular formula was determined as C20H21NO6 by HRESIMS, showing an [M + H]+ peak at m/z 372.1447. The UV absorption band at λmax 265, 285, 332 and 410nm, IR absorptions at νmax 3509 and 1620cm-1 and comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data characterized an acridone nucleus.16-22 The lack of a characteristic signal of hydrogen-bonded hydroxy proton in the 1H NMR spectrum, in acetone-d6 and DMSO-d6, and the shielded value of C-12 at d 177.7 in the 13C NMR spectrum suggested that there is no intramolecularly hydrogen- bonded hydroxyl group as observed for 1 and 2. The 1H NMR spectrum showed an ABX type aromatic spin system at d 7.04 (1H, t, J 7.8Hz, H-10), 7.15 (1H, dd, J 7.8, 1.5Hz, H-9) and 7.64 (1H, dd, J 7.8, 1.5Hz, H-11). The spectrum also showed one N-methyl group at d 3.65 and one O-methyl group at d 3.77. The presence of a 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyldihydropyran moiety was suggested by an oxymethine signal at d 3.88 (1H, m, H-3), two methylene protons Ha at d 3.00 (1H, dd, J 16.8, 5.7Hz, Ha-4), Hb 2.61 (1H, dd, J 16.8, 7.8Hz, Hb-4) and two methyl groups at d 1.43 (3H, s, H-1') and 1.28 (3H, s, H-2'). The resonances at d 69.1 and 78.1 in the 13C NMR spectrum supported the presence of this substituent on the acridone nucleus. In the HMBC spectrum of 3, the methylene protons at d 2.61 (H-4) showed correlations with C-4a (d103.9), C-5 (d 153.3), C-3 (d 69.1) and C-2 (d 78.1), indicating that the substituent was located at an angular position. This spectrum also showed the correlation of the N-methyl protons at d 3.65 with C-6a (d 143.2) and C-7a (d 137.1). The O-methyl protons at d 3.77 showed correlation with C-6 at d 130.4; this value is consistent with an acridone having an O-methyl group in this position.17,23 Correlations of H-9, H-10 and H-11 allowed the assignments of the carbons C-8, C-8a, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-11a and C-12. Therefore, compound 3 was identified as 3,4-dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy- 2,2,7-trimethyl-2H-pyrano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)- one. Table 3 shows the data of 1H, 13C NMR and the correlation observed in the HMBC. The eleven acridone alkaloids isolated from S. glutinosa were tested for in vitro activity against P. falciparum, T. b. rhodesiense and L. donovani. An assay with KB cells indicated in vitro cytotoxicity. The results are summarized in Table 4. To facilitate the discussion, IC50 values were assigned as IC50 T,P,K against T. b. rhodesiense, P. falciparum and KB cells, respectively. Nine out of the eleven acridone alkaloids showed IC50 P below 10 µM, four showed IC50 T below 10 µM and none displayed significant activity against L. donovani. Related acridone alkaloids from Thamnosma rodesica (Bak. F.), showed activity against promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania major.

Antiparasitic Activities of Acridone Alkaloids from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 648 alkaloids have a methyl 2,3-dihydroxypropanoate chain at C-3 and C-4,23 indicating that the substitution in the acridone skeleton is important for activity in this class of compounds. According to the data, compound 5, with one prenyl group at C-2, was the most active against P. falciparum with ICP 50 0.3 µM. Comparison of 5, 1 (ICP 50 2.6 µM) and 4 (ICP 50 2.6 µM) indicates that the second prenyl at C-8 was responsible for reducing the activity of this series. This fact was also observed by Weniger et al.,10 who performed the assay with four alkaloids from S. glutinosa on a Nigerian chloroquine-sensitive strain of P. falciparum. Analysis of the results for compounds 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11 suggests that the presence of a pyran ring is important for activity against P. falciparum and the position of this group, angular pyrano[2,3-c] (9) or linear pyrano[3,2-b] (10), did not alter the results of ICP 50. The activity against P. falciparum observed for 6, 7 and 8, ICP 50 8.9, 29.9 and 6.1 µM, respectively, shows that presence of an O-methyl group at C-2 improves the activity. From the 11 alkaloids tested against T. b. rhodesiense, compound 9 was the most active with an ICT 50 1.0 µM. Alkaloids 1-3 had their citotoxicity to cancer cells described in an earlier paper,30 however here we disclose for the first time their isolation, spectral data and structure elucidation.

IR spectra were recorded on a Bomem M-B Series spectrophotometer. UV absorptions were recorded using a Varian 500 SCAN UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. 1H and 13C NMR data were recorded on Bruker ARX-200 and Bruker DRX-400 spectrometers. Spectra were recorded in acetone-d6 and DMSO-d6 with TMS as internal standard. All 2D NMR data were recorded at 400MHz (Bruker DRX-400), HSQC J 145 Hz; HMBC J 8 Hz. HR-MS data were recorded on a Micromass Q-Tof (QqTOF) spectrometer; column chromatography was on silica gel 60 (Merck) and Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia). Preparative HPLC was performed on a Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G column. TLC was carried out using Merck aluminum-backed silica gel 60 F254. Plant material Leaves, stem and root bark were collected in Campinas (SP) at the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, and dried in the shade. The plant was identified by Prof. Dr. Maria Inês Salgado. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of the Departamento de Botânica of the Universidade Federal de São Carlos (HUFSCar) as number 7110. Extraction and isolation The parts of the plant were extracted separately with n-hexane at room temperature for 3 days, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 oC. This procedure was repeated 3 times to yield the crude hexane extract. The residue was extracted, as above, using MeOH to yield the crude MeOH extract. The crude MeOH extract (60 g) was fractioned by VCC over 1 kg of silica gel 60 (70-239 mesh, Merck) eluted with 1.5 L of the solvents: 100% hexane (fraction 1), 100% CH2Cl2 (fraction 2), 3:1 CH2Cl2:MeOH (fraction 3); 2:1 CH2Cl2:MeOH (fraction 4); 1:1 CH2Cl2:MeOH (fraction 5) and 100% MeOH (fraction 5).

(Rutaceae) levou ao isolamento de alcalóides furoquinolínicos (dictamina, g-fagarina e esquimianina) e 2-arilquinolin- 4-ona (2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona) e limonóides (ácido limonéxico e limonina). Os compostos 2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona e ácido limonéxico foram isolados pela primeira vez no gênero Spiranthera. Os alcalóides furoquinolínicos, 2-arilquinolin-4-ona e os limonóides mostraram atividade inseticida e/ou fungicida no ninho da formiga Atta sexdens rubropilosa. The study of the Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil (Rutaceae) branches extracts led to the isolation of the furoquinoline (dictamine, g-fagarine and skimmianine) and 2-arylquinoli-4-one (1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one) alkaloids and limonoids (limonexic acid and limonin). The compounds 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one and limonexic acid were isolated for the first time from the Spiranthera. These furoquinoline and 2-arylquinoli-4-one alkaloids and limonoids showed insecticidal and/or fungicidal activity in the nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Keywords: Spiranthera odoratissima, furoquinoline alkaloids, limonoids, Atta sexdens rubropilosa, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus Introduction Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae), popularly know as Manacá, is a shrub found in the savannah and forest of Central Brazil, and in Bolivia.1 In folk medicine is used in the treatment of rheumatism, gout, kidney infections, urinary retention, abdominal pains, acne and boil.2 According to Matos et al.,3 the ethanolic extract of the S. odoratissima roots contain compounds with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. In previous phytochemical studies of S. odoratissima roots and leaves were reported to contain furoquinoline and b-indoloquinazoline alkaloids, coumarin, terpene, steroid and limonoids.4-5 Leaf-cutting ants (Hymenoptera) are dominant herbivores in the tropics and can be found from the United States Southern to Northern Argentina countries.6 They cultivate a symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, thus they are considering plague.7 Therefore, the biological control of these insects has been the aim of many studies. In this work was determined the toxicity of crude extract and compounds isolated from S. odoratissima branches in nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlations spectra were obtained using Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, with CDCl3 and acetone-d6 using TMS as internal standard. Terezan et al. 883 Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010 For ESIMS analysis, low resolution, was used on triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument. GC/MS (EI) analysis was used a QP5000 Shimadzu, capillary column DB 5MS (30 m, 0.25 mm id, film 0.25 mm). The temperature was programmed initially at 70 °C for 4 min, them increased with a rate of 10 °C min-1 to 280 °C respectively, injection volume was 1 mL in a split mode and temperatures of the detector/ injector were 300 /280 °C. The mass selective detector at 70eV with scans from 50 to 500 u. Plant material Branches of S. odoratissima were collected in Rio Verde-Jataí, GO, Brazil in January/2001 and identified by Dr. José Rubens Pirani. Voucher specimens (4778) were deposited at the Institute of Bioscience herbarium of the University of São Paulo. Compounds extraction and isolation The dried and powdered branches (1.1 kg) were subsequently extracted with n-hexane (1.9 g), CH2Cl2 (7.2 g) and MeOH (16.7 g). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH gradient. The CH2Cl2-EtOAc fraction (4.1 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluting with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient to give 3 fractions A-C. Fraction A (34.4 mg) was fractionated as above, n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient. The fraction A-1 (15.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane- CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding 1 (7.8 mg). Fraction B (689.3 mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient yielding 26 fractions. The fraction B-15 (37.0mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding 2 (8.7 mg). Fraction B-16 (210.1 mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (3.5:6:0.5) and yielded 32 fractions. The fraction B-16.27 (44.5 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (0.5:4:0.5) yielding 3 (7.4 mg). Fraction C (2.1 g) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 70 fractions. The fraction C-34 (397.5mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient and fraction C-34.86 was purified by preparative TLC using CH2Cl2-acetone (4:1) and yielded 4 (18.0 mg). Fraction C-67 (40.4 mg) was fractionated by TLC using CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:3) yielding 5 (5.0 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was submitted to liquid partition with n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The union of the n-hexane and CH2Cl2 fractions (510.0 mg) was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH, MeOH-CH2Cl2 (4:1, 3:2 and 1:1) to give 38 frations. Fraction 22 (89.0 mg) was submitted to centrifugational chromatography (Cromatroton) using n-hexane-CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 10 fractions. Fraction 22-2 (20.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (1:8:1) and yielded 6 (16.0 mg). Identification of the isolated compounds The isolated compounds were identified using NMR, MS techniques. The furoquinoline alkaloids, dictamine (1), g-fagarine (2) and skimmianine (3) presented spectral data in agreement with the literature.8-9 1-Methyl-2- phenylquinolin-4-one (4)10: Amorphous solid, EIMS m/z (rel. int. %) [M+] 235 (100), 207 (71), 178 (6), 165 (11), 102 (19), 89 (9), 77 (17), 51 (11).

Fungicidal bioassay The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Singer) Möller (syn Rozites gongylophorus) was isolated from an Atta sexdens rubropilosa laboratory nest. The medium for fungus maintenance and methods for the bioassays were previously described.12 Solvent (n-hexane or dichloromethane or methanol) or solution of each extract or solution of compounds (1.0 mL) were added to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose (10.0), sodium chloride (5.0), peptone (5.0), malt extract (10.0) and agar (15.0). Control tubes received 1.0mL of solvent and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes were autoclaved at 121 °C by 15 min and then slanted. The final concentration of n-hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts were 1000 µg mL-1 and of the compounds 1, 2 and 3 were 50 µg mL-1. The fungal suspension was prepared by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1.0gL-1) and gently fragmented. This suspension (1.0 mL) was spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at 25 (±1) °C for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two sets of five tubes each). Fungal growth was estimated macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and density using the modal value. Leaf-cutting ant insecticide biossay The A. sexdens rubropilosa workers used in the assays were randomly removed from laboratory nests. They had Activities of Extracts and Compounds from Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 884 a body mass of 20-25 mg. Before the assays the nests were supplied daily with leaves of Eucalyptus sp., oat seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such as Hibiscussp., Ligustrum sp. or rose petals. Fifty ants were removed from the nests and put into five Petri dishes (ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assay the ants were maintained on an artificial diet prepared with glucose (50.0g L-1), bacto-peptone (10.0 g L-1), yeast extract (1.0gL-1), and agar (15.0 g L-1), in distilled water (100mL).13 The diet (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of compounds (experiment) or without (control) were offered daily in a small plastic cap. The control was prepared with the diet and the solvent. To ensure that undetectable remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants, a comparison made with another set of dishes in which water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not shown). The compounds were poured into the hot diet immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration of the extracts added to the diet were 2000 mg mL-1 and of the compounds 100 mg mL-1 or 500mg mL-1. During the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at a temperature 25(±1)°C and relative humidity ranging between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation was 25 days and number of dead ants was registered daily. The survival median 50% (S50) was calculated and survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted software Graph-Pad™ using the log-rank test. Results and Discussion The compounds isolated from dichloromethane crude extract of the S. odoratissima branches were dictamine8 (1), g-fagarine9 (2), skimmianine8 (3), 1-methyl-2- phenylquinolin-4-one (4), limonexic acid (5) and limonin (6) (Figure 1). The 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4) and limonexic acid (5) were isolated for the first time from the Spiranthera. Compounds 1-3 were identified by comparison of NMR spectral data with those described in the literature,8,9 and the structures of compounds 4, 5 and 6 were confirmed on the basis of 1H NMR, EIMS and ESIMS spectra, and carbon attributions that were made by HSQC and HMBC correlation spectra. The S. odoratissima branches crude extracts showed high inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present insecticidal activity on A. sexdens rubropilosa ants. The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol crude extract (1000 mg mL-1) showed 100% of inhibitory activity on symbiotic fungus (L. gongylophorus). The activities of compounds 1-3 were comparable to those of extracts above. However, 1 and 2 were more fungicide than 3, the two first inhibiting fungus growths at 100% and the later 80%. The compounds 4, 5 and 6, were not tested in this bioassay. These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids are the potentially active compounds in the fungicidal bioassay of dichloromethane crude extract. The fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids skimmianine, kokusaginine, maculine, dictamine, flindersiamine and quinolone obtained from Rutaceae family,10,14 already had been described in literature as powerful inhibitors of symbiotic fungus growth. The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic extracts were tested in ants (A. sexdens rubropilosa) ingestion bioassay (Table 1) and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present insecticidal activity. In contrast with high fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids against the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ants, the ingestion bioassay showed that compounds 1 and 2 showed weak activity in ants ingestion assay, which had S50 ranging from 11.0 and 14.0, respectively, while in the control S50 was 15.0. Only compound 1 presented statistic difference in comparison with control (Table 2), according to the log- rank test (p < 0.05), which considered all tested period. Compound 3 was tested in previous work15 and showed not be toxic to the leaf-cutting ants. Compounds 4-6 isolated from dichloromethane and methanolic extracts showed toxicity against leaf-cutting ants (Table 3).

For limonexic acid (5), the most potent compound, at concentration of 500 mg mL-1, the survival median (S50) of the ants were in the 3rd day of the experiment and 98% mortality occurred at the 17th day. This latter result was also observed by Biavatti et al.16 Therefore, these results indicate that the compounds 4-6 are potentially active compounds against A. sexdens rubropilosa. The potential insecticidal and fungicidal activities of the S. odoratissima extracts and of the compounds isolated from the dichloromethane and methanolic extracts suggest the use of this plant in the nest of the leaf-cutting ants control, and the continuation of the investigation of the S.odoratissima bioactive compounds.

Ela pode ocorrer durante todo o ciclo de desenvolvimento da cultura, independentemente do período em que o tomate seja cultivado (França & Castelo Branco 1992). Suas larvas minadoras alimentam-se inicialmente do mesoﬁ lo foliar, construindo galerias transparentes, podendo também broquear o caule, perfurar o broto terminal, daniﬁ car ﬂ ores e frutos. Estes, além de terem a polpa destruída, ﬁ cam mais suscetíveis à penetração de microrganismos, tornando- se, na maioria das vezes, inviáveis à comercialização (Castelo Branco 1992, Souza & Reis 1992). O controle de T. absoluta é principalmente químico, caracterizado por aplicações sucessivas de inseticidas, chegando, em alguns casos, a 36 pulverizações por cultivo CROP PROTECTION Bioatividade de Moléculas Isoladas de Trichilia pallida Swartz (Meliaceae) sobre Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) UEMERSON S.

DIC leaf extracts of T. pallida yielded six compounds, the triterpenes 24-methylenecycloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1), 24-methylenecycloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2) and cycloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3), the sterols 24-methylene-3,22-dihydroxycholesterol (EST-1), 24-methylenecholesterol (EST-2) and 24-methylene-3E,4E,22-trihydroxycholesterol (EST-3), while the fruit extract yielded the limonoid gedunine (LIM). These molecules were dissolved in acetone and sprayed at 0.1% on tomato leaﬂ ets infested with newly-hatched larvae. Larval mortality at day 5 and 9 after infestation, larval and pupal developmental time and survival, pupal weight and adult malformation were evaluated. TRIT-1, EST-1 and LIM were the most effective against T. absoluta due to larval development arrestment and reduced larval survivorship. KEY WORDS: Lycopersicon esculentum, botanical insecticide, natural product, control, tomato leafminer RESUMO - A partir do extrato em diclorometano (DIC) de folhas e frutos de Trichilia pallida Swartz, objetivou-se fazer o isolamento e identiﬁ cação de substâncias com atividade inseticida sobre a traça- do-tomateiro, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick). Do extrato em DIC de folhas de T. pallida foram isolados os triterpenos 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1), 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2) e cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3), os esteróides 24-metileno-3,22-diidroxicolesterol (EST-1), 24- metilenocolesterol (EST-2) e 24-metileno-3E,4E,22-triidroxicolesterol (EST-3), além do limonóide gedunina (LIM) obtido de frutos da planta. As substâncias foram dissolvidas em acetona e pulverizadas a 0,1% em folíolos de tomateiro infestados com lagartas recém-eclodidas. Foram avaliadas a mortalidade de lagartas aos quinto e nono dias após a infestação, duração e sobrevivência das fases de larva e pupa, peso de pupas e porcentagem de adultos deformados. TRIT-1, EST-1 e LIM foram as moléculas que apresentaram maior atividade sobre T. absoluta, alongando o desenvolvimento larval e reduzindo a sobrevivência dessa fase. PALAVRAS-CHAVE: Lycopersicon esculentum, inseticida botânico, produto natural, controle, traça-do-tomateiro 710 Cunha et al. - Bioatividade de Moléculas Isoladas de Trichilia pallida Swartz (Meliaceae) sobre Tuta absoluta... (Picanço et al. 1995). Apesar disso, de modo geral, não se tem obtido a eficácia desejada devido à seleção de populações resistentes aos princípios ativos empregados (Siqueira et al. 2000, Lietti et al. 2005) e à eliminação de populações de inimigos naturais da traça (Miranda et al. 2005). Somados a esses problemas, estão os referentes a intoxicações de produtores e de consumidores pelos resíduos dos agrotóxicos utilizados, contaminação do ambiente e alto custo de produção (França & Castelo Branco 1992, Souza & Reis 1992, Guedes et al. 1994, Picanço et al. 1995). Assim, é primordial a disponibilização e adoção de medidas que contribuam de maneira a tornar eﬁ caz, viável econômica e ambientalmente, para o controle da traça T. absoluta. Uma das alternativas do manejo integrado da traça-do- tomateiro é o uso de espécies de plantas da família Meliaceae, fonte de substâncias com atividade inseticida. Inúmeras pesquisas foram desenvolvidas com o intuito de identiﬁ car possíveis efeitos inseticidas dessas plantas, principalmente Azadirachta indica A. Juss, comumente denominada nim, que apresenta, entre outros compostos, o limonóide azadiractina. Além dessa planta, outras, do gênero Trichilia, que contém aproximadamente 230 espécies, distribuídas principalmente na América Tropical, vêm sendo apontadas como promissoras por possuírem substâncias com atividade inseticida comparável à da azadiractina (Mikolajczak & Reed 1987, Xie et al. 1994, Ramírez et al. 2000, Wheeler et al. 2001). No Brasil, em trabalhos visando selecionar espécies de meliáceas com atividade sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), destacou-se Trichilia pallida Swartz, (Rodríguez & Vendramim 1996, 1997, Roel & Vendramim 1999, Roel et al. 2000a, b, Bogorni & Vendramim 2005). Aliado à bioatividade encontrada está o fato de essa espécie vegetal, além de ser nativa do Brasil, estar amplamente distribuída geograﬁ camente (Klein 1984), permitindo prever que tais plantas, partes destas, ou até mesmo substâncias isoladas das mesmas, têm potencial para emprego no controle de pragas. Diversas pesquisas já foram conduzidas para avaliar o efeito de extratos de Meliaceae sobre a traça-do-tomateiro T. absoluta (Thomazini et al. 2000, Trindade et al. 2000, Brunherotto & Vendramim 2001, Vendramim & Thomazini 2001, Gonçalves-Gervásio & Vendramim 2007) sem, no entanto, terem como objetivo isolar e avaliar a atividade inseticida de substâncias de tais plantas. Em pesquisas recentes, Cunha et al. (2005, 2006) identiﬁ caram a partir de extratos de folhas de T. pallida e Trichilia pallens C. DC., respectivamente, frações com maior potencial inseticida sobre T. absoluta. Nesse sentido, objetivou-se neste trabalho avaliar a bioatividade de substâncias isoladas de T. pallida, a partir do que foi desenvolvido por Cunha et al. (2005), sobre T. absoluta. Material e Métodos O processo de isolamento de moléculas bioativas de T. pallida e as características das moléculas isoladas, são apresentados por Rocha (2004). Os bioensaios foram realizados a 25 r 2oC, UR de 60 r 10% e fotofase de 14h. A criação de T. absoluta foi feita de acordo com método adaptado de Pratissoli (1995) em folíolos de tomateiro cv. Santa Clara cultivado em estufa. As várias etapas, que culminaram com a seleção do extrato em diclorometano de folhas de T. pallida como o de maior potencial de apresentar substâncias com atividade sobre T. absoluta, foram detalhadamente descritas por Cunha et al. (2005), diferindo no que se refere ao extrato de frutos em diclorometano. Efeito de substâncias de T. pallida sobre T. absoluta. Os bioensaios foram conduzidos seguindo delineamento inteiramente casualizado com seis repetições e nove tratamentos, testando sete substâncias a 0,1% [24- metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1); 24-metilenocicloarta- 3E-26-diol (TRIT-2); cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3); 24-metileno-3,22-diidroxicolesterol (EST-1); 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2); 24-metileno-3E,4E,22- triidroxicolesterol (EST-3) e gedunina (LIM)], acrescidas dos controles acetona e água. Dada a importância de se avaliar o efeito do limonóide gedunina sobre T. absoluta, embora o mesmo tenha sido obtido sem bio-monitoramento do extrato em diclorometano de frutos, foi incluído nos bioensaios juntamente com as demais substâncias isoladas a partir do extrato em diclorometano de folhas. Incluiu-se a acetona como controle em virtude de ter sido este o solvente utilizado para as referidas moléculas. As substâncias foram aplicadas em folíolos de tomateiro por meio de um miniatomizador de acordo com Cunha et al. (2005, 2006). A ﬁ m de manter a turgescência dos folíolos, seus pecíolos foram envolvidos com algodão hidróﬁ lo, umedecido diariamente. Em cada folíolo, sendo três por repetição, foram liberadas seis lagartas recém-eclodidas, totalizando 108 indivíduos por tratamento. Depois de infestados, os folíolos foram transferidos para placas plásticas (6 cm de diâmetro) onde permaneceram até nove dias após a infestação (DAI). Decorrido esse período, as lagartas remanescentes foram transferidas para folíolos de tomateiro não-tratados, preparados conforme descrito anteriormente, sendo avaliada diariamente a mortalidade de lagartas até a formação de pupas. As pupas eram então retiradas dos folíolos e transferidas, individualmente, para tubos de vidro (2,5 cm de diâmetro e 8,5 cm de altura) para a determinação do sexo após 24h. Foram avaliados os seguintes parâmetros: mortalidade de lagartas (%) ao quinto e nono DAI, duração (dias) e sobrevivência (%) da fase larval, peso de pupas (mg), duração (dias) e sobrevivência (%) da fase de pupa e adultos deformados (%). Análise Estatística. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância (ANOVA), sendo as médias comparadas pelo teste de Duncan (P d 0,05). Quando necessário, os dados foram transformados com base em teste (Hartley) para avaliação da homocedasticidade de variâncias. Resultados e Discussão Moléculas isoladas de T. pallida. A partir do extrato em diclorometano de folhas de T. pallida foram isoladas seis November - December 2008 Neotropical Entomology 37(6) 711 moléculas, sendo três triterpenóides (TRIT) e três esteróides (EST) (Fig. 1). A outra molécula, identiﬁ cada como sendo o limonóide (LIM) gedunina, foi obtida do extrato em diclorometano de frutos (Fig. 1). Efeito das moléculas isoladas sobre T. absoluta. As mortalidades de lagartas de T. absoluta observadas aos 5 DAI para 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1) e gedunina (LIM) (16,8 e 15,4 % respectivamente) superaram aquelas registradas para 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2), 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2), 24-metileno-3E,4E,22- triidroxicolesterol (EST-3) e cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3) (Tabela 1). O esteróide 24-metileno-3,22- diidroxicolesterol (EST-1), embora não tenha ocasionado mortalidade signiﬁ cativa, foi o único tratamento, aos 5 DAI, que não diferiu do triterpenóide TRIT-1 e do limonóide LIM. Aos 9 DAI, à semelhança do observado aos 5 DAI, apenas HO 24-metilenocolesterol (EST-2) HO OH OH 24-metileno-3ȕ,4ȕ,22-triidroxicolesterol (EST-3) O OAc O O O O Gedunina (LIM) HO OH OH 24-metileno-3,22-diidroxicolesterol (EST-1) cicloarta-23-eno-3E,25-diol (TRIT-3) HO HO 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1) HO OH 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol (TRIT-2) Fig. 1. Moléculas isoladas a partir do extrato de T. pallida em diclorometano. 712 Cunha et al. - Bioatividade de Moléculas Isoladas de Trichilia pallida Swartz (Meliaceae) sobre Tuta absoluta... as substâncias LIM (20,9 %) e TRIT-1 (19,6 %) diferiram dos controles acetona (7,2 %) e água (3,9 %), sendo que EST-1, além de não diferir de TRIT-1 e LIM, também ocasionou mortalidade de lagartas superior à do controle água (Tabela 1). Além disso, de 5 DAI para 9 DAI, observou-se um incremento na mortalidade de lagartas de 77,4% para EST-1, enquanto que para TRIT-1 e LIM os incrementos foram de 16,7% e 35,7%, respectivamente. Assim, pode-se inferir que o efeito tóxico causado às lagartas pelo esteróide EST-1 pode ser crônico, levando maior tempo para ocasionar a morte do inseto em relação a TRIT-1 e LIM. TRIT-1, LIM e EST-1, além de terem sido responsáveis pelos maiores valores de mortalidade de lagartas de T. absoluta aos 5 DAI e 9 DAI, também ocasionaram maior duração da fase larval (Tabela 2). A duração dessa fase para os tratamentos com LIM e EST-1 foi de 15,2 e 14,9 dias respectivamente, diferindo dos controles acetona (13,5 dias) e água (12,8 dias), sendo que para TRIT-1 (14,3 dias), houve diferença apenas em relação ao controle com água (Tabela 2). Além disso, LIM e EST-1 ocasionaram sobrevivência larval (67,3% e 65,0% respectivamente) inferior àquelas registradas nos controles acetona (85,6%) e água (92,5%), sendo que TRIT-1 também reduziu a sobrevivência (74,5%); porém, apenas em relação ao controle com água (Tabela 2). Segundo Rodríguez & Vendramim (1996), é interessante que haja prolongamento da fase larval, pois, em condições de campo, o inseto ﬁ caria por mais tempo propenso ao ataque de inimigos naturais, gerando ainda assincronia entre os adultos dessa população em relação aos indivíduos da população normal. Assim, o triterpenóide TRIT-1, o limonóide LIM e o esteróide EST-1, além de apresentarem efeito tóxico sobre lagartas de T. absoluta, caracterizado pelos maiores índices de mortalidade (Tabela 1), possivelmente também tenham exercido efeito fagodeterrente, que teria, por sua vez, prolongado a fase larval e reduzido a sobrevivência dessa fase (Tabela 2). Além desses efeitos, lagartas alimentadas em folíolos tratados com o triterpenóide TRIT-1 apresentaram alterações possivelmente relacionadas ao sistema endócrino, uma vez que algumas lagartas não conseguiram se livrar completamente da exúvia, o que ocasionou o anelamento do abdome do inseto, impedindo-o de se alimentar e de se locomover, ocorrendo então a morte por ocasião da ecdise (Fig. 2), assim como observado para S. frugiperda (Roel et al. 2000b). Os efeitos causados pelo triterpenóide TRIT-1 em T. absoluta e os citados por Roel et al. (2000b) foram igualmente observados em outras espécies de insetos e atribuídos ao tetranortriterpenóide (limonóide) azadiractina, principal substância com atividade inseticida do nim (Martinez & van Emden 2001, Mordue (Luntz) & Blackwell 1993, Mordue (Luntz) & Nisbet 2000). Pode-se, pois, inferir que 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-ol (TRIT-1) tenha atuado de forma semelhante à azadiractina, reduzindo, provavelmente, a concentração de ecdisônio na hemolinfa, levando o inseto à morte pela incapacidade de se livrar da exúvia (Fig. 2). Apesar dos efeitos observados em relação à fase larval, TRIT-1, LIM e EST-1 não afetaram a duração e sobrevivência da fase pupal, bem como o peso de pupas fêmeas e machos em relação aos controles (acetona e água) (Tabela 3). Resultados semelhantes foram observados por Rodríguez & Vendramim (1996), que, ao avaliarem o efeito de extratos aquosos de diferentes estruturas vegetais de 11 espécies de Meliaceae sobre S. frugiperda, constataram que os parâmetros relacionados à fase de larva foram mais afetados que os da fase de pupa.

No entanto, estas não reduziram o consumo de alimento, o que reﬂ etiu em pupas com pesos equivalentes àquelas dos controles (Tabela 3). Acrescendo-se a isso, o peso de pupas fêmeas (Tabela 3) formadas a partir de lagartas alimentadas em folíolos tratados com TRIT-1, foi superior às do controle (água). Esse resultado, em princípio contraditório, uma vez que a referida substância causou as maiores mortalidades de lagartas aos 5 DAI e 9 DAI (Tabela 1), prolongou a fase de larva e reduziu sua sobrevivência (Tabela 2), pode ser decorrente de uma possível seleção, de maneira que apenas os indivíduos mais vigorosos (com maior peso), e portanto mais aptos a atingir a fase adulta, teriam sobrevivido (Vendramim & Scampini 1997). Outrossim, como se pode observar na Tabela 3, houve maior sobrevivência da fase de pupa para EST-1 em relação a EST-2. Esse resultado também parece contraditório, uma vez que o esteróide EST-1 ocasionou maior mortalidade de lagartas aos 9 DAI comparada aos controles (acetona e água), prolongou a fase larval e reduziu de maneira signiﬁ cativa a sobrevivência dessa fase. No entanto, de maneira similar ao observado com o peso de pupas fêmeas envolvendo TRIT-1 e o controle (água) (Tabela 3), possivelmente também possa ter ocorrido seleção dos indivíduos mais aptos, segundo Vendramim & Scampini (1997).

Para esse parâmetro, como houve grande variabilidade entre as diferentes repetições, caracterizada pelo maior desvio (EP) em relação às médias de tratamentos, o que confere baixa precisão. Ao se avaliarem os resultados, é conveniente se considerar em trabalhos futuros um maior número de indivíduos a ﬁ m de que a variabilidade observada seja minimizada. Similarmente, Bogorni & Vendramim (2005), ao avaliarem o efeito de extratos aquosos de folhas e ramos de várias espécies de Trichilia spp., observaram grande variação para o percentual de adultos de S. frugiperda deformados, sem constatar, no entanto, a ocorrência de diferenças signiﬁ cativas para esse parâmetro. Com base nos resultados encontrados, conclui-se que das substâncias isoladas a partir do extrato em diclorometano de T. pallida (a 0,1 %), o triterpeno 24- metilenocicloarta-3E-ol e o esteróide 24-metileno-3,22- diidroxicolesterol, ambos de folhas, juntamente com o limonóide gedunina de frutos, apresentam maior atividade inseticida sobre lagartas de T. absoluta que as substâncias 24-metilenocicloarta-3E-26-diol; 24-metileno-colesterol; 24-metileno-3E,4E,22-triidroxicolesterol e cicloarta-23-eno- 3E,25-diol. Além do mais, o triterpeno 24-metilenocicloarta- 3E-ol, o limonóide gedunina e o esteróide 24-metileno-3,22- diidroxicolesterol prolongam o desenvolvimento larval e reduzem a sobrevivência larval, mas não afetam a duração, a sobrevivência e o peso de pupas de T. absoluta.

Pupo∗ Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Av. do Café, s/n, 14040-903 Ribeirão Preto – SP, Brasil Recebido em 1/10/07; aceito em 7/5/08; publicado na web em 19/9/08 CHAETOGLOBOSINS PRODUCED BY Chaetomium globosum, ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS FOUND IN ASSOCIATION WITH Viguiera robusta Gardn (ASTERACEAE). Endophytes live in association with host plants during all or part of their life cycle without causing any apparent disease. They are considered outstanding and underexploited sources of novel bioactive compounds. Chaetomium globosum was isolated as an endophytic fungus from the healthy leaves of Viguiera robusta. C. globosum is a remarkable producer of chaetoglobosins, which are typically cytotoxic. In this work, chaetoglobosins B (1), D (2) and E (3) have been produced by the endophytic C. globosum strain. Chaetoglobosin B was evaluated against Jurkat (leukemia) and B16F10 (melanoma) tumoral cells and showed 89.55% and 57.10% of inhibition at 0.1 mg mL-1, respectively. Chaetoglobosin B also showed weak antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 120 µg/mL) and Escherichia coli (MIC 189 µg/mL). Keywords: chaetoglobosins; Chaetomium globosum; endophytic fungus. INTRODUÇÃO Os microrganismos endofíticos podem ser detectados em um momento particular associados aos tecidos aparentemente saudáveis de plantas hospedeiras.1 Dentre os microrganismos endofíticos os fungos são os mais comumente associados às plantas. Eles vivem nos espaços inter ou intracelulares dos tecidos das plantas durante todo ou parte de seu ciclo de vida, sem causar sintomas aparentes de doenças.2 Evidências sugerem que os fungos endofíticos possuem grande diversidade genética, implicando importância prática com relação à descoberta de novos metabólitos secundários bioativos.3 Muitos destes metabólitos possuem um grande potencial a ser utilizado na medicina, agricultura e indústria. Novos antibióticos, antimicóticos, imunossupressores e compostos anticâncer são esperados como metabólitos secundários produzidos por endofíticos.2 Os fungos endofíticos constituem uma importante e ainda pouco explorada fonte de novas substâncias químicas com poten cial biológico, portanto, devem ser considerados em programas de bioprospecção.2,4 Resultados relevantes das pesquisas sobre o metabolismo secun dário de fungos endofíticos incluem o isolamento do taxol, produ zido por Taxomyces andreanae, fungo endofítico associado a Taxus brevifolia.5 Desde então, uma variedade de fungos endofíticos tem sido reconhecida pela habilidade de produzir o taxol.6 A vincristina, outro agente antineoplásico, foi isolada de um fungo endofítico não identificado associado a Catharanthus roseus.7 Outros importantes agentes anticâncer incluem a camptotecina, obtida de Rhizopus oryzae, fungo endofítico associado a Nothapodytes foetida8 e a po dofilotoxina, produzida por Phialocephala fortinii, fungo endofítico de Podophyllum peltatum9 e também por Trametes hirusta, obtido de Podophyllum hexandrum.10 A seleção da planta hospedeira é crucial para isolamento de fun gos endofíticos e obtenção de novos compostos bioativos. A planta deve ser selecionada principalmente com base em seu próprio meio ambiente, histórico etnobotânico, endemismo, longevidade e áreas de maior biodiversidade.2 O objetivo deste trabalho foi o isolamento, a identificação e avaliação biológica das substâncias produzidas por Chaetomium globosum, fungo endofítico associado a Viguiera robusta (Astera ceae), espécie endêmica no cerrado brasileiro. O gênero Viguiera é representativo da família Asteraceae e característico na produção de lactonas sesquiterpênicas com atividade antinflamatória e diterpenos com atividade sobre músculo liso.11 Chaetomium globosum foi isolado como endofítico das folhas de V. robusta. Esta espécie caracteriza-se pela produção de citocalasanas, que apresentam diversas atividades biológicas, incluindo ação citotóxica.12-15 O cultivo de C. globosum levou ao isolamento das chaetoglobosinas B (1), D (2) e E (3). PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Procedimentos experimentais gerais Os experimentos de RMN 1D e 2D foram obtidos em espec trômetro Bruker DRX-400 operando em 400 MHz para o núcleo de 1H e 100 MHz para 13C, e em espectrômetro Bruker DRX-500 operando em 500 MHz para 1H e 125 MHz para o núcleo de 13C. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas ESI-EM Micromass Quattro LC, no modo electrospray. As análises cromatográficas por CLAE no modo analítico foram realizadas em equipamento Shimadzu SHIM-PAK com detector de arranjos de dio dos, utilizando coluna analítica CLC - ODS (M) (250 x 4,6 mm). No modo preparativo, as análises por CLAE foram realizadas no mesmo aparelho, utilizando coluna semi-preparativa VP 250/10 Nucleosil 100-5 C18 (250 x 10 mm). Nas separações em CLAE reciclante foi utilizado equipamento Shimadzu LC-GAV (UV-SPD-10AV) e coluna preparativa Shodex Asahipak GS-310 26 (500 x 15 mm). Nas sepa rações cromatográficas em coluna aberta foram utilizadas sílica gel (0,060-0,200 mm) (Merck®) e sílica gel 60 silanizada (0,063-0,200 mm) (Merck®) como fases estacionárias. Nas separações por coluna Chaetoglobosinas produzidas por Chaetomium globosum 1681 Vol. 31, No. 7 líquida a vácuo (CLV) foi utilizada sílica gel 60H (45 µm) (Merck®) como fase estacionária. Material vegetal Folhas da espécie vegetal V. robusta Gardn. (Asteraceae) foram coletadas em outubro de 2002 no canteiro de plantas do Laboratório de Farmacognosia da Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribei rão Preto – USP. Uma exsicata do material vegetal, identificado pelo Prof. Dr. J. N. Nakashima, encontra-se depositada no Herbário SPFR do Departamento de Biologia da Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras de Ribeirão Preto – USP, sob o código FBC105. Isolamento da cepa fúngica O fungo endofítico foi isolado de folhas saudáveis de V. robusta. As folhas foram lavadas em água corrente e esterilizadas por imersão em etanol 70% (3 min), NaClO 5% (5 min), novamente em etanol 70% (1 min), seguidas de lavagem em água destilada esterilizada (1 min). Após o processo de assepsia superficial, as folhas foram cortadas em pequenos pedaços de aproximadamente 0,5 cm de diâmetro, os quais foram incubados em placas de Petri com meio BDA (batata dextrose ágar), contendo o antibiótico terramicina (50 mg/mL) para evitar o crescimento de bactérias endofíticas. A espécie foi identificada através da seqüência de rDNA e é mantida em sílica gel (6–12 mesh) e slants de BDA a 4 °C no Laboratório de Enzimologia Industrial da Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto – USP. Identificação do microrganismo O fungo foi crescido em meio líquido YPD (1% de extrato de levedura, 2% de peptona, 2% de dextrose) em mesa agitadora shaker (72 h, 30 °C, 120 rpm), sendo então filtrado a vácuo, congelado em nitrogênio líquido e estocado a –70 °C. O DNA genômico foi isolado utilizando a técnica de extração fenol-clorofórmio e então diluído em 100 µL de água esterilizada e 1 µL da solução de DNA foi utilizada para o procedimento de amplificação. O DNA foi quantificado por espectrofotometria por leitura da absorbância entre 260-280 nm. A amplificação dos produtos foi verificada em gel de agarose a 1%. O par de primers ITS3 e ITS4 foi utilizado para amplificar a porção maior de rDNA 5.8S e a região ITS2 adjacente. A amplificação por PCR foi realizada com um volume de 50 µL. Um µL do DNA genô mico (500 ng), 2,5 µL de dNTP 4 mM, 0,5 µL de 5U de Amplitaq platinum Taq polimerase por µL e 5 µL de tampão 10X (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8,3], 2 µL de MgCl2 50 mM, 1 µL de primers universais ITS3 e ITS 4 [21 pM] e 37 µL de água destilada). A amplificação foi completada num termociclo sob as seguintes condições: 94 °C por 2 min, seguido por 35 ciclos de 94 °C por 1 min, 54 °C por 1 min, 72 °C por 1 min e uma etapa final de 72 °C por 10 min. Os produtos de PCR foram purificados em coluna Qiagen. A análise da seqüência inteira de DNA do produto de PCR obtido com os primers universais de fungo ITS3 e ITS4 específicos para genes de rDNA foi realizada para confirmar a identificação da espécie. Foi então realizado o se qüenciamento automático em ambas as direções usando um primer de amplificação inicial e a seqüência alinhada de DNA resultante foi analisada com o software Sequencher. A comparação da seqüência isolada foi realizada com a seqüência presente no GenBank, utilizando busca avançada de BLAST.16 Cultivo do microrganismo e obtenção dos extratos brutos C. globosum foi repicado em 13 placas de Petri contendo meio BDA e incubado por 7 dias a 30 oC. A cultura fermentativa foi reali zada em duas etapas. Inicialmente, 3 fragmentos de ágar de aproxi madamente 0,5 cm de diâmetro foram transferidos das placas de Petri para cada um dos 13 frascos de Erlenmeyers (1 L) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo pré-fermentativo seed,17 os quais foram mantidos em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 30 °C por 48 h. Posteriormente, a massa micelial obtida foi filtrada em ambiente asséptico e transferida para 13 frascos de Erlenmeyers (2 L) contendo 400 mL de meio de cultivo Czapek,18 os quais foram incubados em mesa agitadora por 144 h, a 120 rpm e 30 °C. Ambos os meios de cultivo foram previamente submetidos à esterilização em autoclave a 121 °C e 1 atm de pressão por 15 min. Após o término do cultivo, a cultura foi filtrada a vácuo em funil de Büchner e o fluido da cultura foi submetido à partição líquido-líquido com AcOEt. A evaporação do solvente forneceu 600,0 mg do extrato bruto acetoetílico (CGLA). Isolamento dos constituintes químicos O extrato bruto CGLA (600,0 mg) foi submetido a uma CLV, utilizando-se como fase estacionária sílica gel 60H e como fases móveis hexano 100%, hexano-AcOEt 19:1, 9:1, 17:3, 4:1, 7:3, 1:1, 3:7, 1:4, 1:9, 1:19 (v/v), AcOEt 100%, MeOH-AcOEt 1:1 (v/v) e MeOH 100% (150 mL cada fração), fornecendo 14 sub-frações. A sub-fração CGLA9 (250,0 mg) foi submetida a uma coluna aberta utilizando-se como fase estacionária sílica gel silanizada e como fase móvel acetona-água (1:1), fornecendo na sub-fração 5 a substância 1 (25,2 mg). A sub-fração CGLA10 (72,0 mg) foi também submetida à coluna aberta sob as mesmas condições, fornecendo 8 sub-frações. As subfrações CGLA10.4 (19,7 mg) e CGLA10.5 (19,0 mg) foram submetidas à CLAE reciclante em sistema isocrático MeOH 100%, fornecendo 5 e 10 sub-frações, respectivamente. Do fracionamento da sub-fração CGLA10.4 foi obtida a substância 2 (2,0 mg) e a partir da sub-fração CGLA10.5, novamente a substância 1 (2,0 mg). A sub-fração CGLA11 (79,0 mg) foi submetida à coluna aberta em sílica sinalizada, utilizando-se como fase móvel MeOH-água (1:1), fornecendo 4 sub-frações. A sub-fração 4 (54,1 mg) foi submetida à CLAE semi-preparativa, utilizando-se como fase estacionária C-18, fase móvel MeOH-H2O (1:1), vazão de 5 mL/min e λ de 225 nm, fornecendo 5 sub-frações, dentre elas a substância 3 (1,0 mg) e novamente as substâncias 1 (1,0 mg) e 2 (1,0 mg). Avaliação da atividade citotóxica A substância 1 foi submetida ao bioensaio de citotoxicidade frente às linhagens tumorais Jurkat (leucemia T) e B16F10 (melanoma). A amostra foi solubilizada em DMSO/meio RPMI (1:100) sendo este diluente utilizado como controle negativo. Como controle positivo foi utilizado o cloridrato de gencitabina. Para avaliar a atividade ci totóxica foi utilizado o método colorimétrico de citotoxicidade pelo 3-(4,5-dimetil tiazol 2-il) 2,5-difenil brometo de tetrazólio (MTT).19 A avaliação da atividade citotóxica foi determinada por espectrofo tometria, utilizando filtro de interferência de 540 nm. Determinação da concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) A concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) foi determinada pelo método de microdiluição em microplaca utilizando cloreto de trifeniltetrazólio como revelador. Foram preparadas soluções das substâncias isoladas contendo 1 mg/500 µL em DMSO. Em seguida, foram transferidos 100 µL desta solução para tubo contendo 100 µL de caldo triptona soja. Com o auxílio de uma alça de platina esterilizada, as culturas de 24 h dos microrganismos indicadores, desenvolvidas no ágar triptona soja, foram transferidas para tubos contendo 10 mL de solução salina esterilizada. Foram procedidas as diluições suces Momesso et al. 1682 Quim. Nova sivas das suspensões microbianas (Escherichia coli (ATCC25922) e Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923)) em solução salina e por fim em caldo triptona soja, de modo a fornecer um inóculo de 104 UFC/ mL. Em uma microplaca esterilizada de 96 orifícios foi aplicado um total de 100 µL da mistura do caldo triptona soja, da solução da substância 1 e das suspensões dos microrganismos. A substância 1 foi avaliada em concentrações que variaram de 400 a 1,563 µg/ mL. Foram realizados também os controles positivo, negativo e de esterilidade do meio de cultivo. As microplacas foram incubadas a 37 °C por 24 h. Posteriormente, foram adicionados em cada orifício 40 µL de cloreto de trifeniltetrazólio (Sigma®) preparado em solução aquosa (7 mg/mL). As microplacas foram reincubadas por 30 min, sendo então observado o aparecimento de cor. A ausência de cor nos orifícios foi interpretada como ausência de crescimento microbiano (microrganismo sensível à amostra testada). Foram utilizados antibi óticos padrão como controles positivos, penicilina G para S. aureus e estreptomicina para E. coli.20 RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico do extrato bruto AcOEt obtido do cultivo em Czapek produzido pelo fungo endofítico C. globosum resultou no isolamento de três citocalasanas (1-3). A identificação destas subs tâncias foi realizada com base nos dados espectroscópicos obtidos (RMN 1H e 13C, DEPT, gCOSY 1H-1H, gHMQC, gHMBC e EM) e comparação com dados disponíveis na literatura.13,23 As citocalasanas são micotoxinas que se caracterizam quimicamente pela presença de um anel peridroisoindol-1-ona altamente substituído e fundido a um anel macrocíclico (Figura 1). A natureza do substituinte em C-3 indica o aminoácido que originou a citocalasana, através da ligação com a cadeia policetídica precursora dos anéis peridroisoindol-1-ona e macrocíclico. Quando a citocalasana é biossintetizada a partir do trip tofano, a sub-classe de metabólitos é denominada chaetoglobosinas.21 Fenilalanina (originando citocalasinas) e leucina são aminoácidos que freqüentemente são também encontrados nas citocalasanas. As principais características estruturais do anel macrocíclico, em geral de 11 ou 13 membros, incluem presença de até três oxidações em C-19 (álcool ou cetona), C-20 (álcool ou cetona) e C-22 (ge ralmente cetona); presença de até três ligações duplas (∆13,14, ∆17,18, ∆21,22); presença de grupamentos metílicos em C-16 (Me-24) e C-18 (Me-25). No anel peridroisoindol-1-ona as principais modificações estruturais encontradas são presença de ligação dupla ∆5,6, ∆6,12 ou ∆6,7; presença de epóxido entre C-6 e C-7; presença de hidroxila em C-7; presença de grupamentos metílicos em C-5 (Me-11) e C-6 (Me-12). Mais de 30 chaetoglobosinas já foram isoladas e identificadas, e os dados de difração de raios-X permitiram o estabelecimento da estrutura cristalográfica das chaetoglobosinas.22 Portanto, apesar da complexidade estrutural destas substâncias, é relativamente simples identificar a classe química com base na análise dos dados de RMN 1H e 13C, e, através da comparação com os dados da literatura,13,23 estabelecer a estrutura da chaetoglobosina. A análise dos dados de RMN 1H, RMN 13C (32 sinais) e EM ([M+H]+ 529) possibilitou a proposição da fórmula molecular C32H36N2O5 para a substância 1 (IDH 16) (Figura 1). O espectro de RMN 1H apre sentou sinais característicos de chaetoglobosinas. Os sinais do anel indólico do triptofano foram observados em δ 8,25 (sl, NH); 7,51 (dl, J = 8,1 Hz, H-4’), 7,38 (dl, J = 8,1 Hz, H-7’), 7,16 (s, H-2’), 7,09 (ddd, J = 8,1; 7,8; 1,0 Hz, H-6’) e 7,01 (ddd, J = 8,1; 7,8; 1,0 Hz, H-5’). Os sinais de hidrogênios metílicos foram observados em δ 1,00 (d, J = 6,6 Hz, H-24), 1,33 (sl, H-11), 1,40 (sl, H-25) e 1,65 (sl, H-12). Os deslocamentos químicos e valores das constantes de acoplamento para os hidrogênios vinílicos em δ 7,65 (d, J = 16,4 Hz, H-22), 6,76 (d, J = 16,4 Hz, H-21), 6,18 (ddd, J = 15,4; 9,8; 1,5 Hz, H-13) e 5,18 (ddd, J = 15,4; 10,1; 3,5 Hz, H-14) indicaram a presença de duas ligações duplas com geometria E no anel macrocíclico, geralmente encontradas nas chaetoglobosinas entre C-21 e C-22 e entre C-13 e C-14. O sinal em δ 5,57 (dl, J = 8,8, H-17) evidenciou a presença de dupla ∆17,18, também comum nas chaetoglobosinas. Foram ainda observados dois sinais referentes a hidrogênios carbinólicos em δ 3,91 (dd, J = 10,6; 1,0 Hz, H-7) e 5,09 (s, H-19). O espectro de RMN 13C apresentou três sinais de carbonilas, uma referente à carbonila de amida do anel peridroisoindol-1-ona em δ 174,6 e outros dois refe rentes às carbonilas do anel macrocíclico em δ 201,0 (C-23) e 202,7 (C-20). As correlações observadas nos experimentos COSY, HMQC e HMBC permitiram a completa e inequívoca atribuição de todos os sinais de carbonos e hidrogênios da molécula. Os dados de RMN 1H e 13C da substância 1 estão de acordo com os dados publicados previamente para a chaetoglobosina B.13,14,23 As configurações relativas foram propostas com base na litera tura, a partir de dados da estrutura da chaetoglobosina A obtida por difração de raios-X.22 Os dados de RMN 1H, 13C, HMQC e HMBC para a substância 2 foram muito semelhantes aos observados para 1, que apresentou o mesmo íon molecular no EM ([M+H]+ 529). Porém, apenas três sinais referentes a grupamentos metílicos foram observados. O sinal em δ 1,65 (sl, H-12) observado para 1 está ausente no espectro de RMN 1H de 2, e dois sinais de hidrogênios vinílicos estão presentes em δ 5,30 (m, 1H) e 5,05 (m, 1H), ambos ligados ao carbono em δ 113,6, conforme correlação observada no HMQC. O sinal dos hidrogênios metílicos em δ 1,10 (d, J = 6,8 Hz) indica acoplamento com H-5 (δ 2,90, m). Estas alterações sugerem ligação dupla ∆6,12 em 2 (Figura 1). Os dados para os anéis macrocíclico e indólico foram os mesmos observados para 1. Os dados de RMN 1H e 13C obtidos para 2 estão de acordo com os dados publicados para a chaetoglobosina D.23 A substância 3 (Figura 1) também apresentou dados de RMN uni e bidimensionais compatíveis com os dados das chaetoglobosi nas. Os dados para os anéis peridroisoindol-1-ona e indólico foram compatíveis com aqueles previamente observados para a substância 1; as modificações foram observadas nos sinais referentes ao anel macrocíclico de 3. Os sinais referentes aos hidrogênios vinílicos H-21 e H-22, e respectivos carbonos, não foram observados, sugerindo redução da ligação dupla ∆21,22 em 3. Adicionalmente, a correlação observada no HMBC entre os hidrogênios metílicos H-25 (δ 1,82, d, J = 1,4 Hz) e o carbono carbonílico em δ 204,8 (C-19) sugere que em 3 a carbonila está em C-19 e o grupamento hidroxílico em C-20, originando a chaetoglobosina E. Os dados de RMN 1H obtidos para 3 estão em concordância com os dados publicados para a chaeto globosina E.14-23 Figura 1. Estrutura geral de uma chaetoglobosina com anel macrocíclico de 13 membros e das substâncias 1-3 produzidas por C. globosum Chaetoglobosinas produzidas por Chaetomium globosum 1683 Vol. 31, No. 7 Os dados de RMN 1H e 13C para as substâncias 1-3 estão apre sentados na Tabela 1. As chaetoglobosinas já foram isoladas das culturas de diversos fungos de solo, fitopatógenos, de ambiente hospitalar e de coleções comerciais, pertencentes aos gêneros Ca lonectria,24 Cylindrocladium,25 Discosia,25 Iplodia,26 Penicillium27 e Phomopsis.28 Porém, a maioria das chaetoglobosinas foi isolada de espécies de Chaetomium.29 Recentemente, as chaetoglobosinas C, F, E, e penocalasina A, além da nova chaetoglobosina U, foram também isoladas de uma cepa endofítica de C. globosum. Novas chaetoglobo sinas continuam a ser identificadas de fungos de solo29 e marinhos.30 Citocalasinas derivadas da fenilalanina foram recentemente isoladas de fungo endofítico no Brasil.31 As citocalasanas são reconhecidas por suas notáveis atividades biológicas. O nome citocalasana tem origem nas palavras gregas cytos (célula) e chalasis (relaxação) e refere-se aos efeitos celulares destas substâncias. As citocalasanas inibem o movimento e a quebra citoplas mática de células de mamíferos, efeitos atribuídos direta ou indireta mente à interação destas substâncias com a proteína actina.21,29 Há vários relatos12-15 da proeminente atividade citotóxica in vitro para as citocalasanas, o que foi experimentalmente confirmado pelo ensaio de citotoxicidade realizado com a substância 1 frente às linhagens de células tumorais Jurkat (leucemia T) e B16F10 (melanoma). A substância 1 apresentou inibições de 89,55% para a linhagem Jurkat e de 57,10% para B16F10 na concentração de 0,1 mg/mL, enquanto que nessa mesma concentração o cloridrato de gencitabina, utilizado como controle positivo, não apresentou inibição do crescimento celular. Na concentração de 0,5 mg/mL, os valores observados foram de 86,51 e 85,14% para as linhagens Jurkat e B16F10, respectivamente, enquanto que o controle positivo inibiu em 37,93 e 38,27% o crescimento celular. Já na concentração de 1,0 Tabela 1.

Nova mg/mL, enquanto o controle positivo inibiu em 41,45 e 38,87% o crescimento celular das linhagens Jurkat e B16F10, respectivamente, a substância 1 apresentou 85,30 e 81,01% de inibição. As Figuras 2 e 3 ilustram os resultados obtidos nos ensaios, que mostraram a elevada atividade citotóxica desta substância frente às células tumo rais. As chaetoglobosinas C, F, E, U, e penocalasina, isoladas de cepa endofítica de C. globosum, também apresentaram ação citotóxica na linhagem tumoral humana KB.32 Citocalasanas derivadas da fenila lanina, obtidas de fungos do gênero Phoma, também apresentaram atividade frente a células FT210 de carcinoma de rato33 e frente à linhagem tumoral humana HT29.34 A atividade antibiótica da substância 1 foi avaliada pelo método de microdiluição com a finalidade de determinar a concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) frente a S. aureus e E. coli. A substância 1 apresentou fraca atividade antibacteriana, com CIM de 120 µg/mL para S. aureus e CIM de 189 µg/mL para E. coli. A maioria das atividades biológicas descritas para as chaeto globosinas foi avaliada em modelos in vitro.12-15 Ensaios de toxi cidade experimental em modelos animais são menos numerosos, mas evidenciaram que a chaetoglobosina A apresentou toxicidade após admistração por via oral 8 vezes inferior quando comparada à admistração por via parenteral.21 As chaetoglobosinas A e C, juntamente com outras micotoxinas, agentes químicos e particulados, têm sido apontadas como respon sáveis pela diminuição da qualidade do ar em interiores, causando a “Síndrome dos Edifícios Doentes”.35 Ainda, as chaetoglobosinas A e C foram detectadas em produtos derivados de frutas27 e castanhas36 contaminados com espécies de fungos do gênero Penicillium. A elevada citotoxicidade dificulta a utilização das citocalasanas como candidatos a protótipos para o desenvolvimento de fármacos. Porém, estas substâncias são extremamente valiosas em experimentos de biologia química,37 principalmente por inibirem a divisão celular, originando células multinucleadas.13-15 CONCLUSÃO A obtenção de chaetoglobosinas reforça a hipótese de simbiose entre o fungo endofítico e a planta hospedeira, uma vez que estas substâncias bioativas poderiam auxiliar na adaptação do hospedeiro ao meio ambiente. Além disso, C. globosum parece ser um bom produtor de chaetoglobosinas, uma vez que linhagens de origem de solo, endo fíticas e de origem marinha, cultivadas em diferentes meios de cultura líquidos e sólidos, produziram substâncias desta classe. A linhagem endofítica descrita neste trabalho também produziu chaetoglobosinas quando cultivada em diferentes meios, incluindo meio sólido arroz e meio líquido de malte. Os resultados obtidos ilustram o potencial biotecnológico dos fungos endofíticos na busca por novos compostos bioativos e/ou ferramentas úteis em biologia química.

The mechanisms involved in the observed cell growth arrest of the four most potent compounds were carried out by studying their effect in cell cycle profile and programmed cell death. The results showed that one triterpene (odoratol) and two limonoids (gedunin and cedrelone) caused cell cycle arrest while only the limonoids gedunin and cedrelone were found to be very potent inducers of apoptosis. Keywords: Anticancer, apoptosis, breast adenocarcinoma, cell cycle arrest, limonoids, melanoma, non-small lung cancer, triterpenes. INTRODUCTION Cancer represents one of the most severe health problems worldwide and the development of new anticancer drugs and more effective treatment strategies are fields of utmost importance in drug discovery and clinical therapy. Based on significant advances in cancer biology, much of the research in these areas is currently focused on cancer-specific mechanisms and the corresponding mo- lecular targets [1]. Natural products have been the major sources of chemical di- versity driving pharmaceutical discovery over the past century. Many natural products and synthetically modified natural product derivatives have been successfully developed for clinical use to treat human diseases in almost all therapeutic areas [2]. In fact, plant-derived compounds have played an important role in treat- ment of cancers, and some of the most promising and effective drugs have come up from plant sources like taxol®, camptothecin, combrestatin, vinblastine and vincristine. These drugs have also been the major source of new drug candidates for cancer chemo- therapy [3]. Apart from these, many other plant-derived compounds are now in clinical trials as anticancer agents. One of the most interesting groups of plant natural products is the triterpenoid group. Over the past decade, coming to the fore- ground of interest due to their diverse biological effects are a large group of cyclic triterpenoid-like substances which comprise more than 4000 different identified compounds so far. Triterpenoids are studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, hepatoprotective, anal- gesic, antimicrobial, antimicotic, virostatic, immunomodulatory and tonic effects. They are used in prevention and treatment of hepatitis, parasitic and protozoal infection and above all, for their cytotoxic effects [4]. *Address correspondence to this author at CEQUIMED-UP - Centro de Estudos de Química Medicinal, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Aníbal Cunha 164, 4050-047 Porto, Portugal; Tel: (351) 222078916; Fax: (351) 222003977; E-mail: madalena@ff.up.pt §These authors equally contributed to this work From a biological point of view, most important triterpenoid structures are oleanane, ursane, lupane and dammarane triterpe- noids. However, in what concerns the anticancer effects, not many triterpenoid compounds have been so far studied. Among these, the lupane triterpene betulinic acid and the ursane triterpenes boswellic acid and ursolic acid have been exhaustively studied for their anti- cancer effects. Betulinic acid, which belongs to the lupane group, has been investigated intensively for its anticancer activity. Betulinic acid was found to exhibit the cytotoxic effects against human melanoma cell lines MEL-1, 2 and 4 having the IC50 ranging from 0.5-1.6 g/ml and dose dependent fragmentation of DNA with induction of apoptosis occurred 24 hours after administration [5]. Cytotoxic effects of betulinic acid were also found in other cell lines including ovarian A2780, OVCAR-5, GROV-1, large cell lung cancer NCI- H460, epidermoid carcinoma A431, melanoma Me665/2/21, Me665/ 2/60, small cell lung cancer POGB and POGB/DX (doxorubicin resistant) with the IC50 values ranging from 1.5-4.5 g/ml. How- ever, it showed lower toxicity to non-tumor cell lines such as HDFC (normal dermal fibroblasts, IC50 = 10.2 ± 1.5 g/ml) and PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes, IC50 = 50 g/ml), in compari- son with doxorubicin (HDFC, IC50 = 0.38 g/ml; PBL, IC50 =0.02 g/ml). Interestingly, betulinic acid was markedly more effective than cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and radiation on the primary cancer cells isolated from glioblastoma multiforme [6]. It was demonstrated also that one of the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid and its derivatives was apoptosis induction which was mediated by increasing permeability of the mitochondrial membrane which disturbs the transmembrane potential, causing the release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), with the resulting activation of caspases 3 and 8. Subsequent cleavage of the substrates and nuclear fragmentation thus occurred [7]. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 or BcL-xL proteins suppresses activation of caspases and other markers of apoptosis of neuroectodermal origin [8]. Furthermore, betulinic acid was found to exert its cytotoxic effect against human glioma cell lines 770 Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 Cazal et al. (LN-229, U87, MG, T98G, LN-18 and LN-308) and an increased level of the proapoptotic protein Bax was observed 24 hours after treatment with betulinic acid. The induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for activation of caspase 3, also occurred [9]. On the other hand, clones of these cell lines express- ing high levels of Bcl-2, showed reduced ROS without activation of betulinic acid induced apoptosis. These findings were in accordance with the fact that the antiapoptotic properties of Bcl-2 are connected with antioxidative defence mechanisms. This underlines the importance of producing ROS in the induction of apoptosis by betulinic acid. Betulinic acid is also an inhibitor of the enzyme aminopeptidase N which takes part in the angioproliferative and metastatic activity of tumors. From a clinical perspective, it is interesting to point out that betulinic acid exhibits its greater effect in an environment with a pH lower than 6.8, which is the case for the majority of tumors [10]. Tellingly, in contrast to non- cancer cells, cancer cells subjected to hypothermia showed increased sensitivity to betulinic acid [11]. For the ursane group, boswellic acid and its derivatives were found to be cytotoxic to glioma cell lines [12]. In animal model, depending on dose, they caused an increased passage of cells to apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival after implantation of cell lines of malignant glioma C6 [13]. Deriva- tives of boswellic acid were found to induce differentiation in leu- kemic cell lines in low concentrations and in high concentrations they led to apoptosis [14]. The antiproliferative effects of these derivatives are connected to their ability to inhibit both topoi- somerase I and II, whose activity is critical for the proliferation of cancer cells. Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (AKBA), originally isolated from Boswellia serrata, was found to inhibit constitutive STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription-3) in human multiple myeloma cells [15]. Activation of STAT3 has been linked with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and angiogene- sis of tumor cells, including human multiple myeloma. Thus, agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential as cancer thera- peutics. Lipophilicity of boswellic acid derivatives allows them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and thus renders them the potential for use in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS. Concerning this, they were found to show higher inhibitory effects against glioma cells than those of the clinically used anticancer agents camptothecins [16] and etoposide [12]. Furthermore, derivatives of boswellic acid are shown to be suitable for palliative treatment of progressive or relapsing brain tumors, due to, among other things, their anti-edematous properties [17]. Another interesting member of the ursane group is ursolic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid in higher plants. This compound was found to show inhibitory activity against mammalian DNA polymerases and , and human DNA topoisomerases I and II. It also inhibits bovine DNA polymerase , rat polymerase , HIV reverse transcriptase. It was also found to lower transcription of COX-2 by inhibition of the signal pathways PKC and AP-1. As the expression of PKC and AP-1 is elevated in a number of tumors, thus targeting these molecules is one of the aims of antiproliferative therapy [18]. One of the most important members of the oleanane group is oleanolic acid which is present in high concentration in the ginseng root and it showed a range of antitumour effects. Oleanolic acid was shown to induce differentiation in the teratocarcinoma cell line F9 [19]. Furthermore, it was found to exhibit also antimutagenic and antiangiogenic activities [20, 21]. In addition, it also stimulates the release of NO and TNF-, including induction of iNOS activity and TNF- expression in macrophages. This effect is mediated by its ability to activate DNA binding to the transcription complex NF- B and thereby its activation. Maslinic acid, another oleanane triterpenoid which is present in high concentrations in the protective wax-like coating of olives, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of HT29 colon cancer cells [22]. Treatment with maslinic acid resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death in colon- cancer cells. Mechanism study has revealed that maslinic acid in- hibited considerably the expression of Bcl-2 whilst increasing that of Bax. It also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-c and activated caspases 9 and 3. Finally, for the dammarane group, fomitellic acids A and B, the secondary metabolites of basidiomy- cete Fomitella fraxinea, were shown to inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase and , and human DNA topoisomerase I and II. It exhibited also cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines NUGC-3, and PC-12 where differentiation was observed with subcytotoxic concentrations [23]. In the course of our research program on isolation, synthesis and evaluation of anticancer activity of plant natural products, we have evaluated the capacity of two dammarane type triterpenes (1 and 2), four tirucallane type triterpenes (3-6, Fig. 1) and eight Fig. (1). Structure of dammarane (1, 2) and tirucallane (3, 4, 5, 6) triterpenes evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.

Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the four most active compounds was also investigated for their effects on the cell cycle profile and the programmed cell death of the NCI-H460 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, at ambient temperature on a Bruker ARX 400 instrument operating at 400 and 80 MHz, respectively. The Shimadzu LC-6AD model HPLC equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-6AV UV detector (240 and 215 nm) and a Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2Ga column (400 x 25 mm, 5m particle size) was used. For column chromatography, Silica gel 60 (Acros organics) and Sephadex LH 20 (Amersham Pharma- cia Biotech AB) were used. Solvents were from Synt and reagents were from SIGMA, unless otherwise stated. Extraction and Isolation of the Compounds Isolation of Cabraleadiol (1) and Ocotillone (2) Fruits of Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. was collected in Federal University of Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The plant material was identified by T.D. Pennington of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (UK). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of De- partamento de Engenharia Florestral, Dendrologia of the Federal University of Viçosa. After removing seeds, dried fruits (460g) were ground and ex- tracted with ethanol (3 x 500 mL), at room temperature and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 88 g of a concentrated ethanolic extract which was dissolved in 400 ml of a 3:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O. The aqueous methanolic solution was partitioned successively with hexane (2x300 ml), CH2Cl2 (2x300 ml) and EtOAc (2x300 ml) to furnish hexane (47.4 g), dichloro- methane (5.4 g) and ethyl acetate (4.4 g) fractions. The hexane fraction was applied over a silica gel column (250 g) and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, eight 700 ml fractions were collected as follows: fr 1 (hexane), fr 2 (hexane- CH2Cl2, 1:1), fr 3 ((hexane-CH2Cl2, 3:7), Fr 4 (hexane), fr 5 (CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 1:1), fr 6 (EtOAc), fr 7 (EtOAc-MeOH, 1:1), fr 8 (MeOH). Fr. 2 (120 mg) was placed on a gel permeation column of Sephadex LH- 20 (50 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of MeOH-CH2Cl2 to afford three 250 ml subfractions. Subfr 2 (88.6 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (15 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of hex- ane-Me2CO to give five 100 ml fractions. Frs 3 and 4, after evapo- ration of the solvent by reduced pressure, afforded, respectively, 24.4 mg of cabraleadiol (1) and 16.3 mg of ocotillone (2) whose structures were established by 1H and 13C NMR as well as compari- son of their spectral and physical data with those reported in the literature [24, 25]. Isolation of 7-Deacetoxy-7-Oxogedunin (7) and 6-Acetoxygedunin (10) Fruits of Carpa guianensis Aubl. were purchased from the city of Belém (Pará State, Brazil). Dried and ground fruit aril (160g) was extracted with MeOH (3 x 500 ml) at room temp. The metha- nolic solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 40 g of the crude methanol extract which was dissolved in 150 ml of a 4:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O and then partitioned with hexane (3x 150 ml) and EtOAc (3x 150 ml) to give, respectively 23 g and 15 g of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. The ethyl acetate extract was Fig. (2). Structure of limonoids (7-14) evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.

Purification of fr 8 by isocratic HPLC, using a mixture of MeOH/ CH2Cl2 (7:3) as solvent and a UV detec- tion at 254 nm, yielded 32.1 mg of 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (7) and 55.8 mg of 6-acetoxygedunin (10) whose structures were estab- lished by comparison of their 1H and 13CNMR data with those re- ported in the literature [26]. Preparation of Acetonide of Odoradol (5) Odoratol (4, 25 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of acetone and one drop of conc.H2SO4 was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, under N2 atmosphere, for 3 h after which the solution was evaporated and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was washed with H2O to remove H2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent gave 15 mg of acetonide of odoratol (5). Isolations of the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3), odoratol (4), 22-hydroxytirucalla-7, 24-diene-2,3-dione (6) and the limon- oids gedunin (8) and 7-deacetoxygedunin (9) from Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona cilata var. australis have been described previ- ously by de Paula et al. [27, 28]. Isolation and characterization of the limonoids 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12), toonacilin (13) from Toona ciliata were described by Neto et al. [29, 30] while isolation of guyanin (14) from Hortia oreadica, was reported by Severino et al. [31]. Biological Activity Reagents RPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, phos- phate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were from Gibco Invitrogen Co. (Scotland, UK). Acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), penicillin, streptomycin, sulforhodamine B (SRB) and trypan blue were from Sigma Chemi- cal Co (Saint Louis, USA). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Tris were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Solutions of Compounds Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and kept at -20 ºC. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were freshly prepared just prior to each assay. Cell Lines Three human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 (breast adenocarci- noma, ECACC), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, a kind gift from NCI, Bethesda, USA) and A375-C5 (melanoma, ECACC) were grown as a monolayer and routinely maintained in RPMI- 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml strepto- mycin), at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Tumour Cell Growth Assay The effect of the compounds on the growth of the described human tumour cell lines was evaluated according to the procedure adopted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) in the “In vitro Anticancer Drug Discovery Screen”, which uses the protein- binding dye SRB to assess cell growth [32, 33]. The plating density of each cell line was 1.5 x 105 cells/ml for MCF-7, and 7.5 x 104 cells/ml for NCI-H460 and A375-C5. Cells were allowed to attach overnight in 96-well plates and were then exposed for 48 h to five serial concentrations of the compounds, starting from a maximum concentration of 150 μM (final concentration). At the end of this incubation period the adherent cells were fixed in situ with 10% TCA (final concentration), washed with distilled water and stained with 0.4% SRB (solubilised in 1% acetic acid). The bound stain was solubilised in 10 mM Tris and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (EAR400 STL-Labinstruments). For each test compound and for each cell line a dose-response curve was made and the value of GI50, corresponding to the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the net cell growth, was calcu- lated as described elsewhere [33]. Doxorubicin, used as a positive control, was tested in the same manner. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile and Levels of Apoptosis in the NCI-H460 Cell Line The compounds with GI50 bellow (or similar to) 10 M were selected for further analysis of their effect on cell cycle profile and apoptosis. These assays were carried out in the NCI-H460 cells, since they were one of the most sensitive cells to these compounds. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7.5104 cells/ml) and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h, in order to adhere. Cells were then incubated for 48 h with complete medium (control), the compounds solvent (DMSO) or with the compounds at their respective GI50 concentra- tions (determined by the SRB assay). Cells were then harvested and further processed for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cellular DNA content (for cell cycle analysis and presence of sub-G1 peak) was then analyzed as previ- ously described [34], using an Epics XL-MCL Coulter flow cy- tometer, plotting at least 20,000 events per sample. Apoptosis was analyzed using the Human Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis Kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Measurement of phosphatidylserine externalization was processed using a flow cytometer plotting at least 20,000 events per sample (as above). Both cell cycle distribution and apoptosis data were analyzed using the FlowJo 7.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). At least three inde- pendent experiments were carried out and results are presented as the average and standard error (SEM) of those experiments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Six triterpenes (Fig. 1) and eight limonoids (Fig. 2) were evalu- ated for their ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of three human tumour cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non- small lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5), using the protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) method and their growth inhibitory effect, expressed as GI50 (M), is shown in Table 1. Following a continuous exposure for 48 h, all six triterpenes (1- 6) and only four limonoids (8, 11, 12, 13) were found to be active against all three tumour cell lines whereas the other four limonoids (7, 9, 10 and 14) were inactive (Table 1). The tirucallane triterpene odoradol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15 - epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) showed strong cell growth inhibitory activity, presenting their GI50 values below 12 M for all three cell lines. Interestingly, the limonoid cedrelone (12) was found to be not only the most active growth inhibitor but also more selective on NCI-H460 (GI50 = 2.77 ± 0.07M) and A375-C5 (GI50 = 2.60 ± 0.21M) cell lines when compared to odoradol (4), gedunin (8) and 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11). While the dammarane cabraleadiol (1) showed moderate activity in all three cell lines (GI50>30 M), the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3) and 22-hydroxytirucalla-7,24-dien-2,3-dione (6) showed moder- ate growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but strong activity against A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, the dammarane triterpene ocotillone (2) showed only weak inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but moderate activity against A375-C5 cells whereas the limonoid toonacillin (13) showed weak inhibitory activity against all three cell lines. Though cabraleadiol (1) and ocotillone (2) are both 20, 24 – epoxydamma- rane, they differ only in the stereochemistry of C-24 and the func- tional group on C-3. With the C-24S configuration and the hydroxyl Evaluation of Triterpenes and Limonoids on Human Tumour Cell Lines Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 773 group on C-3, cabraleadiol (1) exhibited ca. three times higher in growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells than that of ocotillone (2) which has a ketone function on C-3 and the opposite configuration of C-24. However, the growth inhibitory effects on the A375-C5 cells are similar for both compounds. In fact, cabraleadiol (1), isolated from various plant sources, has been previously tested for its cytotoxicity against various tumour cell lines. Phongmaykin et al. [35] reported a weak cytotoxic effect of this compound, isolated from Chisocheton penduliflorus (Meli- aceae), on a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Qiu et al. [24] have found no cytotoxic effect of cabraleadiol (1), isolated from Aglaia lawii, on the LNcaP, Col 2 and KB cancer cell lines. On the other hand, ocotillone (2), isolated from Betula platyphylla var. japonica, was evaluated against a variety of human cancer cell lines, and was found to show no cytotoxicity against the KB (human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx), K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and COLO205 (colon carcinoma) cell lines. Interest- ingly, though ocotillone (2) did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against KB-C2 (cochicine-resistant KB) cells (IC50 values >100 M), it was found to show moderate cytotoxic activity (with IC50 ranging from 20.6 to 64.2 M) in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine. The en- hanced cytotoxicity of ocotillone (2) against KB-C2 cells in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine as compared with that in the absence of colchicine, suggesting that this triterpene might show some MDR-reversing effects [25]. For the tirucallane triterpenes, odoratol (4) was the most active analogue exhibiting GI50 values in the rank of 10 M. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 of odoratol (4) by a ketone group in odoratone (3) caused a two fold decrease of the growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cell lines; however this structural alteration did not affect the growth inhibi- tory activity against the A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, trans- forming the vic diol functionality on the furan ring of odoratol (4) into its acetonide (5) led to a loss of activity. Concerning the limonoids, the most active analogue was cedre- lone (12), exhibiting GI50 values below 5 M in all three cell lines. Although the capacity of cedrelone (12) to inhibit the in vitro growth of human tumour cells have not been previously reported, this compound is known to demonstrate several other activities including insecticide [36], antifeedant [37] and antifungal activity [38]. Although its growth inhibitory effect was ca. two folds less than that of cedrelone, the structurally related limonoid 6-acetoxy- 14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) also exhibited strong growth inhibi- tory activity against all three cancer cell lines. Interestingly, Maneerat et al. [39] have found that 6-acetoxyepoxyazadione, isolated from Chisocheton siamensis and which differs from 11 only in the presence of the carbonyl group on C-16 of the former, was inactive against oral human epidermal carcinoma (KB), small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Among the limonoids whose structure possessing the lactone moiety on the ring D, gedunin (8) was the only member which exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three human tumour cell lines (GI50 10 M); however 7-deacetylgedunin (9) was inactive. Inter- estingly, Brandt et al. [40] have evaluated, among several ana- logues, gedunin (8) and 7-deacetylgedunin (9), obtained from neem oils, for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cell lines. While gedunin (8) was found to exhibit strong antiproliferative activity against both cell lines (IC50 = 8.84±0.03 for MCF-7 and 3.22± 0.6 for SKBr3), 7-deacetylgedunin (9) showed only moderate activity (IC50 = 28.96±4.48 for MCF-7 and 21.09± 5.95 for SKBr3). Gedunin (8) was also shown to mani- fest anticancer activity via inhibition of the 90 kDa heat shock pro- tein (Hsp90) folding machinery [41] and to induce the degradation of Hsp90-dependent client proteins similar to other Hsp90 inhibi- tors [42]. In order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the most active compounds, they were assayed for their effect on the cell cycle profile of the NCI-H460 cells. Thus, NCI-H460 cells were treated with odoratol (4), gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) at their respective GI50 concentrations (values of GI50 for NCI-H460 from Table 1) for 48 h and processed for cell cycle analysis. Results (Fig. 3) show that the majority of the compounds tested (with the exception of 11) affected the normal cell cycle distribution of the NCI-H460 cells. Odoratol (4) was found to induce a cell cycle ar- Table 1.

Doxorubicin was used as positive control of the assay and the following GI50 values were obtained: MCF-7 = 42.8 ± 8.2 nM; NCI-H460 = 94.0 ± 8.7 nM; A375-C5 = 79.5 ± 8.4 nM. 774 Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 Cazal et al. rest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% cells in this phase upon DMSO treatment to 70% of cells following treatment with this compound), causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 13%) and G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 11%) phases of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with gedunin (8), the cell cycle progression was blocked (arrested) in the S phase (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 60%), leading to a de- crease in the % of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). Incubation with cedrelone (12) caused an accumulation of cells (arrest) in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 40%) and the G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 43%) phases of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the % of cells in G1 (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). In addition, there were indications that odoratol (4), gedunin (8) and cedrelone (12) induced apoptosis because of the increase in the sub-G1 popu- lation of cells when compared to control. Therefore, a specific apoptosis assay was carried out. Indeed, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was performed to deter- mine the % of cells in early and late apoptosis (and necrosis) by flow cytometry, following treatment of NCI-H460 cells with the selected compounds. Results showed that for all tested compounds, but very modestly for odoratol (4) and 6-acetoxy-14,15- epoxyazadirone (11), the % of cells in early (annexin V positive, PI negative) or late apoptosis (annexin V-positive, PI positive) were increased upon treatment of cells with the GI50 concentration of the compounds (Table 2). Gedunin (8) caused an increase in cell death from approximately 12.6% in controls (or 11.2% in DMSO control) to 47.2% in cells treated for 48 h with the GI50 concentration of this compound. Indeed, cedrelone (12) was particularly effective in inducing programmed cell death, causing 80.3% of cell death upon 48 h treatment of the cells with its GI50 concentration. It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the observed apoptotic inducing effects, particularly the effects on caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be investigated, by analyzing the levels of Bax and other apoptosis related proteins, such as Bcl-2 or BcL-xL. This would be possible by analyzing ex- tracts of cells treated with the compounds (with or without caspase inhibitors) for the levels of apoptosis associated proteins, by West- ern Blot with appropriate antibodies, as has been carried out by others for example in order to study the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by lupeol [43]. CONCLUSION Six triterpenes (two dammaranes and four tirucallanes) and eight limonoids, isolated from the members of the families Meli- aceae and Rutaceae, were evaluated by the SRB method for their cytotoxic effect against three human tumour cell lines. The tirucal- lane triterpene odoratol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12) were the most active inhibitors of cell growth (GI50 less than 12 μM). Of these, cedrelone (12) has shown to be the most active growth in- hibitor, presenting GI50 values below 4.20 μM in all three tested cell lines. From the analysis of the cell cycle profile in NCI-H460 cells, it was possible to conclude that odoratol (4) arrests cell cycle at the G1 phase, gedunin (8) causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase and cedrelone (12) at the S and G2M phases while 6-acetoxy-14,15- epoxyazadirone (11) did not affect the cell cycle profile of these cells. In addition, analysis of programmed cell death indicates that odoratol (4) and 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) cause a very small increase in cell death but gedunin (8) and particularly cedrelone (12), are very potent inducers of programmed cell death. In conclusion, cedrelone (12) is very potent by causing cell cycle Fig. (3).

It is evident from the number of recent studies that triterpenoid compounds represent a promising and expanding platform for natu- ral anticancer agents whose potential is currently still not fully ex- ploited by pharmaceutical industry. As a number of recently studied triterpenoids compare very favourably with drugs in current use [44], it is foreseeable that attention of many research institutions and pharmaceutical companies will be drawn to this class of com- pounds.

Received: 15 November 2010; in revised form: 2 December 2010 / Accepted: 6 December 2010 / Published: 13 December 2010 Abstract: Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae), popularly known as guarantã, goiabeira, is a native tree from Brazil. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the ethanol stems extract afforded the isolation of six alkaloids: leiokinine A, leptomerine, kokusaginine, skimmianine, maculine and flindersiamine. All isolated compounds were tested for acetyl cholinesterase inhibition, in vitro and displayed anticholinesterasic activity. The alkaloid leptomerine showed the highest activity (IC50 = 2.5 μM), similar to that of the reference compound galanthamine (IC50 = 1.7 μM). The results showed for the first time the presence of alkaloids leptomerine and skimmianine in E. leiocarpa (Engl.) with potent anticholinesterasic activity. Keywords: Esenbeckia leiocarpa; Rutaceae; alkaloids; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors OPEN ACCESS Molecules 2010, 15 9206 1. Introduction The genus Esenbeckia comprises 30 species distributed in Tropical America [1]. Chemical studies of Esenbeckia spp. showed that they synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites, particularly quinolinic, quinolonic and indolic alkaloids and furocoumarins, and these compounds were considered chemical markers of this genus [2-4]. Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae), native from Brazil, is an ornamental tree widely distributed in Brazilian Dense Ombrophilous Atlantic Forest from South of Bahia to São Paulo states and is commonly known as guarantã (SP), goiabeira (BA), antã-forte and guarataia (ES) [5]. Previous studies on E. leiocarpa have been reported in the literature, and various compounds have been isolated from it, such as the alkaloids kokusaginine, flindersiamine, maculine, dictamnine, 4- methoxy-2-(3´-pentyl)quinoline, 1,4-dihydro-1-methyl-2-(3´-pentyl)quinolin-4-one, leiokinine A and leiokinine B, twelve indole derivatives, three lignans, one coumarin, two amides and the methyl 4- isoprenyloxy-trans-cinnamate [3,6,7]. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive cognitive dysfunction that results from a deficiency in cholinergic activity in brain [8]. Several plant-derived drugs (rivastigmine and galanthamine) that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can be used to treat early stages of AD, since these compounds increase the endogenous levels of acetylcholine to boost cholinergic neurotransmission. In a recent review, 260 chemically defined natural molecules were evaluated for acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The compounds tested were classified in alkaloids (139), monoterpenes (27), coumarins (18), triterpenes (17), flavonoids (14), benzenoids (13), diterpenes (8), oxygen heterocycles (5), sesquiterpenes (5), stilbenes (3), lignans (2), sulfur compounds (2), proteids (2), polycyclic (1), quinoid (1), benzoxazinone (1), carotenoid (1) and alycyclic (1) [9-11]. Strong efforts to discover new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from a vast number of plant species were realized in our laboratory. In a screening of 58 extracts from native Brazilian plants, the ethanolic crude extract of the stems of Esenbeckia leiocarpa showed a strong acetylcholinesterase inhibition and was chosen for bioassay-guided fractionation in order to isolate the biologically active compounds and evaluate the acetylcholinesterase inhibition of these compounds. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Effect of crude extract and hexane and alkaloid fractions on acetylcholinesterase inhibition The crude ethanol extract of Esenbeckia leiocarpa stems inhibited 91.1 ± 0.2% of acetylcholinesterase activity when tested at 200 μg/mL. Acid-base partition was used to separate the crude extract (35.8 g) of Esenbeckia leiocarpa into two fractions, hexane and chloroform (Alkaloid) and the yield of each fraction was 0.64% and 3.30%, respectively. The ethanol extract, hexane and alkaloid fractions of Esenbeckia leiocarpa inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity with an IC50 50.7 μg/mL, 6.0 μg/mL and 1.6 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 1). The chloroform fraction, with positive result for alkaloids (Dragendorff´s and iodoplatinate reagents), exhibited highest level of AChE inhibition and was selected for further purification.

Chromatographic profile of alkaloid fraction The analytical chromatographic (HPLC) analyses of alkaloid fraction (105.0 mg) from E. leiocarpa afforded 14 fractions from which six major compounds were identified. They were fractionated by chromatographic procedure and the anticholinesterasic activity of each fraction was tested by TLC bioassay as described by Marston et al. [12]. The fractions 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 presented strong anticholinesterasic activity on TLC bioassay (results not showed) and retention times (tR) of 9.12 min, 11.69 min, 14.26 min, 15.60 min and 20.73 min, respectively (Figure 2).

Isolation and identification of alkaloids from stems of E. leiocarpa The alkaloid fraction of E. leiocarpa (m = 105.0 mg) was dissolved into MeOH (10 mg/mL) and submitted to RP-HPLC using acetonitrile-water-methanol (10:45:45) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 242 nm and flow rate of 8 mL/min, affording 14 fractions (Fractions 1–14). From preparative HPLC, fractions Fr. 7 (tR = 15.4 min) and Fr. 9 (tR = 19.3 min) were identified as two 4- quinolinone alkaloids, leiokinine A (1, 5.8 mg) [3] and leptomerine (2, 16.0 mg) [13], respectively. Fractions Fr. 10 (tR = 24.5 min) and Fr. 11 (tR = 26.2 min) yielded two furoquinoline alkaloids, kokusaginine (3, 5.7 mg) [14] and skimmianine (4, 12.3 mg) [15], respectively. In addition, fraction Fr. 12 (tR = 34.3 min) afforded a mixture of two others furoquinoline alkaloids (3.2 mg), maculine (5) [16] and flindersiamine (6) [6] (Figure 3). Their identification was based on analysis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments, as well as by comparison with literature data, 13C-NMR data of compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 and 1H-NMR data of compounds 5 and 6 (see Experimental section).

Anticholinesterasic activity of alkaloids The alkaloids maculine, flindersiamine, kokusaginine, leptomerine, leiokinine A and skimmianine identified in this work were previously isolated from other Esenbeckia species [1,17-19]. The alkaloids leptomerine and skimmianine have already been isolated from Haplophyllum heptomerum (Rutaceae) in 1986 [13]. However, this is the first occurrence of leptomerine and skimmianine in Esenbeckia leiocarpa (Engl.). To date, no study on evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity was performed with species of the genus Esenbeckia. In the present paper, the alkaloids isolated from stems of E. leiocarpa, leiokinine A and skimmianine presented acetylcholinesterase inhibition with IC50 values of 0.21 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. While leptomerine and kokusaginine showed IC50 values of 2.5 μM and 46 μM, respectively (Figure 4).

On the other hand, the alkaloids isolated from leaves of E. belizencis Lundell were tested in the brine shrimp toxicity assay and revealed that kokusaginine have mildly toxicity (LC50 = 367 ppm) and flindersiamine did not showed toxicity (LC50 > 1,000 ppm) [20]. The alkaloids maculine, kokusaginine, skimmianine and flindersiamine demonstrated weak mutagenic activity [21,22]. In another species of Rutaceae, Raulinoa echinata Cowan, these same alkaloids showed antifungal activity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, a symbiotic fungus of leaf-cutting ants [23]. 3. Experimental 3.1. Plant material The stems of Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. were collected in January 2007 from a specimen cultivated at the “Cidade Universitária - Armando Salles de Oliveira- CUASO”, USP, São Paulo State, Brazil, and identified by Dr. José Rubens Pirani. A voucher specimen (SPF 1169) was deposited at the Herbarium of the Departamento de Botânica, Instituto de Biociências, USP, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. 3.2. Extraction and isolation The dry stems of Esenbeckia leiocarpa (1000 g) were powdered and extracted with ethanol (5 × 1.5 L) using a maceration method. The ethanol extract (35.8 g) was re-dissolved in aqueous solution (HCl 0.1 M, 2 × 120 mL) and the insoluble portion was filtered off. The acid solution was partitioned with hexane (7 × 60 mL) yielding a hexane fraction (0.230 g). The acid aqueous fraction was basified with NH4OH (pH 10) and partitioned with CHCl3 (7 × 60 mL) yielding an active alkaloid Molecules 2010, 15 9210 fraction (1.182 g). All the fractions were tested in biological test for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity. 3.3. General methods for compounds identification The alkaloid fraction was analyzed in HPLC Varian Pro Star 310 system equipped with a 20 μL injection loop. The column used was a Phenomenex C-18 (250 × 4.6 mm) maintained at 20 °C. Twenty μL of the sample (1 mg/mL) was injected, the mobile phase (1 mL/min) was ACN: MeOH: H2O (10:45:45). Preparative HPLC was carried out using Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm × 20.0 mm) preparative column. HPLC analysis of alkaloid fraction afforded 14 fractions. Fractions 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were identified by NMR analyses. The 1D – (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using the CDCl3 as an internal standard.

Molecules 2010, 15 9211 3.4. Anticholinesterasic assay Acetylcholinesterase activity was measured using a 96-well microplate reader [24] based on Ellman´s method [25]. In the 96-well plates, 25 μL of 15 mM acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) in water, 125 μL of 3 mM DTNB in buffer C, 50 μL of buffer B, 25 μL of plant extract, alkaloid or hexane fractions (0.2 to 100.0 μg mL-1) were added and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s for three times. Then 25 μL of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme were added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min for two times. The percentage of inhibition was calculated by comparison with the rates for the sample to a blank (10% MeOH in Buffer A). The following buffers were used. Buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; buffer B: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction (BSA); buffer C: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2·6H2O. 3.5. Statistical analysis of data Data were presented as means ± SEM of experiments realized at least in triplicate. The IC50 values were calculated by means of regression analysis. 4. Conclusions The alkaloids kokusaginine, flindersiamine, maculine and leiokinine A were previously isolated from E. leiocarpa. On the other hand, this is the first occurrence of leptomerine and skimmianine in Esenbeckia leiocarpa. There are many compounds identified from higher plants with acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity as huperzine A, galanthamine isolated from Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) Trev. [26] and Galanthus nivalis Lumikello, respectively, and used for dementia treatment. Some biological activities have been reported for the alkaloids isolated in this work, but none have been found to be related to acetycholinesterase inhibition. This work demonstrated that these alkaloids presented potent anticholinesterasic activity and must be tested in pharmacological models in vivo to determine if they have activity on memory of mice and pre clinical studies before human application.

Received: 24 May 2014; in revised form: 1 July 2014 / Accepted: 16 July 2014 / Published: 12 August 2014 Abstract: Previous investigations of H. oreadica reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of H. oreadica, H. brasiliana and H. superba searching for other secondary metabolites present in substantial amounts for taxonomic analysis. In a continuation of the investigation of the H. oreadica, three new limonoids have now been isolated 9α-hydroxyhortiolide A, 11β-hydroxyhortiolide C and 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7- deoxoinchangin. All the isolated compounds from the Hortia species reinforce its position in the Rutaceae. With regard to limonoids the genus produces highly specialized compounds, whose structural variations do not occur in any other member of the Rutaceae, thus, it is evident from limonoid data that Hortia takes an isolated position within the family. In addition, H. superba afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen, which may not be a genuine natural product. Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle- spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, X-Ray fluorescence and Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy experiments show that the Sephadex LH-20 was modified after treatment with NaOCl, suggesting that when xanthotoxin (8-methoxy-psoralen) was extracted from cleaning of the gel column, chlorination of the aromatic system occurred.

Introduction Previous investigations of H. oreadica reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids [1–3]. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of H. oreadica, H. brasiliana and H. superba. Three new limonoids have now been isolated (1–3), 1 and 3 from taproots and 2 from stem of H. oreadica. In addition, H. superba afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (4) from branches (Figure 1). Figure 1.

Hypohalite (HOX) is the halogenating species produced by haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. This may be considered as a source of electron-deficient halogen (X+) that can react with an electron-rich centre in the substrate, as the coumarins. In contrast, the most common types of halogenated coumarins are those with a prenyl epoxide ring, which was cleaved under acid conditions (H+/Cl−). There is some suspicion that these compounds are artefacts of the isolation procedures. These compounds are a comparatively rare group isolated from Rutaceae plants such as in Toddalia asiatica [5,7-dimethoxy-6- (3-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)coumarin], Murraya paniculata [7-methoxy-8-(1-hydroxy-2-chloro- 3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin, 7-methoxy-8-(1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin], and in Triphasia trifolia [7-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)-8-(3-methyl-2-oxobutyl)coumarin, 5-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)psoralen] [4–6]. Aromatic systems react with chlorine in an electrophilic substitution reaction, in which chlorine acts as the electrophile (Cl+), whose presence is rare in the isolation procedures. 3-Chloro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-chromen-2-one appears to be unique as natural metabolite in the coumarin class, which was isolated from leaves of Ficus krishnae, Moraceae [7]. Most of the phytochemical studies on Rutaceae genera have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed coumarin containing chlorine in the 1-benzopyran-2-one skeleton if they had been present. In developing countries, as in Brazil, where universities and research funding agencies cannot afford Sephadex (LH-20) in sufficient quantities for scientific studies, using cleaning gel with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a common practice. However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of Sephadex LH-20 and hypochlorite in the formation of compound 4, until the cleaning gel is analyzed by solid NMR, X-Ray fluorescence (XRF), Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), Infrared (IR), and Fourier transform Raman (FTR) to confirm whether this can serve as an efficient chloroniun ion supplier. Molecules 2014, 19 12033 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structure Elucidation of New Compounds The spectra of compounds 1–4 can be seen in Figures S1–S30 in the online Supplementary. Compound 1 showed spectral characteristics close to those of hortiolide A (5) (C27H32O7; Figure 1), which has previously been isolated from H. colombiana (H. colombiana = H. brasiliana) [8]. HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H32O8 for compound 1, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with 5. The main change observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 1 was the presence of a signal of a hydrogen of a hydroxyl group at δ 2.94 (s). This hydrogen at δ 2.94 showed HMBC correlation with the 13C-NMR signals of C-8 (δ 90.2). The methyl proton signal at δ 1.52, assigned to Me-19, showed cross peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-1 (δ 178.8), C-5 (δ 42.3), C-10 (δ 50.6), and at δ 80.5 (quaternary), allowing the assignment of the last signal to C-9, since it was the only carbon left in the skeleton for a 3J. These correlations indicated the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-9. The relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was determined from gNOESY experiments. The nOes of the H3-19 (δ 1.52), H3-18 (δ 1.21) and H3-30 (δ 1.71), coming from 9-OH (δ 2.94), required the 9-OH to be syn (α) to Me-18, Me-19 and Me-30. The structure of the new natural product 1 was thus established as 9α-hydroxyhortiolide A. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of hortiolide A (5) [9]. Table 1. 1H-NMR spectroscopic data for 1–4.

Compound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) to hortiolide C (6) isolated previously from dichloromethane extract of taproots of H. oreadica [2]. In HMBC experiments the unsubstituted Molecules 2014, 19 12035 C-12 emerged from the correlation between the H3-18 signal at δ 1.15 and the 13C signal at δ 42.7, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 1.68 (m), ascribed to H2-12. The signal for H-12 was coupled to the 1H signal at δ 4.43 (d, J = 4.8 Hz) assigned to H-11, indicating a hydroxyl group at C-11. HREIMS showed the molecular formula C27H32O9 and confirmed the structure 2 for this compound. In the g-NOESY experiments, the nOes of the H3-19 (δ 1.54) and H3-30 (δ 1.80), coming from H-11 (δ 4.43), required the 11-OH to be anti (β) to Me-18 and Me-30. Thus, the structure of compound 2 was proposed as 11β-hydroxyhortiolide C. The NMR spectra and extensive analysis of 2D-NMR spectra (Table 2) suggested the ichangin-type (7) [12] framework for compound 3. Some of the changes observed in the NMR spectra were signals for the presence of a secondary acetoxyl group (13C signals δ 169.6, 21.4, 1H signal -OCOMe δ 2.15). A significant downfield shift for C-1 (δ 80.0), when compared with ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7), determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. The 13C signal at δ 80.0 showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 4.04 (brd, J = 4.2 Hz), which showed cross-peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-3 (δ 169.4), C-19 (δ 65.6), and C-9 (δ 43.3). The 1H signal at δ 4.04 and a methyl signal at δ 2.15 showed long-range correlation with the 13C-NMR signals at δ 169.6, confirming an acetoxyl group at C-1. A second change observed in the 13C-NMR spectra was the replacement of the resonance for a carbonyl by signal for an oxymethine carbon at δ 73.2, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 4.56 (t, J = 2.6 Hz). A hydroxyl group must thus be connected to C-7 due to the observed correlations of the 1H signal at δ 4.56 with the 13C-NMR for C-5 at δ 53.6, C-8 at δ 43.0 and C-30 at δ 18.4. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7). The NOE of the H-1 (δ 4.04) coming from H-5 (δ 2.25) and H-9 (δ 2.72) were weak but definite, suggesting a spatial proximity of H-1α to H-5α and H-9α, and confirming the acetoxyl group in the β-configuration as in ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7, S* configuration at C-1) [12]. In addition, the NOE of the H-7 (δ 4.56) coming from H3-30 (δ 0.95) required the hydroxyl group at C-7 to be anti (α) to H3-30 (β). The structure of the new natural product 3 was thus established as 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxoinchangin. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of ichangin (7) [12]. The coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (4) was not separated from xanthotoxin (8) and isopimpinellin (9). The 1H-NMR in addition to signals described in the literature for 8 and 9, revealed signals nearly the same as that of 9 (Table 1). In addition four methoxyl group signals were observed at δ 4.27, 4.16 (6H), and 4.29, which were placed at C-8 in 8, C-5 and C-8 in 9 and at C-8 in 4, respectively, by NOE experiments. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of coumarins if C-5 is unsubstituted the doublets arising from H-3 and H-4 are found at ca δ 6.2 and 7.6, respectively. The downfield shift of the H-4 to about δ 8.0 occurs in C-5 alkoxyl-substituted coumarins, as in 9 in comparison with 8 [13]. Hence, the doublets at δ 7.76, 8.11 and 8.15 were assigned to H-4 for 8, 9, and 4, respectively, and indicating that C-5 was substituted in 4. This mixture was analyzed by GC-MS (Figures S26–S29 in supplementary), which established that the coumarins were xanthotoxin (8), isopimpinellin (9), and indicated the compound 4 to contain chlorine, determining the position of this halogen at C-5, whose spectroscopic properties accord with the above data. This mixture was also analyzed by ESI-MS (Figure 30 in supplementary), which showed protonated molecule ([M + H+]) at m/z 251.5 and ([M+2 + H+]) 253.5 for compound 4. Simulation of isotope ratio mass spectrum for C12H7O4Cl provided the differences in Molecules 2014, 19 12036 naturally-occurring isotopic abundances, which showed peaks similar to those found for compound 4, the [M+2 + H+] (m/z 253) peak about one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak ([M + H+] m/z 251), confirming the presence of chlorine. Although, the structure of 4 has been described as being a synthetic product and the 1H-NMR data for both are in close agreement with the structure proposed 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen [10]. 2.2. Sephadex LH-20 Analysis The mixture of coumarins 4, 8 and 9 was purified by gel permeation column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20, which was repacked with cleaning gel with sodium hypochlorite (0.8% watery solution). Sephadex LH-20 is cross-linked dextran which has been hydroxypropylated to yield a chromatographic media with both hydrophilic and lipophilic character [14,15]. Solid-state cross-polarization/magic-angle-spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS 13C-NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural product formed by the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite. Pure Sephadex LH-20 and the gel, which was washed only with sterile distilled water and allowed to swell overnight, were used as control. The HETCOR experiment (Figure 2) permitted the assignments of the protonated carbons signals at δ 97–94, 72–70, 68–63, and 15–20 to all C-1, C-2-4, C-5-6 and the methyl of propyl group, respectively, comparable with those reported for dextran samples [16,17]. It is clear that water induces no change in chemical shifts as shown in Figure 3. However, it is noted that the treatment with water leads to the increase of the linewidth. Another important observation which should be noted regards the intensity of the signals related to the carbons from glycoside units. For non-treated Sephadex, the hydroxyl groups from glycoside units in different polymeric chains interact through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the structure becomes very rigid, favoring the dipolar coupling. In this case the cross polarization is more efficient and the signals become more intense, even when compared to side aliphatic branches [18]. The 13C-NMR spectrum for cleaning gel (Figure 3) showed that the signals for all C-1 (δ 97–94) were of markedly different intensity (lowest intensity), suggesting the oxidation of α-D-glucopyranoses by hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which would result in depolymerisation [19]. In Sephadex LH-20 C-2-4 are hydroxypropylated, thus δ-aldonolactone could have glycosidic linkages by hydroxypropyl groups. This spectrum also showed that sodium hypochlorite affected the shape of the 13C-NMR signals for all C-2-4 (δ 81-70), suggesting that the oxidation reaction of free -OH at carbons C-2 and C-3 may have occurred. The C-5, C-6 and methyl signals of control and cleaning gel appeared at similar chemical shifts. The CP/MAS 13C-NMR experiments showed that the course of the reaction with hypochlorite is somewhat more complex than the oxidation indicated for C-1, C-2 and C-3. Hypochlorite specifically oxidizes the α anomer, and the initial product formed is a δ-aldonolactone (Scheme 1). Although, the free -OH in the glycoside units and in the hydroxypropyl groups must have been involved in the reaction with hypochlorous acid formed in the equilibrium of sodium hypochlorite and H2O, resulting in dextran ether hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which can serve as an efficient chloronium ion supplier [20,21].

For pure Sephadex this ratio is 4.0, for Sephadex-H2O it is approximately 3.3 and for Sephadex-H2O-NaOCl it is 2.0. This variation seems to be quite intriguing, but it is possible that this is related to the exchange of hydrogen by chlorine atoms, which occurred in the polar hydroxyl groups from the glycoside units. Furthermore, the presence of chlorine atoms and water molecules induce the increasing distance between chains. Once these events takes place the cross-polarization 1H→13C becomes less efficient, and the signal becomes less intense as mentioned earlier [18]. In order to observe the possible formation of dextran ether hypochlorite in the structure of Sephadex, 35Cl solid state NMR experiments were run, however no signal was observed (as can be seen in Figure 31 in supplementary). There are few papers in the literature that investigate 35Cl-NMR in organic compounds, and they always involve small molecules [22–24]. Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy analyses of pure Sephadex LH-20, gel washed with water, and gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite showed homogeneous beads in the first two (Figures 4 and S32–S34 in supplementary). In contrast, beads originating from gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite were not homogeneous and some strange material aggregates were observed between and on the polymer beads (Figure 4). These differences suggest modification in the structure of the polymer, or the presence of reaction products with hypochlorite or of salt sodium hypochlorite and HOCl. Comparing the standard gel with those treated with NaOCl shows that there is a decrease in the diameter of some particles, suggesting a dilution or formation of other products (Figure 4D,E). X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry was used and the results showed the presence of chlorine in pure Sephadex LH-20, in gel washed with sterile distilled water and cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (Figure 5). The chlorine content was 1.8 fold greater in the gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (0.159%) than that in pure Sephadex LH-20 (0.089%), and 2.9 than that in gel washed with water (0.055%).

These data suggest that if there were oxidation reactions and the formation of hypochlorite, their yields were low. In their FTR spectra there is a band at 847 cm−1 corresponding to the vibration of the α-anomer, characteristic of Sephadex [25]. Given that the yield of the reaction with hypochlorite was low, a second hypothesis is that the hypochlorite salt and HOCl retained on Sephadex beads react directly with the active aromatic system for aromatic substitution reactions with HOCl. Concluding two synthetic pathways to chlorination is possible, in the presence of dextran ether hypochlorite or HOCl retained on Sephadex beads, and when the mixture of xanthotoxin (8) and isopimpinellin (9) were extracted from cleaning Sephadex LH-20 column, the chlorination of aromatic system occurred in 8 giving 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen. These results showed that the use of cleaning Sephadex LH-20, deserves more attention than it has received so far. 2.3. Identification of Known Compounds The major types of rutaceous secondary metabolites were also isolated and they show that H. oreadica, H.brasiliana and H. superba are related to other species of Hortia. However, the alkaloids N-methylatanine, robustine [26,27], 7,8-dehydrorutaecarpine [28], edulitine [29], integriquinolone [30], the coumarins psoralen, bergapten, xanthotoxin, 5-methoxyseselin, braylin, isopimpinellin, prangol, heraclenol, seselin, 5-methoxyseselin [31], the flavonoids isosakuranetin [32], acacetin [29], neoponcirin [33], and the limonoid limonin [34] are reported for the first time from the Hortia. Groppo and collaborators [35,36] studying plants of the genus Hortia showed that H. brasiliana, H. arborea, H. colombiana and H. chocoensis represent the same arborescent species, and that H. brasiliana V. and ex. DC. H. badinii M.A. Lisboa was used to designate individuals of Hortia, but this error was corrected by Groppo and collaborators [35], who recognized it as H. brasiliana. The name H. brasiliana was wrongly applied to a shrubby species of central Brazil by Saint-Hilaire, today recognized as H. oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani [35]. H. superba Ducke, H. regia Sandwith and H. longifolia Spruce (ex. Engl) are accepted species in the genus Hortia according to Groppo and Pirani [36]. The known compounds isolated in this work and occurrences in other Hotia species can be seen in supplementary Table S1. 3. Experimental Section 3.1. Instrumentation Optical rotations were measured by using a Perkin Elmer 241 spectropolarimeter, or DIP 370 Jasco. High resolution EI-MS: VG Autospec-Fisons by using electron ionization technique at 70 eV (linked scan at 8 keV collisions with Helium); HRESI-MS analyses were performed on an UltroTOF-Q (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) fitted with an electrospray ion source operating in the positive ion mode; the accuracy masses were obtained by using of TFA-Na+ (sodiated trifluoroacetic acid) as internal standard; samples were directly infused into the ionization source at a flow rate of 10 µL/min the source block and desolvation temperature was 150 °C. IR: Bomen-Ft/IR. FEG-SEM Molecules 2014, 19 12041 micrographs: Supra 35-VP, Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany. NMR: Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard. All the solid state NMR experiments were performed in a Bruker Avance III 400 machine, operating at a 9.4 T magnetic field, which corresponds to 399.94 MHz for 1H, 100.57 MHz for 13C and 39.206 MHz for 35Cl resonance frequencies. This machine is equipped with a MAS 4mm broadband solid state probehead. The sample (powdered) was packed in a 4mm zirconia rotor, and a KEL-F cap. The carbon-13 1D spectra were obtained by using a ramped cross polarization under magic angle spinning with total side band suppression (pulse sequence named CPTOSS). These experiments were conducted at 298 K and using a spinning speed of 5000 Hz. The CPTOSS parameters were: contact time of 2 ms, recycle delay of 5 s, acquisition time of 34 ms, spectral width of 295 ppm and 512 scans were averaged. High power decoupling was done by using a TPPM15 decoupler program under a 1H field of 70 KHz. 2D 1H-13C FSLG-HETCOR experiment were run at 10,000 Hz of spinning speed. The pulse sequence parameters were: recycle delay of 2 s, contact time of 200 μs for observing spin diffusion signals, number of scans of 32, LG field of 80 Khz, acquisition time of 16 ms and SPINAL64 for decoupler program at 70KHz of 1H irradiation, and 256 transients were obtained in F1. FSLG-HETCOR was performed at only 298 K, in a total time of 4.5 h. The pulse sequence used for acquiring 35Cl solid state NMR was one pulse with acquisition time of 44 ms, a spectral window of 1200 ppm and the spinning speed was 10,000 Hz. For all the experiments the sample was spun by using gaseous nitrogen. FT Raman: I-Raman 485-H, Laser 785 nm BWTEK (USA). XRF: MiniPal 4, PW 4024, P Analytical B.V. (Almelo, The Netherlands). 3.2. Cleaning Sephadex LH-20 and Repacked Column When a column has been in use for some time, it may be necessary to remove contaminants. Thus the gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by gentle agitation and was allowed to react overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was washed three times with sterile distilled water to remove residual NaOCl. After cleaning, the column was carefully re-equilibrated with 2–3 column volumes of methanol before it is used again. Part of cleaning Sephadex was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis. The control gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed only with sterile distilled water by gentle agitation and was allowed to swell overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis. 3.3. Plant Material Hortia brasiliana V. and Ex. D.C. was collected (May 2000) in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. H. oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani was collected (September 2005) in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. H. superba Ducke was collected (December 2001) in road from Manaus to Itacoatiara km 31, Amazonas state, Brazil. All the plants were identified by José Rubens Pirani of the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo, and vouchers are deposited in the herbarium of the same department (Pirani 4672 and Groppo Jr. 458, Groppo Jr. 950, respectively).

Small branches of H. superba were also analyzed, and ground branches (483 g) were extracted 3 times at room temperature using ethanol. All extracts were monitored by 1H-NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS. Only those displaying features of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives and limonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. These extracts were repeatedly purified by silica gel column chromatography (CC, 230–400 mesh), gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH-20), preparative TLC, by the centrifugal preparative TLC performed on a chromatotron of Harrison research 50B, Spectra/Chrom CF1-fraction collector, silica gel 375 mesh, diameter 26 cm, and then by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification (polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G).

Conclusions This study shows that H. oreadica taproots appear to be a rich source of complex limonoids. By contrast, other organs of Hortia species have long been the subject of chemical investigation, which have found many typically rutaceous compounds but the limonoids are simple and less abundant than in the H. oreadica taproots. Therefore, all Hortia roots or taproots should be re-examined for limonoids. Clearly further chemical investigations on the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite will be essential to better understand the structures of the products formed. Additional experiments by enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain the main oxidized components soluble for NMR and MS analysis are in progress. However, information on the risks to recover Sephadex LH-20 with NaOCl must be clarified immediately, to avoid publication of possible chlorinated compounds as a natural occurrence.

(Received: July 22, 2008 - Accepted: May 13, 2009) ABSTRACT As part of our ongoing bioprospecting studies on secondary metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of São Paulo State (Brazil), we describe the identification of triterpenes and sterols present in the hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax of Pterogyne nitens Tulasne (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) using high resolution gas chromatography. Compounds detected in these extracts include β-amyrin (1), taraxerol acetate (2), lupenone (3), β-amyrenone (4), germanicone (5), campesterol (6), stigmasterol (7), and β-sitosterol (8). The method reported herein is shown to be a rapid, sensitive and reproducible tool for describing triterpenes and sterols present in non-polar extracts. Keywords: Pterogyne nitens; Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae; sterols; triterpenes; gas chromatography. INTRODUCTION Nature is an extremely rich source of highly diverse and innovative chemical structures, which have played a significant role in the process of drug discovery and design.1,2 In this context, there has been renewed alert in the rapid rate of plant species extinction3, which reduces the time left to explore the remaining resources of natural compounds. Urgent efforts are thus mandatory to speed up collection and selection of plants for chemical-biological investigation and possible conservation for future beneficial use of humankind.4 Among legumes of the Caesalpinioideae subfamily, Pterogyne nitens Tul. popularly named “bálsamo”, “cocal”, “amendoim-bravo”, “yvi-raró” is the sole member of the genus, and has been submitted to a strong anthropogenic impact, which has led to its numerical population retraction, and classification into the category of species in critical risk. It is found only in small non-protected areas in South America, and is therefore, subjected to the prompt possibility of extinction5-7. Regarding ethnopharmacological information, this legume is used for treatment of parasitic infestations, mainly Ascaris lumbricoides.8 In previous chemical reports, the chromatographic fractionation of the extract from the leaves furnished cytotoxic guanidine alkaloids.9,10 Recent works on the leaves and fruits led to a series of flavonols and flavones which exhibited myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging properties.11-14 In this work, we have employed high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) to investigate the sterols and triterpenes from P. nitens, as a promising tool to our bioprospecting activities within program BIOTA-FAPESP (The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program), which aims to inventory and characterize the biodiversity of São Paulo State, and explore mechanisms for its conservation and sustainable use. EXPERIMENTAL Plant material The leaves, stems, fruits and flowers of Pterogyne nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003 and identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Preparation of the hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax Each plant material (50.0 g) was dried at 40 oC, powdered and extracted exhaustively at room temperature with hexane (200 mL, 5 days x 3). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure in a rotatory evaporator (< 40 oC) to yield dried hexane extracts from leaves (3.1 g), stems (1.8 g), fruits (2.5 g) and flowers (1.7 g). Fresh leaves (100.0 g) were individually dipped for ca. 5 s into 50 mL dichloromethane. After filtration to remove plant debris, the solvent was evaporated using a stream of gaseous nitrogen affording a foliar epicuticular wax (87.0 mg) which was immediately analyzed by HRGC. Samples clean-up Samples of each crude extract (10 mg) were dissolved in chloroform (3.0 mL) and percolated through chromatographic column over celite:norit (1:1, 100.0 mg) + silica gel (200.0 mg) eluted with chloroform (10.0 mL). After evaporation to dryness at room temperature, the eluate was dissolved in hexane: ethyl acetate (7:3) and analyzed by HRGC in three replicates. Gas chromatographic conditions All the extracts were analyzed by HRGC on a Varian model CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with split injector [initial splitless; 0.75 min (1:50); 2.00 min (1:20)] at 260 ºC, and flame ionization detector at 310 ºC for SPB- 5 column and 290 ºC for SPB-50 column. The injected volume was 2.0 µL. SPB-50 (cross-linked 50% phenyl-methyl-siloxane, 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm) and SPB-5 (cross-linked 5% phenyl-methyl-siloxane, 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm) capillary columns were employed. In the case of SPB-50, the column temperature was 280 ºC (isotherm), whereas for SPB-5, a column temperature program was employed in which the initial temperature was 250 ºC, held for 12 min, followed by a temperature increase of 6 ºC min-1 to 280 ºC, then held for additional 30 min. Nitrogen was employed as carrier gas at an average linear velocity of 1 mL/min. Triterpenes and sterols were identified by comparison of the relative retention (RR) of the samples with the RR of the standard sterols and triterpenes. Cholesterol was used as internal standard. Authentic standard sterols and triterpenes Triterpenes and steroids used as standards were previously isolated from Lauraceae and Rubiaceae species, including Alibertia macrophylla, A. sessilis, Licaria rodriguesii, L. subbulata, and Aniba parviflora. Their molecular structures were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS techniques.15-17 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Hexane extracts from leaves, fruits, flowers and stems of P. nitens, in addition to the foliar epicuticular wax were analyzed by HRGC using a method which does not require pre-derivatizations. The GC-FID method used in this study employed two different columns: SPB-5 and SPB-50, which were used due to their low polarity, inertness towards organic compounds and high temperature limit. Such features make them ideal for the analysis of underivatized semi-volatile plant extracts. The chromatogram obtained in SPB-50 column for the hexane extract from P. nitens stems evidences good resolution of peaks and thus proper identification of major components by comparison of RR (relative retention) values with those of authentic samples (Figure 1A). The presence of each triterpene or sterol was additionally confirmed by co-injection with authentic standards to avoid misclassifications due to overlapping of retention zones. e-mail: dhsilva@iq.unesp.br J.

(+) presence of the compound; (-) absence of the compound. Our results indicate that β-sitosterol (8) is present in all the analyzed extracts. Additional widely occurring sterols: campesterol (6) and stigmasterol (7), were also characterized in all analyzed hexane extracts, except from the leaves. The pentacyclic triterpenes β-amyrin (1) and lupenone (3) were detected in the stems and flowers, whereas germanicone (5) was identified in the leaves and stems; and β-amyrenone (4) was detected in the flowers extract. Further GC-FID analyses of foliar epicuticular wax showed the presence of 1, 5 and, taraxerol acetate (2). These results clearly demonstrate that the hexane extracts from stems and flowers present higher chemodiversity than the others. On the other hand their chemical profile indicated common major constituents concerning sterols and triterpenes in the analyzed samples evidencing great similarity among the studied plant part extracts. Altogether, these results corroborate differences in the secondary metabolites production by different plant tissues, which can be relevant from the point of view of the chemical interface between plants and the surrounding environment.18 In this context, several studies indicated variable production of secondary metabolites by medicinal plants.19 Zangerl and Bazzaz reported different levels of furanocoumarins from Pastinaca sativa (Apiaceae) leaves and roots.20 Likewise, Rees described flowers of Hypericum hirsutum (Clusiaceae) contain five to ten times more hypericin that the leaves.21 Considering that young leaves and other growing plant parts are generally better protected by secondary compounds than mature tissues, young leaves of rosette plants of Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae) were found to contain up to 53 times higher levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids than older leaves.22 In the case of non-polar extracts, bioactivity has been often associated with complex mixtures of triterpenoid and/or steroid compounds23-26. However, no further analysis/identification of the mixture components is subsequently performed in most cases due to two reasons: Firstly, traditional phytochemical procedures, which include isolation of the components from isomeric mixtures, may be tedious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. Secondly, due to their structural complexity the analysis of triterpenes and sterols by spectroscopic techniques has been shown to be difficult in many cases. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has emerged as the best technique for characterization of low-polarity compounds, including triterpenes, sterols, glycerols, waxes, and derivatized fatty acids. However, this hyphenated analytical technique is still inaccessible to many research groups around the world. On the other hand, GC is more readily available and might also be employed as a preliminary procedure for rapid, simple, and relatively cheap characterization of non-polar compounds from plant extracts, including epicuticular waxes. The present phytochemical screening using HRGC showed to be reliable and useful for the identification of triterpenes and sterols in complex matrices such as hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax from P. nitens (Figure 2). Other interesting applications of this technique include the selection of plant extracts containing bioactive non-polar compounds for further phytochemical and pharmacological investigations, which may represent a crucial step in bioprospecting studies and corroborates its importance as a tool for conducting phytochemical studies.

INTRODUÇÃO Vochysia thyrsoidea Pohl., conhecida como gomeira, pau-de-go ma, casca-doce, árvore do vinho, vinheiro-do-campo, goma-arábica, goma-arábica-da-lagoa-santa, é uma Vochysiaceae encontrada em abundância no cerrado brasileiro e campos cerrados de altitude, usada na medicina popular como expectorante.1 O estudo prévio relacionado à caracterização química dos cons tituintes desta espécie revela o isolamento de dois ácidos elágicos (ácidos 3,3’,4-tri-O-metilelágico e 3,3’,4,4’-tetra-O-metilelágico) e das duas quinonas (1,8-dihidroxi-6-metoxi-3-metilantra-quinona e 2,6-dimetoxi-1,4-benzoquinona).2 Poucos estudos desta planta são descritos e não houve anteriormente avaliações de atividades biológicas para esta espécie. Este trabalho relata as atividades citotóxica e inibitória da ativi dade das catepsinas B e K de extratos (folhas e cascas) e compostos isolados das cascas do caule de V. thyrsoidea, bem como o isolamento e elucidação estrutural de duas catequinas (1-2) e de dois derivados butil-D-frutofuranosídeo (3-4) (Figura 1), além do ácido 2,4,6-trime toxibenzóico e ácido 3-oxo-urs-12en-28-oico. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentação e procedimentos gerais Os espectros de RMN 1H e 13C 1D/2D foram obtidos em espec trômetro Bruker modelos ARX 100 MHz e DRX 400 MHz, utili zando CD3OD e acetona-d6 como solventes e TMS como referência interna. O espectro de massas de alta resolução foi realizado em um equipamento da Bruker Daltonics, modelo micrOTOF - Q II – ESI – TOF. As separações cromatográficas em coluna à pressão atmos férica foram realizadas em sílica gel 60 (230 a 700 Mesh) da Merck e Sephadex LH-20 da Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB. As placas usadas para cromatografia em camada delgada analítica (CCDA) foram de cromatofolhas de alumínio de sílica gel 60 F254 da Merck. As revelações das cromatoplacas foram feitas através de luz UV (254 e 365 nm) e por borrifamento com solução de vanilina sulfúrica. Os Figura 1.

(Vochysiaceae) 289 Vol. 37, No. 2 solventes (etanol, metanol, hexano, acetato de etila, diclorometano e n-butanol) utilizados na preparação dos extratos e fracionamentos cromatográficos foram todos de grau analítico. Material vegetal O material botânico de V. thyrsoidea foi coletado na Serra dos Pirineus, Pirenópolis - GO, em março de 2010 e identificado pela Dra. Mirley Luciene dos Santos. A exsicata (no7051) encontra-se depositada no Herbário da Universidade Estadual de Goiás, Campus Henrique Santillo, Anápolis – GO. Isolamento dos constituintes químicos As cascas do caule (Cc; 1.465 g) e folhas (F; 1.140 g) de V.thyrsoidea, após secagem em estufa a 40 oC e moagem, foram extraídas com etanol. Após eliminação dos solventes sob pressão reduzida, os extratos brutos foram obtidos [Cc (23,0 g) e F (150,0g)]. O extrato oriundo das cascas do caule foi particionado com MeOH‑H2O (1:3) e solventes de diferentes polaridades [hexano (1,5g), CH2Cl2 (1,3g), AcOEt (7,3 g), n-BuOH (1,0 g) e hidroalcoólico (10,8 g)] enquanto que o das folhas foi fracionado com celulose microcristalina D, fornecendo os extratos em hexano (5,6 g), CH2Cl2 (15,8 g), AcOEt (52,3 g) e MeOH (50,7 g). A fração diclorometânica das cascas do caule (1,3 g) foi croma tografada em duas etapas utilizando cromatografia de adsorção em gel de sílica, ambas em eluição isocrática com Hex:AcOEt (8,5:1,5). Desta última etapa cromatográfica foram obtidas 11 frações, dentre as quais a segunda fração foi identificada por comparação dos dados espectroscópicos de RMN 1H e 13C com a literatura como o triterpeno ácido 3-oxo-urs-12en-28-oico (2,0 mg).3 A fração 7 (190,0 mg) foi refracionada por cromatografia de co luna de gel de sílica no modo isocrático Hex:AcOEt (7:3), trazendo o isolamento do ácido 2,4,6-trimetoxibenzóico (5,2 mg), cuja estrutura foi proposta com base em dados espectrais de de RMN 1H e 13C e comparação com a literatura.4 O fracionamento do extrato de AcOEt das cascas do caule (7,3 g) foi feito através de cromatografia em coluna (CC) de gel de sílica,usando como fase móvel os solventes AcOEt:MeOH com gradiente de eluição em ordem crescente de polaridade. Desta coluna obteve-se 85 frações, que foram submetidas à análise por CCDA e então reunidas em 4 frações. A segunda fração (1,0 g) foi submetida à CC de gel de sílica, usando como fase móvel CH2Cl2:MeOH (4:1) no modo isocrático de eluição, o qual proporcionou o isolamento da substância 1 (3,0 mg). Após sucessivos fracionamentos desta fração 2 por cromatografia de exclusão (Sephadex LH-20) e eluição em MeOH 100%, obteve-se a substância 2 (3,0 mg) identificada por RMN 1D/2D.5 Catequin-3-O-(3”-trans-cinamoil)-α-raminopiranosideo (1).

A fração n-butanólica das cascas do caule foi fracionada por CC de gel de sílica com CH2Cl2:MeOH (9:1) no modo isocrático de eluição, fornecendo 48 frações que foram reagrupadas em 5 novas frações após análise por CCDA. A segunda fração (300,0 mg) foi cromatografada por CC de gel de sílica no modo isocrático usando Hex:AcOEt (7:3), gerando 16 subfrações. Dentre estas, as subfrações 8 e 11 foram identificadas como substância 3 (20 mg) e 4 (10 mg), respectivamente. 1-Butil-D-frutofuranosideo (3).

Ensaio toxicológico Baseado na metodologia de Meyer et al. (1982), com algumas adaptações, foi preparado um ambiente adequado para o desenvol vimento da Artermia salina.6 Os extratos brutos e particionados da casca do caule e das folhas de V. thyrsoidea foram solubilizados em água salina e DMSO 1%, e partindo-se de soluções padrão efetuaram-se diluições. Foram separadas 10 larvas por tubo de ensaio contendo 10 mL das soluções nas concentrações de 125, 250 e 500 μg/mL em triplicata. Cada teste foi acompanhado de um controle negativo, solução salina, do veículo usado para diluir os extratos (DMSO 1%) e do controle positivo com K2Cr2O7 (DL50 = 20 a 40 ppm). As larvas A. salina em testes foram mantidas à temperatura ambiente (26 oC) sob iluminação artificial por um período de 24 horas. Após este período, foram realizadas leituras da contagem do número de larvas sobreviventes e mortas. A obtenção da dose que causa letalidade de 50% dos náuplios (DL50) foi feita por cálculos do método PROBIT de análise, por meio do software STATPLUS® 2005 (95% de confiança). Ensaio de atividade citotóxica in vitro As análises da citotoxicidade foram realizadas no Laboratório de Oncologia Experimental da Universidade Federal do Ceará por meio do método de MTT, que consiste em uma análise colorimétrica baseada na conversão do sal 3-(4,5-dimetil-2-tiazol)-2,5-difenil -brometo de tetrazolium (MTT) em azul de formazan, a partir de enzimas mitocondriais presentes em células metabolicamente ativas. As linhagens utilizadas, MDA-MB-435 (melanoma), HCT-8 (cólon humano), SF-295 (sistema nervoso central) e HL-60 (leuce mia), foram cedidas pelo Instituto Nacional do Câncer (USA), tendo sido cultivadas em frascos plásticos para cultura, utilizando o meio RPMI 1640 suplementado com 10% de soro fetal bovino e 1% de antibióticos (penicilina/estreptomicina). As células foram incubadas em estufa a 37 °C com atmosfera de 5% de CO2 e 95% de umidade, seguido da observação do crescimento celular com ajuda do microscópio de inversão a cada 24 horas. Quando necessário, as células foram repicadas em meio de cultura novo, em uma concentração de 1,0 x 105 céls/100μL. de Sousa et al. 290 Quim. Nova As substâncias foram diluídas em DMSO puro e estéril na con centração de 5μg/mL (dose única) e adicionadas em placas de 96 poços (100μL/poço), onde a análise de cada amostra foi feita a partir de dois experimentos realizados em duplicata, tendo como controle positivo o quimioterápico doxorrubicina. Após um período de incubação de 72 horas, a absorbância foi lida em um espectrofotômetro de placas (DTX 880 Multimode Detector) a um comprimento de onda de 550 nm.7 Os resultados foram analisa dos segundo suas médias e respectivos desvios-padrão no programa GraphPad Prism. Ensaio de inibição enzimática: catepsinas B e K Os ensaios de inibição enzimática frente à catepsina B e K foram realizados no Laboratório de Produtos Naturais da Universidade Federal de São Carlos, usando-se as mesmas condições experimentais para ambas as catepsinas. A metodologia aplicada, com algumas modificações, consiste na determinação da inibição enzimática através da detecção do aumento da fluorescência que ocorre com à hidrólise do substrato fluorogênico Z-FRMCA, o qual é detectado em espectrofluorímetro com fenda de excitação ajustada para λex= 380 nm e emissão λem= 460 nm.8 O modelo do espectrofluorímetro utilizado neste ensaio foi da Molecular Devices Corporation – Spetra MAX M3 GEMINI XS. Os ensaios foram feitos em triplicatas, nos quais as amostras foram diluídas em DMSO, obtendo uma concentração final do composto de 125 μM. Um volume de 5 μL foi transferido para cada poço das placas de ELISA (96 poços) e adicionou-se o MIX 1 e a enzima em concen tração 3mM em tampão (acetato de sódio 100 mM com 5 mM de EDTA e pH de 5,5) pré-ativada com DTE (5,0 mM) aos analitos. A enzima ficou em contato com os compostos por 5 minutos e poste riormente foram adicionados 10 μM do MIX 2 (substrato fluorogênico Z-FRMCA em tampão), realizando-se a leitura em seguida. Para os compostos que apresentaram inibição significativa (supe rior ou igual a 80%) frente às enzimas testadas foram determinados os valores de IC50. O potencial de inibição foi determinado utilizando-se dez diferentes concentrações do inibidor e construindo uma curva de concentração x resposta pelo método de regressão não-linear do programa Origin. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A substância1 foi identificada pela análise dos espectros de RMN 1H, HSQC e HMBC (Tabela 1) e massas de alta resolução (HRESIMS) em comparação com a literatura.5,9 O espectro de massas de alta resolução foi obtido no modo nega tivo, e exibiu um pico característico do íon em 549,1755 [M – H]–, sugerindo a fórmula molecular C30H30O10. No espectro de RMN de 1H a substância 1 apresentou sinais na região de hidrogênios alifáticos [δ4,69 (d; J= 7,6 Hz), 3,98 (m), δ 2,97 (dd; J= 15,2 e 5,2 Hz) e 2,71 (dd; J= 15,6 e 8,4 Hz)], característicos dos hidrogênios H-2, H-3 e dos hidrogênios diastereotópicos H-4a e H-4b respectivamente. Na região de deslocamentos químicos de hidrogênios aromáticos os sinais em δ5,95 (d) e 5,86 (d) com cons tante de acoplamento de J= 2,4 Hz referem-se ao acoplamento entre os hidrogênios H-6 e H-8. Os dois dubletos em δ 7,27 (d) e 6,80 (d) com J= 8,4 Hz foram atribuídos aos hidrogênios H-2’, H-6’, H-3’ e H-5’ referente a um sistema de acoplamento de spins AA’XX’. Tabela 1.

(Vochysiaceae) 291 Vol. 37, No. 2 A presença do resíduo de açúcar nesta estrutura foi observada pela presença dos sinais entre δ 3,62 e 4,19 de hidrogênios carbi nólicos. A caracterização da α-ramnose foi então realizada com base no sinal do dubleto em δ 1,30 (d, J= 6,4 Hz) referente ao acoplamento dos hidrogênios da metila (H-6”) com H-5”, bem como pelo dubleto em δ 4,19 (J= 1,8 Hz) referente ao acoplamento diequatorial de H-1” e H-2”.5 A unidade trans-cinamoíla presente pôde ser observada pelo conjunto de sinais no espectro de RMN 1H, onde na região de aro máticos um conjunto de dois dubletos em δ 7,76 e 6,58 (H- 7”’ e H-8”’), ambos com J=16 Hz integrando para um hidrogênio cada, caracterizou o acoplamento em trans. Os multipletos em [δ 7,61 (m; H-2”’ e H-6”’) e 7,40 (m; H-3”’, H-4”’ e H-5”’)] apresentaram um padrão de acoplamento típico de anel aromático monossubstituído. No experimento de HMBC observou-se que o dubleto em δH 4,19 referente ao hidrogênio anomérico da ramnose (H-1”) apresentou correlação com o sinal em δC 76,0 (C-3), confirmando que a unidade de ramnose encontra-se ligada à posição 3 do flavonoide. Também foi possível por este experimento observar as correlações do sinal em δH 7,76 (H-7”’) com os sinais em δC 119,4 (C-8”’), δ 136,0 (C-1”’) e δ 168,2 (C-9”’). A ligação da unidade cinamoíla ao oxigênio do carbono C-3” (δC 73,5) da ramnose foi confirmada através dos sinais δH5,02/ δC 168,2 que correspondem à correlação do H-3” e o carbono da carbonila (C-9”’) (Figura 2). Uma substância estruturalmente relacionada a este flavonoide (1), o canferol 3-O-α-L-(4”-E-p-cumaroil)-raminosideo foi relatada anteriormente em Qualea grandiflora Mart. (Vochysiaceae).5 Os frutofuranosídeos tiveram suas estruturas determinadas por meio da comparação da literatura com os dados experimentais de RMN 1H, HSQC, HMBC, DEPT 135 e reação de acetilação utilizando DMAP como catalisador.10 O espectro de RMN de 1H da substância 3 apresentou um triple to bastante intenso em δ 0,92 (t; 3H) referente aos hidrogênios da metila; um sexteto em δ 1,38 integrando para dois hidrogênios e um quinteto em δ 1,51referente aos hidrogênios metilênicos H-b e H-c. O duplo-dubleto em δ 3,47 (dd; J= 6,7 e 9,1 Hz) indicou a presença de uma unidade O-glicosídica que provocou a desblindagem destes hidrogênios metilênicos da cadeia alquílica (H-d). A substância 4 também apresentou na região entre 0,9-3,5 ppm o mesmo padrão de multiplicidade de sinais encontrados na substância 3, que juntamente com o número de hidrogênios estimados pela integral confirmaram também a presença de um grupo butila. Nestes espectros observa -se ainda a presença de sinais na região entre δ 3,40-4,2 referente à presença de uma unidade de açúcar. No experimento de DEPT 135o foram observados quatro sinais positivos (CH e CH3) e cinco sinais negativos (CH2), os quais foram atribuídos aos respectivos carbonos pela comparação com os deslo camentos químicos assinalados anteriormente (HSQC). Os sinais em δC 62,3 e 62,0 pertencem aos carbonos C-6 e C-1 do açúcar confirmando a frutofuranose pela presença de dois grupos metilênicos. O sinal negativo em δC 65,0 refere-se ao C-d (OCH2) e os outros dois sinais em δC 33,5 e 20,5 correspondem aos grupos CH2 da cadeia alquílica. O sinal em δC 14,4 é referente à metila da cadeia alquílica (C-a) e os outros três sinais (δC 83,3, 78,5 e 77,3) são respectivamente dos carbonos do açúcar C-5, C-3 e C-4. A posição do grupo alquila ligado à unidade de açúcar foi determi nada por meio do experimento de HMBC, que apresentou a correlação entre os sinais δC 65,0/δH3,70 e 3,62 atribuídos, respectivamente, aos H-1 e H-1’ e o C-d da cadeia alquílica. A substância 4 foi diferenciada da substância 3 com base nos sinais de carbono projetados no espectro de HMBC. A correlação do H-d(δH 3,51) e o C-c (δC 33,3), bem como a correlação deste hidrogênio (H-d) e o C-2 (δC 103,0) confirmaram a ligação da cadeia alquílica à unidade de açúcar no C-2.10 Ensaios biológicos A análise dos resultados do teste TAS, segundo Meyer,6 foi realizada por meio de uma relação entre a dose letal média, DL50, e o grau de toxicidade, nos quais consideram-se tóxico valores de DL50<1000 μg/mL. Todos os extratos testados, exceto o hexânico das folhas (DL50<1000 μg/mL), apresentaram toxicidade frente a A. salina [cascas do caule: 283,94 (EtOH), 499,60 (hexano), 288,33 (CH2Cl2) e 476,58 (AcOEt) μg/mL; folhas: 209,08 (EtOH), 921,47 (CH2Cl2), 32,06 (AcOEt) e 151,90 (MeOH) μg/mL]. Os ensaios de toxicidade frente a esta espécie de microcrustá ceo apresentam correlação com diversas atividades biológicas,11 e baseando-se nas substâncias obtidas no estudo fitoquímico foram realizados ensaios de inibição enzimática e de citotoxicidade. Das frações do extrato bruto das cascas do caule e folhas de V. thyrsoidea avaliadas, nenhuma demonstrou potencial citotóxico rele vante (percentual de inibição do crescimento tumoral maior que 80%) para as linhagens celulares tumorais testadas, MDA-MB-435 (mela noma), HCT-8 (cólon-humano), SF-295 (sistema nervoso central). Dentre os compostos avaliados, o 2-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo apresentou valores significativos de toxicidade com IC50=36,80 µM frente às células tumorais do sistema nervoso central (SF-295) e IC50=25,37 µM em linhagem HL-60 (leucemia humana). Os compostos testados não apresentaram inibição frente à catespina K, entretanto frente à catepsina B obteve-se um resulta do de inibição enzimática moderado, apresentado pelo composto catequina-3-O-(3”-trans-cinamoil)-α-ramnopiranosídeo (1), com IC50=62,02 (+/-0,79 µM). CONCLUSÃO O trabalho contribuiu com a caracterização fitoquímica da planta V. thyrsoideaatravés do isolamento do catequin-3-O-(3”-trans- cinamoil)-α-ramnopiranosídeo, catequin-3-O-α-ramnopiranosídeo, 1-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo, 2-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo, ácido 2,4,6-trimetoxibenzóico e ácido 3-oxo-urs-12en-28-oico. Dentre as substâncias isoladas, os flavonoides e os frutofura nosídeos são relatados pela primeira vez no gênero Vochysia, e a substânciacatequin-3-O-(3”-trans-cinamoil)-α-ramnopiranosídeo, a qual apresentou moderada atividade inibitória frente a catepsina B, foi descrita pela primeira vez na literatura. Em relação à atividade citotóxica, o 2-butil-D-frutofuranosídeo foi a substância que apresentou o resultado mais significativo de inibição das células tumorais do sistema nervoso central e leucemia humana.
