The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artiﬁcial diet at 1 mg g−1 and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superﬁcial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g−1. Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic S. densiﬂora extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from V. polygama were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, ﬂavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition. 2006 Society of Chemical Industry Keywords: Tarum˜a; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; Vitex polygama; Siphoneugena densiﬂora; Spodoptera frugiperda; botanical insecticide; pest control 1 INTRODUCTION With a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efﬁcacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3 Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noc- tuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important ﬁeld crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by con- suming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4 Of the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, Vitex polygama Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5–9 This plant is commonly called ‘Maria-Preta’, ‘Tarum˜a’, ‘Congonha-cinco-folhas’ and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, Siphoneugena densiﬂora Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in S˜ao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named ‘Uvatinga’,13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack. ∗Correspondence to: Margareth BC Gallo, Departamento de Qu´ımica, Universidade Federal de S ˜ao Carlos (UFSCar), CP 676, 13565-905, S ˜ao Carlos-SP, Brazil E-mail: marejor@uol.com.br †This paper was given in part at the XX Brazilian Congress of Entomology, Gramado-RS-Brazil, 5-10 September 2004, Abstract EN-335, p. 341.

Pest Manag Sci 1526–498X/2006/$30.00 Natural products active against S. frugiperda Even though the selected plant species have not been ordinarily employed in pest control, their families comprise several species with injurious properties to insects reported in the literature.15–21 The present paper speciﬁcally deals with the effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from V. polygama and S. densiﬂora against fall armyworm (S. frugiperda). Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 General Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, J 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethanol) from Aldrich Chemi- cal Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck- Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei M¨unchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low- resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple- quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectropho- tometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pel- lets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Aus- tralia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 × 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70–230 or 230–400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), SephadexLH-20 (25–100 µm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7(Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled. 2.2 Plants Vitex polygama and Siphoneugena densiﬂora were collected in July 2000, in the city of Po¸cos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, Brazil, respectively. 2.3 Extraction and isolation The powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after ﬁltration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 ◦C. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 × 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting ﬁltrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1. Compounds 1 to 43 were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (1, 9, 14 to 18, 25, 26 and 43; see Fig. 1) are described below. Some of them, like compounds 15 and 16, were isolated from more than one different extract of the same plant. 2.3.1 Isolation of compounds 13 to 19 from Siphoneugena densiﬂora (SD-EMR layer) A quantity of 9 g of SD-EMR (Table 1) was subjected to CC using silica gel (38.0 × 5.0 cm) with dichloromethane + ethyl acetate (7 + 3 by volume) as eluent and gradient elution.

Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with methanol. A total of 23 fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven fractions (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase methanol, ﬂowrate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield compound 1 (ﬁrst peak, 5.5 mg) and substances 7 and 8, identiﬁed as a mixture, (second peak, 3.1 mg), after three cycles of 54 min. 2.3.5 Isolation of compounds 9 to 11 from Vitex polygama (VP-EMT layer) A quantity of 1.9 g and 900 mg of VP-EMT layer (Table 1) were submitted to column chromatogra- phy (3.0 × 46.0 cm) using SephadexLH-20 and methanol as eluent. A total of 23 fractions of 50 mL were collected. Similar fractions were combined, yield- ing seven fractions (EMT1 to EMT7). Fraction 3 (EMT3, 551.0 mg) was rechromatographed over sil- ica gel (230–400 mesh) using gradient elution from ethyl acetate + dichloromethane (9 + 1 by volume) to methanol; 60 fractions of 50 mL were obtained and combined into 17 fractions (EMT3a to EMT3r). Frac- tion 5 (EMT3e, 140.5 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative TLC on silica gel 60 F254 with double development, using dichloromethane + acetone (1 + 1 by volume) as mobile phase and UV detection, yielding com- pounds 9 (77.7 mg), 10 (11.0 mg) and 11 (14.3 mg) respectively. 2.4 Insect rearing Larvae of S. frugipereda used in the experiments were obtained from cultures at the Departamento de Entomologia, Fitopatologia e Zoologia Agr´ıcola of the Escola Superior de Agronomia Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo (ESALQ/USP), and maintained in environmental chambers at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod. The artiﬁcial diet used for the bioassay and previously described22 contained cooked ‘carioca’ bean 37.5 g, 1076 Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) DOI: 10.1002/ps Natural products active against S. frugiperda wheat germ 30.0 g, soy meal 15.0 g, casein 15.0 g, yeast extract 18.75 g, tetracycline 56.5 mg, agar 11.5 g, Vanderzant vitamin mixture for insects 4.5 mL, ascorbic acid 1.8 g, sorbic acid 0.9 g, methyl p- hydroxybenzoate 1.5 g, formaldehyde (40% v/v) 1.8 mL and distilled water 600 mL, in a total volume of 720 mL. 2.5 Toxicity bioassays by ingestion against Spodoptera frugiperda 2.5.1 Crude extracts and layers A quantity of 100 mg of crude extracts or fractions was diluted in a small volume of acetone (e.g. 2 mL) along with ascorbic acid (ingredient of the artiﬁcial diet). The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg g−1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 × 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 ◦C), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot’s formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 × 6.0 cm) containing ﬁlter paper at the bottom (4.0 × 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10–20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence. The control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls. 2.5.2 Isolated compounds Four well plates (24 × 1.5 mL wells) were ﬁlled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar ﬂow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 µL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artiﬁcial congealed diet. The ﬁnal concentration was about 0.1 mg g−1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar S. frugiperda larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbott’s formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound. 2.6 Statistical analysis Data consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA).

S. densiﬂora polar extracts (SD-ML, SD-HAL, SD- MS, SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, SD- HAR) were responsible for the highest mortalities (100%), followed by VP-HAL (60%), VP-HF (90%) and VP-HAF (100%) extracts from Vitex polygama, taking into account the treatment period (Table 2). They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid–liquid partition. Partition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD- AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2). The VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of Vitex madiensis caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in S. frugiperda.30 Ecdysteroids 9 to 12 (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract. Flavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufﬁcient amounts to be bioassayed. The ﬂavonoids quercetin (25) and quercitrin (26) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (25) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450- dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione S-transferases from S. frugiperda.35 In addition, quercitrin (26), a ﬂavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not signiﬁcantly different (P < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound 17, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity. 3.3 Developmental effects In general, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP- HL and VP-HF, which showed signiﬁcantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage. Compound 9, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statis- tically signiﬁcant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (P < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmen- tal stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result. Although the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds 14 and 43 (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins 15 and 17 were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea- Bulla et al.,38 gallic acid (13), the compound isolated from several extracts of S. densiﬂora and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound 14, signiﬁcantly reduces larval growth of S. frugiperda at 1 mg g−1. 4 CONCLUSIONS Polar extracts from S. densiﬂora and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efﬁcient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of S. frugiperda. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin 14 along with the insecticidal effects of ﬂavonoids 25 and 26 might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound 14 might be acting synergistically with 43, and in concert with daucosterol (19), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid 13 and other Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) 1079 DOI: 10.1002/ps MBC Gallo et al. compound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.

Introduction Styracaceae is a family constituted of small trees and shrubs, mostly native to tropical and subtropical regions (Pio Correa, 1931). The genus Styrax is dierent from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat in¯ammatory dis- eases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styr- acaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985; Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988; Anil, 1980; Segal et al., 1967, 1964; Ulubelen et al., 1978; Kawai and Sugimota, 1940; Kitagawa et al., 1974; Ulubelen, 1976; Nakano et al., 1967). From the leaves of Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (4) and the known nor-lig- nans 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methyl- enedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1), 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7- methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2), 5- [300-(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(30,40- methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (3) and the lignan di- hydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (5), together with urso- lic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds 1±2 showed inhibitory proper- ties against the microorganisms, Candida albicans, Clado- sporium cladosporioides and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elu- cidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and 2). 2. Results and discussion The dried and powdered leaves of Styrax ferrugineus were extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2ÐCH3OH (2:1 v/v). Evaporation gave an extract, which showed 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The bioactive extract was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with n-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc (4300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by puri®cation on preparative HPLC aorded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (4) and the known nor-lignans (1) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (2) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and (3) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (5) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identi®ed by chromato- graphic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The tri- terpenes and sterols were identi®ed by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13C NMR spectral data for 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylene- dioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) and 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)- 7-methoxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13C NMR spectral data for 1 and 2 are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC corre- lations are presented in Fig. 1. Compound 2 was obtained earlier from the seeds of S. ocinalis (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent puri®cation of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of S. camporum (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucida- tion of compound (4) as well as the antimicrobial activ- ities of all lignoids isolated. Compound 4 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The molecular formula C26H32O10 was deduced from ES-MS m/z [M+Na]+ 527, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. Its IR spectrum recorded hydroxyl (3550±3200 cmÿ 1), unsaturated (1650 cmÿ 1) and aromatic (1550, 870 cmÿ 1) absorptions, and its UV absorbance Table 1 1H NMR spectral data (400 MHz) of 2 and 4a Proton 4b,c COSY 3 7.17 s 4 7.11 d (1.9) H-6 6 6.77 d (1.9) H-4 20 7.41 d (1.9) H-60 50 7.05 d (8.0) H-60 60 7.44 dd (1.9; 8.0) H-20,60 100 2.75 t (7.5) H-200 200 1.86 dt (7.8) H-100,300 300 3.66 t (7.8) H-200,100 1000 4.11 d (8.0) H-300 2000 4.33 m H-1000,3000 3000 3.45 m H-2000,4000 4000 3.62 t (9.0) H-3000,5000 5000 3.64 ddd (9.0, 5.0, 3.0) H-4000,6000 6000 4.23 dd (12.0, 5.0) H-6a000,H-5000 4.20 dd (12.0, 3.0) OCH3-30 3.83 s OCH3-40 3.88 s OCH3-70 3.99 s a Chemical shifts are expressed in values.

The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Tables 1 and 2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 4 with those described for 2 indi- cated that 4 is a glucoside derivative of compound 2. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 displayed four doublets at 6.77 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at 7.44 (1H, dd, J=1.9; 8.0 Hz) attri- butable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at 7.17 (1H, s) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, s), two triplets due to methylene protons at 2.75 (2H, t, J=7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, t, J=7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at 1.86 (2H, dt, J=7.8 Hz). This 1H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of com- pound 2. Further analysis of the 1H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet at 4.11 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and several signals at 4.33±3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound 4. The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 2) suggested the presence of a nor-lignan with similar ske- leton to 2. The main dierence observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 4 was due to the presence of the signals at 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH2) which con®rmed a glucosyl moiety. The 1H±±1H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. 1H±13C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. 1H±13C-three-bond (HMBC) correla- tions from the H-100 protons resonances at 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at 107.64 and 112.12 identi®ed the later as C-4. The 3J HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-30 and C-40 quaternary carbons with H-20 and H-60 proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-tri- substituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound 4. Other signi®cant correlations for con®rmation of 4 are depicted in Fig. 1. The extract and compounds isolated from S. ferrugi- neus were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively. Compounds 1±2 exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus C. sphaer- ospermum could be predictive for the activity against C. albicans. In conclusion, the activities of compounds 1±5 may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infec- tions in several Brazilian regions. 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin±Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for 1H and 50 MHz for 13C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90 and 135, respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70±230 and 230±400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H2SO4 after heating. 3.2. Plant material Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart.

Bioassay The crude extract and puri®ed lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium S. aureus ATCC 12228, the fungus C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast C. albicans ICB 12. Stock solu- tions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure com- pounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appro- priate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on pre- coated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as posi- tive and negative controls, respectively. For the anti- fungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened cham- ber at 27C. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with C. albicans and S. aureus were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of C. albicans and S. aureus in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30C for 24 h. 3.4. Extraction Dried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of Styrax ferrugi- neus Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH2Cl2±CH3OH (2:1, v/v) at room tempera- ture. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH±H2O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc. After removal of the sol- vent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respec- tively. The CHCl3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel ¯ash (77.9 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gra- dient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5- (300-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methylenedioxy- phenyl)benzofuran (1), and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(300 -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40 -dimethoxy- phenyl)benzofuran (2). Fr. 40±41 (39.4 mg) was fractio- nated by micron silica gel ¯ash CC (Merck) using CH2Cl2±CH3OH (95:5) as eluent to aord 11 Frs. Frs. 5±9 gave a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52±55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica ¯ash CC (11.6 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using Hex±EtoAc±CH3OH (6:2:2) as eluent to aord 20 Frs. Frs 6±12 furnished dihydrodehydiconiferyl alcohol (5) (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH2Cl2±CH3OH gradient yielded 22 Frs. Fr. 20 (13.8 mg) gave a mixture of 3+4, which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-18 column) using a mixture of CH3OH± H2O (4:6) as eluent to aord compounds 3 (4.0 mg) and 4 (5.8 mg). 3.4.1. 5-(300-Hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(30,40-methy- lenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) White amorphous powder; IR max (KBr) 3432, 2926, 1606, 1476, 1232, 1148, 1037, 931 cmÿ 1; ES-MS [M+Na]+ m/z 349, ES-MS [M+K]+ m/z 365.

Hydrolysis of 4. A solution containing glucoside 4 (2.0 mg) in 3 M HCl (5 ml) was heated until re¯ux began, this being maintained for 4 h. The reaction mix- ture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 1% NaOH and extracted with CHCl3 (310 ml). The reaction mixture was puri®ed on CC silica gel using CH2Cl2±CH3OH (99:1) as eluent to obtain 2 (1.0 mg) which showed the same Rf [0.5 CH2Cl2±CH3OH (98:2)], IR and 1H of authentic 5-(300-hydroxypropyl)-7-meth- oxy-2-(30,40-dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Identi®- cation of the glucose obtained as a product of the reaction was con®rmed after reaction of the aqueous fraction with an enzymatic kit based on glucose oxidase, this being speci®c for glucose and yielding a positive response (Trinder, 1969). 600 P.M.

Gottlieb's 80th birthday Abstract Two C,O-diglycosylated compounds, the anthrone picramnioside F, and the oxanthrone mayoside C, were isolated from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis, along with the previously reported anthraquinones, 1-O-b-d- and 8-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin. The compounds were separated by recycling-HPLC, and their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. CD measurements were used to establish the absolute con®guration of the anthrone and oxanthrone. The antifungal activity of 1- O-b-d- and 8-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus was shown to be similar to that of the lignan sesamin. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) we reported the isolation and characterization of two C- glycosylated anthrones (picramniosides D, E), and two C-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B), as well as emodin and umbelliferone, from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis Tul., a tree found in Central America. Further investigations aorded, in minor quantities, two new C,O-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picramnioside F (1), and an oxathrone, mayoside C (2), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (3) and 8-O-b-d-gluco- pyranosyl emodin (4). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of com- pounds 1 and 2, and the antifungal activity of the iso- lated compounds. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract from the bark of P. teapensis aorded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds 1± 4, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shi- madzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones 3 and 4 were identi®ed on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992). Compound 1 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 671 ([M+1]+), 693 ([M+Na]+) and 709 ([M+K]+), with the base peak at m/z 509 ([M+1- C6H10O5]+). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. 0031-9422/00/$ - see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

E-mail address: djbf@power.ufscar.br (J.B. Fernandes). All of the spectroscopic characteristics of 1 were coincident with those of anthrones which we have pre- viously reported (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at lmax 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cmÿ1), ester carbonyl (1735 cmÿ1) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cmÿ1) groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at 7.4±7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of meta-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at 3.40±3.95, indicating sugar moieties. The presence of 33 carbons was evident from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at 95.8 and 105.4. Signals in the region of 62±81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D±E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agree- ment with lyxose (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on SolõÂs et al. (1995) which identi®ed the sugar of picramniosides A±C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-O were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments con®rmed only one CH2 signal at 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit. Complete assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experi- ments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In parti- cular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) 3J coupling between the ester carbonyl ( 164.7) and H-10, H-200 and H-600, indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-10 of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) 3J coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-50 ( 81.4), con- ®rming the position of the aglycone at C-50 of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a 3J correlation of the anomeric 838 T. RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al. / Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 837±841 proton of the glucose unit (H-1, 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the O-glucose unit at C-8. The magnitude of the coupling constant between H-50 and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an eq±eq conformation for these protons. The con®guration of the lyxose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (SolõÂs et al., 1995; HernaÂ ndez- Medel et al., 1998; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-10 and H-20 (J=0 Hz) suggesting an eq±eq conformation for these protons. Likewise, the J value of H-5000 (12 Hz) indicated an ax±ax conformation for H-5000 and H-4000 in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety. Further observations helped to establish the con®gura- tion at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of 1 (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picramnioside E (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the fol- lowing expected dierences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to O-glucosylation at C-8. Compound 2 was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of 2 gave pseudo-mole- cular ions at m/z 709 ([M+Na]+) and 725 ([M+K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]ÿ), which was consistent with the molecular for- mula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS±MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (m/z 563), lyxose (m/z 432), CH2OH (m/z 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corre- sponding to emodin (269). As observed previously for the mayosides (HernaÂ n- dez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed the same pattern described for 1, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of 2 had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). O-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound 2 at ring A. Assignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with pub- lished data (RodrõÂguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not aord all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1000 with C-1 ( 162) helped to con®rm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1000. Circular dichroism con®rmed the absolute con®guration at C-10 of 1 and 2 as S and R, respectively.

The compounds mayoside B, picramnioside E, 3, 4, emodin and umbelliferone were tested in the growth inhibition assay of Leucoagaricus gongilophorus, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. (1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds 3 and 4 presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in Sesamum indicum. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material. 3.

Plant material The bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San JoseÂ de la MontanÄ a, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica. 3.3. Isolation of constituents Dried and powdered bark of P. teapensis (615 g) was macerated with EtOH±H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was ®ltered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then n-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml minÿ1 UV detector at 254 nm), to aord compound 1 (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-O-b- (3) and 8-O-b-glucopy- ranosyl emodin (4). Further puri®cation of 3 (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and 4 (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described). Fraction 11 was submitted to HPLC separation under the same conditions (6.5 ml minÿ1, 7 cycles) to aord pure com- pound 2 (1.2 mg, 0.0004% w/w). 3.4.

Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of Piper arboreum yielded two new amides, N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) together with the known compounds N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E), 9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4). Catalytic hydrogenation of 3 yielded the amide N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5). We also have isolated six amides (6–11) and two antifungal cinnamoyl derivatives (12, 13) from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum. Compounds 1–11 showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against Cladosporium sphaerospermum while compounds 3-4 and 6–13 also showed antifungal activity against C. cladosporioides. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Keywords: Piper arboreum; Piper tuberculatum; Piperaceae; Amides; Antifungal activity 1. Introduction Chemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, lig- noids and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996; Parmar et al, 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadie- noyl]pyrrolidine, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl- 8-(30,40-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Ale´ cio et al., 1998) and 8(Z)-N- (12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one from Piper tuberculatum Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)- pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) and nine (3–11) known antifungal amides N-[10- (13,14-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3), its deri- vative N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)- 7(E),9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4); besides pellitorine (6), abdihydropiperine (7), piplartine (8), dihydro- piplartine (9), cis-piplartine (or 8(Z)-N-(12,13, 14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-3-pyridin-2-one) (10) and fagaramide (11). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxy- dihydrocinnamate (12) and methyl trans-6,7,8-trimethox- ycinnamate (13). The amides isolated from leaves of Piper arboreum (1–4) and the hydrogenated derivative of 3 (5) were active against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum 3, 4 and 6–13 0031-9422/02/$ - see front matter # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results and discussion N-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pen- tadienoil]-pyrrolidine (1) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electro- spray mass spectrum (ES–MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.93 (2H, s), and four oleﬁnic protons which showed signals at 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7=14.3 and J8,9=10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8=10.9 and J9,10=11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9= 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the E and Z geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the E and Z conﬁgurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of trans-trans conﬁguration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assign- ment of the cis conﬁguration for the g, double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at 3.52 (2H, m) and 1.90 (2H, m) attrib- uted to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of 1 were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-ﬁeld region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 164.8, 10 sp2 car- bons, four sp3 carbons [C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Arau´ jo-Junior et al., 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). Arboreumine (2) was shown to have the molecular formula C25H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES–MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respec- tively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at 2.15 (2H, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H- 20a and H-2b, H-20b which are characteristic of methyl- ene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-90, at 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at 1.20 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-110; H-13, H-120; H-14, H-130 and H-11, H-100, respectively. The signal at 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as conﬁrmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-50; H-8, H-70 and H-9, H-80 showed signals at 5.81 (q, J6,1250,110= 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (dd, J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1,0 Hz) and 5.76 (dd, J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further conﬁrmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-70; H-9, H- 80 and H-10, H-90 was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at 5.76 assigned to H- 9, H-80 (J9,880,70=15.5 Hz and J9,1080,90=5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-70 (J8,970,80=15.5 Hz and J8,1270,110=1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-90 (J10,990,80=5.0 Hz and J10,1190,100=6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 assigned to H-11, H- 100 (J11,10100,90=6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-20a (J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at 2.37 assigned to H- 2b, H-20b (J2b,2a20b,20a=17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spec- tral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum. The carbon signals at 49.5 and 40.9 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 1 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 1 1H [m, J (Hz), 200 MHz] 13C (50 MHz) 2 3.52 (2H, m) 45.8 3 1.90 (2H, m) 26.0 4 1.90 (2H, m) 24.2 5 3.52 (2H, m) 46.5 6 – 164.8 7 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3) 121.1 8 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7 and 8,9=14.3, 10.9) 144.4 9 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8 and 9,10=10.9, 11.4) 121.0 10 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9=11.4) 134.9 11 – 127.0 12 6.78 (1H, d, J12,16=1.7) 108.1 13 – 145.6 14 – 147.5 15 6.75 (1H, d, J15,16=8.1) 108.7 16 6.82 (1H, dd, J16,15 and 16,12=8.1, 1.7) 122.1 OCH2O 5.93 (2H, s) 100.7 R. Vasques da Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 59 (2002) 521–527 523 assigned to C-2, C-20 and C-3, C-30, respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the car- bon (C-3 and C-30), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at 198.3 and the 3H singlet at 0.95 (C- 14 and C-130) indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-20a and H-2b, H-20b ( 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 ( 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-120 and C-14, C-130 and H-14, H-130 and C-13, C-120 were also observed. The carbon signals at 163.9 (C-5, C-40), 126.1 (C-6, C-50) and 40.9 (C-3, C-30) showed a correla- tion with the 1H singlet at 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at 2.15 (H-2a, H-20a), corroborating the adjacent rela- tionship between the amide group and C-2, C-20. The carbon signals at 67.3 (C-10, C-90) and 135.6 (C-9, C- 80) showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-100 adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,- unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambigu- ously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 110 with the carbon signals 126.1 (C-6, C- 50) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70), whereas the quadruplet at 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-50 (J6,1250,110=1,0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70). Finally, HET- COR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide 2 was determined as depicted. The CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of P. tuberculatum were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C6H14 con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to aﬀord compounds 6–13. Pellitorine (6) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further puriﬁcation, and it was identiﬁed by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data pre- viously described by Rosario et al., 1996. a,bdihydro piperine (7) and dihydropiplartine (9) had their 1H NMR spectra published for the same compounds pre- viously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and Piper guineense (Parmar et al., 1997) and their 13C NMR spectral data recently pub- lished (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (8) was iso- lated from seeds and leaves, and the 1H and 13C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). Cis-piplartine (10) had its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (11) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl trans-6,7,8-tri- methoxycinnamate (13) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectro- scopic data were similar to that obtained in this work. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–13 was deter- mined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of com- pounds 1–13 (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered. The minimum amount of compounds 3–4; 2 and 5; and 1 required to inhibit growth of the fungus C. sphaero- spermum on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the stan- dards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against C. cladosporioides, the amide 4 being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds 6–10, 13 and 11, 12 the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus C. clados- porioides on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for 6–10 and 13 indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from P. arboreum are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the Table 2 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 2 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 2 1H [m, J (Hz), 500 MHz] 13C a (125 MHz) 1, 10 2.80 (1H, s) – 2a, 20a 2.15 (1H, d, J2a,2b20a,20b=17.0) 49.5 (t) 2b, 20b 2.37 (1H, d, J 2b,2a20b,20a=17.0) 3, 30 – 40.9 (s) 4 – 198.3 (s) 5, 40 – 163.9 (s) 6, 50 5.81 (1H, q, J6,1250,110=1.0) 126.1 (d) 7, 60 – b 8, 70 5.70 (1H, dd, J8,970,80 and 8,1270,110=15.5, 1.0) 128.6 (d) 9, 80 5.76 (1H, dd, J9,880,70 and 9,1080,90=15.5, 5.0) 135.6 (d) 10, 90 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,990,80 and 10,1190,100=5.0, 6.5) 67.3 (d) 11, 100 1.20 (3H, d, J 11,10100,90=6.5) 23.4 (q) 12, 110 1.83 (3H, s) 19.0 (q) 13, 120 1.00 (3H, s) 22.7 (q) 14, 130 0.95 (3H, s) 23.8 (q) a Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment. b This signal was not observed in the 13C NMR spectrum. 524 R. Vasques da Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 59 (2002) 521–527 piperidine, dihydropyridone and isobutyl amides from P. tuberculatum. It is important to note that the inhibi- tion of C. sphaerospermum by dihydropyridone amide 9 appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of C. cladosporioides was lower than the standards (Table 4). 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck 230–400 mesh) was used for all col- umn chromatography unless otherwise stated and sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spec- trometer. ES–MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), ﬂow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were per- formed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser. 3.2. Plant material Piper arboreum H. B. K. leaves were collected in Araraquara—SP, Brazil and identiﬁed by Dr. Guil- lermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Bio- cie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. Piper tuberculatum Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA—Manaus, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher speci- mens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biocie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. 3.3. Antifungal assays The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C. cladospor- ioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Bota.nica, Sa˜ o Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay—10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds 1–5 and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds 6–13, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in dark- ness in a moistened chamber at 25 C. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of 1–5 and 6–13 required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chlor- amphenicol were used as negative controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents A CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of P. arboreum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides 1–4. The dried and powdered leaves of P. arboreum (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The result- ing EtOH extract was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively.

Fraction 19 (1.7 g) was applied to a C18 HPLC column (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). After that the fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2: (CH3)2CO (92:02) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 1 (28.0 mg) and 3 (31.0 mg). Fraction 21 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 col- umn (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC eluted with CH2Cl2:(CH3)2CO:MeOH (92:0.5:0.5) and HOAc (1%) to give 2 (8.0 mg). Fraction 23 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 column (2.0 g) and eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2:C6H14: (CH3)2CO (6:3:1) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 3 (83.0 mg) and 4 (30.0 mg). The dried and powdered seeds and leaves of P. tuber- culatum (24.3 g) were extracted 2 with 600 ml of CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1), during 2 days (each extraction), at room temperature. The resulting extract of seeds was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 8 (33.0 mg) and 10 (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yiel- ded 9 (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds 6 (0.2 g) and 7 (18.0 mg), respec- tively, without any further puriﬁcation. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26–62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier. Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide 8 (0.9 g), without further puriﬁcation. Amide 11 (7.0 mg) was isolated from fraction 55 (0.2 g), which was further puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O(4:1)]. Fraction 28 (0.4 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), two elutions] yielding the cinnamoyl derivative 12 (66.0 mg) and fraction 67–68 (0.4 g) was puriﬁed by two prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1), two elutions and C6H14: EtOAc (7:3), one elution], respectively, to yield the cin- namoyl derivative 13 (13.0 mg). 3.5.

A literature analysis pointed out its importance as a source of prenylated bioactive molecules. The screening performed on aromatic acceptors (benzoic acids, phenols and phenylpropanoids) including geranyl diphosphate as prenyl donor, showed the biotransfor- mation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid by the crude extract, and the p-hydroxybenzoic acid by both the microsomal fraction and the crude extract, after treating leaves with glucose. The analysis of the products allowed the identiﬁcation of C- and O-geranylated derivatives, and the protease (subtilisin and pepsin) inhibition performed on the O-geranylated compounds showed weak inhibition. Electrophoretic proﬁles indicated the presence of bands/spots among 56–58 kDa and pI 6–7, which are compatible with pren- yltransferases. These ﬁndings show that P. crassinervium could be considered as a source of extracts with geranyltransferase activity to perform biotransformations on aromatic substrates. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

They are different from biosynthesis, where complex products are assembled from simple substrates by whole cells, organs or organisms. Plant enzyme biocatalysts can be uti- lized to introduce new structural motifs on existing drugs expect- ing to improve their bioactivity, pharmacokinetic proﬁle and also for the production of new drugs (Giri et al., 2001). So far, natural products bearing one or more prenyl groups have been isolated predominantly from higher plants. These com- pounds, originated from several natural product classes, often hold antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, antiviral, and anti- cancer activities (Epifano et al., 2008). Since the prenylation of small aromatic molecules is a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of many natural products, the access to prenylation reaction catalysts might represent an advantageous short-cut to obtain prenylated aromatic compounds (Yazaki et al., 2001; Haagena et al., 2007). Aromatic geranyltransferases are a sub-class of prenyltransfe- rases that catalyzes C-geranylations on several aromatic sub- strates. Several examples of new aromatic prenyltransferases have been reported from bacteria as soluble monomeric biocata- lysts, with a relatively high promiscuity for aromatic substrates. In spite of the lack of a full elucidation of substrate- and regio- speciﬁcity, these enzymes were successfully employed to carry out either C- or O-prenylations of several compounds (Epifano et al., 2008). In plants, aromatic geranyltransferases are mem- brane-bound proteins, showing a strict substrate speciﬁcity for the endogenous prenyl donor groups (e.g. DMAPP, GPP, etc.), although they may accept a variety of aromatic compounds as acceptors of the prenyl moieties (Yazaki et al., 2001; Kuzuyama et al., 2005). There are few examples in which prenyltransferases have been isolated and characterized from plants (Mühlenweg et al., 1998). Therefore, biotransformations using plant enzymatic extracts enriched in prenyltransferase activity could be used as an alternative to obtain either known or new bioactive compounds. Piperaceae family is a basal angiosperm family, comprising more than 4000 species. Its species are chemically very rich and major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Parmar et al., 1997; Bene- vides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003; Felippe et al., 2008), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alécio et al., 1998; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005).

Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Bioresource Technology journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/biortech family, Piper is one of the most abundant genera, with approxi- mately 2000 species (Wanke et al., 2007). Piper crassinervium spe- cies accumulates antifungal, trypanocidal and antioxidant C- geranylated metabolites derived from both benzoic acid and p- hydroquinone (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008). In spite of the knowledge on the chemical constituents and the biological potential of Piperaceae species, no comprehensive study has been made in order to survey such bioactive metabolites with- in the members of the family. Here we present a compilation that points out to the impor- tance of Piper genus as a source of bioactive compounds and, par- ticularly, of P. crassinervium as an enzyme source to perform geranylations on aromatic substrates. We report the biotransfor- mation (i.e. the geranylation) of both the p-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids carried out by the enzymatic extracts from the leaves of P. crassinervium besides the full characterization of two products as geranyl ester derivatives in addition to the char- acterization of one major product formed by biotransformation of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a C-geranylated derivative. Addi- tionally, the inhibitory activity on HIV-like proteases was determined for the products as well as the electrophoretic charac- terization of catalytically active protein fractions by using SDS PAGE and 2-DE. 2. Methods 2.1. Literature survey and analysis ‘Piperaceae’ and ‘activity’ were used as key words to perform a search in the available databases (e.g. Science Direct and ACS dat- abases). All the obtained information was uploaded in a table according to genus, species, type of compound and biological activ- ity reported (see the Electronic Annex in the online version of this article). Typical software Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation) was used to analyse and plot the obtained information. 2.2. Plant material Fresh leaves of P. crassinervium were collected from adults spec- imens cultivated from seeds under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara, SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo-Peru) and the voucher specimen (Kato-0084) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Incubation into b-D-glucose of young leaves from P. crassiner- vium. Leaves freshly excised from an adult plant were placed sep- arately in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and each administrated 100 ll from a 10% solution of b-D-glucose in water at 25 C for 72 h (Berg- amo et al., 2005). 2.3. Synthesis and puriﬁcation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) In a 100 ml round bottom ﬂask 1 mmol of geraniol was mixed with 6 mmol of trichloroacetonitrile. Bis-triethylammonium phos- phate (2.4 mmol in 20 ml of acetonitrile) was added drop-wise to the mixture over a period of 6 h, at room temperature under con- tinuous stirring (Cornforth and Popják, 1969). The mixture was fur- ther stirred for 12 h at room temperature and then, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 100 ml of ethyl ether, followed by extraction with 30 ml of NH4OH 0.1 M (3). The basic solution was then re-extracted with 30 ml of ethyl ether (3) and evapo- rated under reduced pressure. The GPP was puriﬁed by precipita- tion in acetonitrile at 20 C overnight, compared with a commercial sample using TLC on cellulose (isopropanol/25% aque- ous ammonia/water 50:25:25) and characterized by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR. 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): d 4.44 (H-1, d, J = 7.0 Hz), 5.41 (H-2, t, J = 7.0 Hz), 2.02–2.15 (H-4 and H-5, m), 5.17 (H-6, m), 1.59 (–CH3 8, s), 1.65 (–CH3 9, s), 1.66 (–CH3 10, s). 13C NMR (125 MHz, D2O): d 63.0 (C-1), 124.3 (C-2), 143.0 (C-3), 46.9 (C-4), 25.8 (C-5), 120.0 (C- 6), 133.9 (C-7), 25.0 (C-8), 17.2 (C-9) and 15.8 (C-10). 31P NMR (H3PO4, 202 MHz, D2O): d 9.75 (P-1), 10.40 (P-2). 2.4. Synthesis, puriﬁcation and characterization of the O-geranyl derivatives of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid To a stirred solution of the 3,4-dihydroxibenzoic acid (2 mmol) in dry DMF (10 ml), anhydrous potassium carbonate (6 mmol) was added and the solution stirred for 30 min at 40 C under nitrogen atmosphere (Pisco et al., 2006). Geranyl bromide (4 mmol) was added drop-wise and the resulting mixture was heated and stirred at the same temperature for 8 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then poured into cold water (50 ml) added with 0.1% of HOAc, and extracted with CHCl3 (100 ml) and EtOAc (100 ml). The EtOAc layer was washed, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was submitted to column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230–400 mesh), iso- cratic elution with Hex–EtOAc (60:40)] yielding ﬁve fractions. Fraction 2 was characterized as compound 3, fraction 4 as com- pound 4 and fraction 5 as compound 5. The puriﬁed products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Fig. 4, Table 1). 2.5. Synthesis, puriﬁcation and characterization of the O-geranyl derivatives of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid The p-hydroxybenzoic acid (1 mmol) dissolved in 5 ml of THF was added to a slurry of 5 g of Al2O3 neutral in ether (1 ml) (Glü- senkamp and Büchi, 1986). The solvent was evaporated and gera- nyl bromide (3 mmol) in ether–hexane (30:70) was added. After stirring during 4 days, Al2O3 was ﬁltered off and washed with 1% HOAc in EtOAc. The combined organic layer was evaporated and the products were puriﬁed using column chromatography [Silica- gel 60 (230–400 mesh), gradient elution with Hex 100%, Hex– EtOAc (90:10; 80:20; 50:50)], yielding 7 fractions. From fraction 3 it was characterized the geranyl ester derivative (6), whereas the geranyl ether derivative (7) was puriﬁed from fraction 4 by subsequent column chromatography [Silica-gel 60 (230–400 mesh), isocratic elution with Hex–EtOAc (80:20)]. The puriﬁed products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DEPT, gHMBC, gHMQC and ESI-MS (Table 2, Fig. 5). 2.6. Protein extraction Leaves of P. crassinervium were harvested from an adult speci- men and maintained in liquid N2. The frozen leaves (10 g) were triturated in a mortar with addition of 35% polyvinylpolypyrroli- done (PVPP), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM ethylenedi- aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 30 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 8). The homogenate was stirred slowly by 15 min in ice bath, ﬁltered on gauze and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant (crude enzymatic extract), which was then submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis. 2.7. Microsomal fraction The protocol was performed according to Mühlenweg et al. (1998) with minimal modiﬁcations. The supernatant (20 ml) ob- tained as described in Section 2.6 was subjected to ultracentrifuga- 4252 S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 tion at 39,000 rpm for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 1 M KCl and 10% (w/v) glycerol, and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspen- sion was subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. The supernatant was discarded, and the tube was carefully rinsed with 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5). The pellet was then resuspended in 10 ml of 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 6.5), containing 2 mM DTT, 2 M KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 4 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammo- nium]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPSO), and stirred on ice for 30 min. The suspension was ultracentrifuged as described above, and the desired proteins were recovered as supernatant, which was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (9.0 cm long, 1.0 cm i.d.), previously equilibrated with the 0.05 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1.5 mM CHAPSO, 2 mM DTT and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The eluate was submitted to protein determination, activity assay and electrophoretic analysis. 2.8. Protein determination The protein determination was performed by the Bradford modiﬁed method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard (Stoscheck, 1990). 2.9. Detection of the geranyltransferase activity The reaction mixture (100 ll) containing 100 mM KPi (pH 8.0), 10 mM of precursors, 10 mM GPP, 10 mM MgCl2 (or MnCl2) and 65 ll of the proteic extract was incubated under stirring for 60 min at 35 C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 5 ll of 6 M HCl and extracted with 150 ll of EtOAc. After vortex and centrifugation, the organic layer was evaporated, the residue dissolved in MeOH (100 ll) and analysed by HPLC–UV, using a Phenomenex GEMINI column (5 lm C18 110 Å, 250 4.6 mm) at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic condition (25 min) con- sisted of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous HOAc (30%), with detection at 254 and 280 nm. Injection volume: 50 ll. For each reaction, two negative controls, which consisted of: (1) enzymatic extract + buffer and (2) precursor + divalent cation + GPP + buffer, were carried out simultaneously. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. 2.10. Sodium dodecylsulphate–polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS– PAGE) The SDS PAGE was performed according to the supplier infor- mation (GE Healthcare). The 12% polyacrylamide gels were stained with AgNO3. The relative molecular mass (Mr) of denatured proteins was estimated using the LabImage 1D software cali- brated with low molecular weight standards (phosphorylase b, sericalbumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase and trypsin inhibi- tor, with 97.4, 66.2, 45.0, 31.0, 21.5 and 14.4 kDa, respectively). 2.11. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) The 2-DE with immobilized pH gradients (IPG-Dalt) was carried out according to the supplier information (GE Healthcare). The IPG strips (13 cm) were rehydrated for 14–18 h with sample pro- teins previously treated with the Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare) Table 1 1H NMR data (500 MHz, J = Hz, CDCl3), 13C NMR data (125 MHz, CDCl3) and gHMBC correlations observed for compounds 3–5.

S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 4253 in an Immobiline DryStrip Reswelling Tray. First dimension iso- electric focusing (IEF) was carried out in an Ettan IPGphor II Man- ifold applying a manufacturer’s standard protocol. The second dimension was performed on a vertical (14 16 cm) 12% poly- acrylamide SDS gel, in a SE 600 Ruby System, 45 mA/gel and 600 V. Each gel was stained with silver according to the Silver Staining Protocol (Amersham Biosciences). 2.12. Inhibition of the protease activity 2.12.1. Reagents Pepsin was from porcine gastric mucous. Recombinant Type VIII Subtilisin Carlsberg, Arg-Glu-(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile- Val-Gln-Lys-(DABCYL)-Arg ﬂuorogenic substrate (EDANS-DABCYL) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) spectrophotometric grade, were from Sigma–Aldrich, São Paulo, Brazil. 2.12.2. Protease activity assay The assays were performed in triplicate. Compounds were dis- solved in DMSO and diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) for subtilisin and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.4) for pepsin, respec- tively. Warfarin and dicoumarol were used as positive controls (Thaisrivongs et al., 1994; Pochet et al., 2000). Samples and stan- dard inhibitors (1 lg/ml) were pre-incubated with subtilisin (37 nM) or pepsin (1.7 nM) for 1 h, and then transferred to a black opaque microplate to be tested. The substrate EDANS-DABCYL (2 lM) was prepared in the speciﬁc buffer for each protease. In the control assay only protease and substrate were used. Proteases were prepared in the day of the experiment and the tests were per- formed for each one separately. Readings were made using 360 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission) ﬁlters during 7 min, with 1 min intervals, at 37 C (Hirata et al., 2005). The ﬂuorescence intensity was used to calculate the % of inhibition as follows: %I ¼ 100 ½ðDFs=DFpÞ 100 where, DFs and DFp are the difference between the ﬁrst and last readings for the sample test and the control, respectively. Fluorescence bioassay data were collected with a multidetec- tion microplate reader Synergy™HT and analysed using the KC4 software (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) and Microsoft Windows XP. 3. Results and discussion Prenylation is a chemical or enzymatic addition of a hydropho- bic side chain to an accepting molecule (another terpenoid mole- cule, an aromatic compound, a protein, etc.). In particular, the prenylation of aromatic secondary metabolites plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of a wide range of molecules exerting valuable pharmacological effects. Several examples can be found in phylo- genetically different classes of living organisms, from bacteria across mammals to plants (Epifano et al., 2008). Phytochemical investigations carried out on Piper species have led to the isolation of many bioactive natural products. The analy- sis of the distribution of these bioactive compounds (by genus, type of compound and bioactivity) in the Piperaceae family was performed looking at, particularly, the importance of prenylated natural products within that universe. The search was performed using ‘Piperaceae’ and ‘activity’, as key words, in the available web databases. This search resulted in 656 entries (see the Elec- tronic Annex in the online version of this article), which were ana- lysed and discussed here. The analysis was performed considering the botanical classiﬁcation as provided in the publications. Regarding the distribution of bioactive compounds reported within genera, a predominance of Piper genus over Peperomia genus was observed, representing 83%. In spite of the large number of species belonging to Peperomia genus (about 1700 species ver- sus 2000 from Piper) (Wanke et al., 2007), it only contributes with 15% of the total reports published. Such differences can be ac- counted for the fact that Piper species have been more exhaustively Table 2 1H NMR data (500 MHz, J = Hz, CDCl3) for compounds 6 and 7. 13C NMR data (125 MHz, CDCl3) and gHMBC correlations for compound 6.

(for details see the Electronic Annex). 4254 S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 studied partially due to their wide occurrence and biomass avail- ability (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex). Among Piper genus, 44 species were subjected to phytochemical or bioactivity investigations, being P. cubeba the most intensively studied with near 8%, followed by P. longum and P. aduncum with 7%, P. methysticum and P. tuberculatum with 6%, P. sanctum, P. ni- grum and P. crassinervium with 5% (Fig. 1). Only nine studies with Peperomia species were found, with P. duclouxii (28%), P. dindygul- ensis (18%) and P. galioides (13%), being the three mentioned most frequently. Considering the type of compounds, they were grouped based on their structural characteristics, as follows: ALK (alkaloids and other substances bearing nitrogen), LG (lignans, neolignans and re- lated compounds), PCT (polyketides), TP (terpenoids), BPPR (preny- lated benzopyrans), HQPR (prenylated hydroquinones), BPR (prenylated benzoic acid derivatives), FLV (ﬂavonoids, chalcones and related compounds), B (benzene derivatives), BP (benzopyr- anes), AG (fatty acids), FP (phenylpropanoids), E (epoxides), ET (steroids), CHX (cyclohexanic derivatives), KLN (kavalactones, pyr- ones, and related compounds) and NPT (naphthalene derivatives), (Fig. 2A). Their distribution shows the prevalence of nitrogenated substances (ALK), lignoids (LG) and ﬂavonoids (FLV) in Piper spe- cies. Nevertheless some differences could be observed in Pepero- mia, where LG (lignoids) and BPPR (prenylated benzopyrans) were the most abundant (Fig. 2A). Regarding biological activities, the grouping was performed considering the biological target in order to simplify as follows: snc (involving activities related to central nervous system, such as sedative and relaxant), tryp (antiprotozoal activity against Try- panosoma, Plasmodium, Leishmania), cyt (cytotoxicity and related activities), atb (antimicrobial, such as antibacterial and antifungal), can (anticancer activity, related to cytotoxic but more speciﬁcally targeted), insec (insecticidal or repellent activity, such as anti- mosquito or ant), aox (antioxidant activity, such as DPPH), enz (inhibiroty activity against several enzymes), aai (anti-inﬂamma- tory activity), acoag (anticoagulant, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation), iger (allelophatic activity), photo (photo-protecting activity), cic (cicatrizing activity) and avir (antiviral activity). The obtained distribution shows that Piper genus is mostly related to antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities, followed by anti-inﬂam- matory and enzymatic inhibitory activities, while Peperomia ap- pears to be mostly related to cytotoxic and antiprotozoal activities. Only Pothomorphe genus showed some relationship with antiviral activity (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2. (A) Distribution by type of bioactive compounds reported by genera in Piperaceae family.

S.N. López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 4255 About prenylated natural products, i.e., all the compounds bear- ing one or more prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moie- ties as substituents in their basic structures, open or cycled (BP, BPR, BPPR and HQPR), they could be found in Peperomia, Pothomor- phe and in Piper species (Fig. 2). In addition, they are mostly related to antimicrobial (atb), insecticidal (insec) and antioxidant activity (aox), being the prenylated benzoic acid derivatives (BPR) from Pi- per species, the group with the most biological activities reported (Fig. 3). The analysis for the occurrence of major secondary compounds pointed out that Piper species could be considered as an important source of prenylated compounds and thus a source for further studies of prenyltransferase activity. The two species P. crassinervi- um and P. aduncum accounted for 11% of the total number of spe- cies in which bioactive substances have been reported for this genus and can be considered good candidates for further investiga- tion on bioactive prenylated metabolites (Fig. 1, Electronic Annex). Considering the literature survey performed here as well as our previous experience on both bioactivity and biosynthetic studies of prenylated compounds from some Piper species, P. crassinervium was selected for further studies (Lopes et al., 2008). This species accumulates two C-geranylated metabolites derived from benzoic acid [4-hydroxy-3-E-(30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20,60-octadienyl)ben- zoic acid (1)] and from 1,4–benzenediol [(1,4-dihydroxy-2-E- (30,70-dimethyl-10-oxo-20,60-octadienyl)benzene (2)], which showed antifungal, antioxidant and trypanocidal activities (Fig. 1) (Danelutte et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 2008). A screening for the prenylation activity with the crude enzy- matic extract from fresh leaves of P. crassinervium plus geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as the prenyl donor, a divalent cation (MgCl2 or MnCl2) and several aromatic substrates (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phenol, p- hydroquinone, caffeic acid, o- and p-coumaric acids) was initially performed. Neither the p-hydroxybenzoic acid nor the p-hydroqui- none (the two theoretically natural precursors of compounds 1 and 2) was biotransformed, whilst the reaction with the 3,4-dihydroxy- benzoic acid led to the formation of products, as observed in the chromatographic proﬁle, suggesting a biotransformation reaction when compared with that of the negative control. The reaction was consistently reproducible and the product was analysed by HPLC–UV–MS showing an intense peak at tR: 13.1 min with kmax at 280 nm besides some minor compounds between tR: 7–9 min (Fig. 4). The fact that the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid could be bio- transformed is interesting because no prenylated natural products bearing a catechol moiety have been isolated from P. crassinervium previously. The characterization of the biotransformation products was performed by the analysis of their UV–Vis and MS or tandem MS–MS (ESI negative mode) spectra, as well as by comparison with synthetic compounds prepared for this purpose: the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid geranyl ester (compound 3), the 4-O-geranyl- 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound 4) and the 3-O-geranyl-4- hydroxybenzoic acid (compound 5) (Table 1). Regarding the minor products detected (chromatographic peaks detected at 254 nm with tR between 7 and 9 min), their mass (MS) spectra were investigated and compared to those of the synthetic compounds 3–5. This analysis and the comparison of the chro- matographic proﬁles, UV (Amax 258 and 295 nm) and MS spectra ([MH] = 289, [MC10H17] = 153 and [MC10H17CO2] = 109) with those of the negative controls (see Section 2.9) allowed the determination of the product eluted at tR: 8.6 min as the geranyl ester of the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3) (Fig. 4). The compound eluted at tR: 13.1 min displayed a [MH] = 303, which under subsequent fragmentation by MS–MS, gave rise to the fragment ion m/z = 259, indicating the loss of a CO2 molecule (Fig. 4). Considering that the addition of one geranyl moiety to this aromatic core produces a molecule with MW = 290, an additional oxidation at the geranylic chain was suggested on the basis of the MW = 304 observed, compatible with additional 14 unities to the MW = 290. This suggestion was based on the observation of the oxidation pattern of the isolated metabolites 1 and 2, which have a carbonyl carbon at their geranyl moieties (Fig. 1). The posi- tion of the geranyl moiety could be proposed as a C- (at the aro- matic ring) instead of an O-substitution (at a phenol group), due to the lack of the fragment at m/z = 153 in the MS–MS spectrum (Fig. 4). The position of the oxidation at the geranyl moiety was as- sumed to be at C-50, due to the observation of the fragment ions at m/z = 203 and 159, which could result from a McLafferty-type rear- rangement (Fig. 4) (Grossert et al., 2006). Since plant prenyltransferases are mostly membrane-associated enzymes, an additional protocol on the crude extract was per- formed to obtain a microsomal fraction (Mühlenweg et al., 1998). The process was monitored by electrophoresis SDS PAGE and 2- DE, and the microsomal fraction was evaluated for its geranyl- transferase activity having p-hydroquinone, p-hydroxybenzoic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids as aromatic acceptors. No prod- ucts were detected when p-hydroquinone and 3,4-dihydroxyben- zoic acid were used as substrates. Nevertheless, the analysis indicated that the p-hydroxybenzoic acid was biotransformed yielding a new product as a weak chromatographic peak (tR: 13.6 min), absent in the negative controls. The chromatographic proﬁle of the obtained product was compared with those of the endogenous (1) and synthetic (6 and 7, Table 2) compounds, sug- gesting that the product of this biotransformation could be an O- geranylated derivative (Fig. 5). Previous studies carried out by our research group with leaves of P. crassinervium have demonstrated that compounds 1 and 2 were biosynthesized de novo after incubation for three days with glucose (unpublished results). Consequently, a protocol of feeding glucose by pre-incubation of fresh leaves from P. crassinervium with a 10% aqueous solution was applied to enhance the expres- sion of the geranyltransferase activity. Subsequent to the enzymatic reaction, the synthesis of the ex- pected product was enhanced, being possible to identify it as the geranylic ester of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid 6 both in the crude extract and in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 5).

(2007), we propose that it is the ester derivative instead of the ether, as reported. The expected chemical shift value for the CH2-10 at d observed in the 1H NMR, should be similar for the two derivatives 6 and 7 and, therefore this data should not be enough to distinguish which derivative was formed. Thus, further NMR experiments including analysis of the 13C NMR values and the gHMBC correlations were carried out. The observed differences in the substrate speciﬁcity, suggest the presence of, at least, two geranyltransferases in P. crassinervi- um. One of them was soluble and showed afﬁnity to the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid, while the second was concentrated in the microsomal fraction, recognizing the p-hydroxybenzoic acid as substrate and was inducible by glucose. The SDS PAGE and 2-DE analysis indicated the concentration of spots between pI 6–7 and 56–58 kDa in the microsomal fraction, which is in agreement with previous reports for geranyltransferases from plants (Fig. 6). The two enzymatically formed products were characterized as O-geranylated derivatives and were previously reported as syn- thetic compounds (Kubo et al., 2003). The production of esters in- stead of ethers or C-prenylated derivatives, as naturally occurs in plants, suggests that different conditions and environments could affect the prenylation outcome in crude and partly puriﬁed enzy- matic extracts. Besides, a C-geranylated derivative of the 3,4-dihy- droxybenzoic acid bearing a carbonyl group at C-50 could be proposed by the analysis of its MS–MS fragmentation data.

López et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 4251–4260 observations are in agreement with previous reports based on bac- terial recombinant aromatic prenyltransferases (Haagena et al., 2007). In spite of the large number of data on phytochemistry and bio- activity on Piper species, no studies have been addressed to deter- mine their antiviral potential and the only exception involved the monotypic Pothomorphe umbellata (Fig. 3). The inhibition of viral proteases has indeed been demonstrated to be a good target to search new drugs for the treatment of several illnesses including AIDS. In this context, the investigation on some common proteases such as subtilisin and pepsin is considered as a useful screening for the discovery of potential inhibitors of retroviral proteases (Hirata et al., 2005). Compounds 3 and 6 were tested as inhibitors of sub- tilisin and pepsin using the ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methodology. Both compounds showed weak activity, being the ester 6 slightly more active than 3 showing 15% of inhibition at 1 lg/ml on pepsin and 14% on subtilisin (Table 3). Warfarin and dicoumarol were tested as positive controls. The HIV-like protease inhibitory potential reported for 3 and 6 is the ﬁrst approach to the determination of antiviral activity of this kind of compounds, and complements the range of biological activities previously reported, such as antifungal and antibacterial (Kubo et al., 2003; Nihei et al., 2004). 4. Conclusions Prenylation of aromatic compounds represents an important feature when the formation of bioactive compounds in plants is concerned. There are several examples in which different simple prenyl, geranyl, farnesyl, geranylgeranyl or polyterpenic unities are added to aromatic substrates rendering them with important biological properties. The literature survey indicated that among Piperaceae family, P. crassinervium species appeared as an impor- tant source of geranyltransferase activity looking at biotransforma- tions reactions. Between the two substrates evaluated, the p- hydroxybenzoic acid was O-geranylated, whilst the 3,4-dihydroxy- benzoic acid was both C- and O-geranylated. The O-geranylated products presented a weak protease inhibitory activity. The elec- trophoretic analysis performed on the microsomal fraction showed a typical prenyltransferase electrophoretic proﬁle (Mr 56–58 kDa, pI 6–7). This work contributes to the comprehensive study of biotrans- formation reactions with geranyl moieties using plant enzymatic extracts as an alternative strategy to the biocatalysis with puriﬁed enzymes.

Introduction Endophytic fungi are organisms living within the tissues of hosts plants (Andrews and Hirano, 1991). These organ- isms are known as potential sources of biologically active secondary metabolites (Dreyfuss and Chapela, 1994; Tan and Zou, 2001; Strobel et al., 2004) and relatively little is known about the potential of these microorganisms from Brazilian endemic plant species (Azevedo et al., 2000, 2004). As part of our studies on bioactive agents from metabo- lites produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado, we initially selected 16 species of plants, which had already been phy- tochemically proﬁled by our group. Those species were submitted for isolation of endophytic fungi and 82 pure isolates were obtained, preserved, cultivated in liquid media and extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain crude extracts. Some metabolites produced by fungi were already published by our group (Teles et al., 2005; Cafeˆu et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005). The crude EtOAc extract of Phomopsis cassiae isolated from Cassia spectabilis showed moderate antifungal activ- ity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladospo- rium cladosporioides, stimulating further studies. Bioassay guided fractionation of this extract aﬀorded ﬁve new ses- quiterpenes (1–5). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular for- mula C15H22O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 273.1486). Their IR spectra revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm1) and phenolic groups (1466, 1690 cm1). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) showed two aromatic signals, one at d 6.87 (1H, s) and the other at d 6.43 (1H, s), sug- gesting a tetra-substituted aromatic spin-system with a para conﬁguration. A series of complex signals at d 3.76 (1H, m) 3.35 (4H, m); d 3.04 (1H, m) and d 2.30 (1H, m) were indicative of two carbinolic and two benzyl hydrogens, respectively. Further signals at d 0.51 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 1.03 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 2.05 (3H, s) revealed the presence of two aliphatic and one aromatic methyl groups in the molecule. The 13C NMR chemical shifts for 1 along with the infor- mation obtained from a DEPT-135 experiment (Table 1), indicated a total of 15 signals, suggesting a sesquiterpene: six aromatic carbons at d 152.9 (s), 141.1 (s), 128.1 (d), 127.4 (s), 121.9 (s) and 114.7 (d), conﬁrming the tetra-sub- stitution for the aromatic moiety and the para hydrogen system; two carbinolic signals: a methine at d 67.8 and a methylene at d 64.4; three signals for methines at d 40.1, 38.4 and 36.5; one aliphatic methylene at d 24.6 and three signals for methyl groups: d 16.7, 15.9 and 10.8. The above data suggested a cadinane skeleton (Zhang et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 1996). The total attribution for the observed signals was accomplished based on gHMQC correlations. Additional gHMBC correlations of H-5 (d 6.87) with C- 15 and C-7 (d 15.9 and d 36.5, respectively) and H-2 (d 6.43) with C-10 and C-4 (d 40.1 and d 121.9) allowed us to fully determine the aromatic moiety. The phenolic func- tion linked at C-3, was supported by the correlations between H-15 (d 2.05) and C-3/C-5 (d 152.9 and d 128.1, respectively). The linkage of the p-menthane moiety was determined through the correlations shown by C-1 (d 141.1) with H-14/H-9 (d 1.03/d 3.76) and C-6 (d 127.4) with, H-11/H-8b (d 2.70/d 1.52). Observed correlations between C-12 ! H-7 (d 64.4/3.04) and H-13 ! C-7 (d 0.51/36.5) allowed us to fully determine the calamenene skeleton (Nagashima et al., 1996). gNOESY was useful to establish the relative conﬁgura- tion of the stereocenters for 1. A correlations between Me-14 and Me-13 conﬁrmed a cis-calamenene, according to reported literature (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993). Further observed corre- lations between H-9a and H-7 allowed us to conﬁrm a (cis)-1,3-pseudo-diaxial relationship between these centers (Nabeta et al., 1993). We were not able to determine the conﬁguration of the stereocenter at C-11, due to free rotation of this center with C-7–C-11 bond. Compound 1 was thus identiﬁed as the rel. ()-(7S,9S,10S)-3,9,12- trihydroxycalamenene. Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H22O3 ([M + HH2O]+) at m/z 233.1542. The obtained mass and similarities observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) indicated that 2 was a diastereoisomer of 1. The main spectroscopic diﬀerences observed for this molecule were elucidated by using gNOESY. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 indicated that both groups remained in a cis conformation. The appearance of a strong correlation of Me-14 and H-9 indicated that H-7 and H-9 were in a trans conformation.

Assignments were aided by 1H–1H gCOSY and gHMQC. G.H. Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 1964–1969 1965 et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993) allowed us to provisionally deduce identify 2 as rel. (+)-(7S,9R,10S) the C-9 diastereo- isomer of 1. Compound 3 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. HRESI mass data allowed us to propose the molecular formula C15H22O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 235.1777). The absence of an oxygen atom in this molecule allowed us to provisionally deduce that a reduction occurred at position C-9. This reduction was conﬁrmed by 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) due to the presence of the signal at d 28.5 and the lack of the carboxymethine signal at d 67.8/69.1 present in 1 and 2, respectively. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 was observed in the gNOESY experiment thus concluding that 3 has a cis calamenene relative stereochemistry. Observed correla- tions between H-9a and H-8a and H-7 deﬁned their relative conﬁguration also as cis. Further observed correlations between H-8b and H-9b, conﬁrmed the relative conﬁgura- tion established for the p-menthane moiety. Compound 3 was hence identiﬁed as the rel. (+)-(7S,10S) 3,12- dihydroxycalamenene. Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. A molecular formula C15H18O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 231.1405) was obtained after HRESI mass data analysis. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed a new aromatic hydrogen spin system at d 7.03 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) and d 6.93 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) with an ortho conﬁguration. The downﬁeld shift observed for Me-14 (Dd +1.3) was indic- ative of an aromatization of the p-menthane moiety (Nab- eta et al., 1994). 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) data showed 10 aromatic carbons, three methyls: two benzylic and one aliphatic; one carboxymethylene and one benzylic methine, indicative of the presence of a naphthalene skele- ton. All correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and compared with reported data for cadalene analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Further correlations observed in the gHMBC experi- ment, particularly the ones of H-8 (d 6.93) with C-6/C-11 and H-9 (d 7.03) with C-1/C-14 allowed us to fully deter- mine the substitution pattern of the B ring for the naphtha- lene moiety. Compound 4 was identiﬁed as 3,12- dihydroxycadalene. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H18O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 269.1179). The appearance of a hydroxyl group in 5 was corroborated by the loss of the signal assigned to H-11 (d 3.59) in 4 thus suggesting that oxidation had occurred at this position. 13C NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopic data corroborated this assump- tion showing a signal at d 75.3 (s) which exhibited a corre- lation showed in the gHMBC experiment with H-8 (d 7.21) indicating that the new oxidized position was at C-11. Other correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, and compared with reported data for analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Compound 5 was identiﬁed as the new 3,11,12- trihydroxycadalene. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–5 against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaero- spermum was evaluated by bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). The compound 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (2) exhibited potent activity against two fungi. The detection limit for the compound 5 was found to be 1.0 lg, compara- ble with the same amount of the standard nystatin. Cytotoxicity of the compounds 1–5 against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983).

Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC50 5 lmol L1. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure Optical rotations were determined at room temperature using Perkin–Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin–Elmer 1710 spectrometer and Perkin–Elmer UV–Vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on Microquimica MQAPF-301. 1H and 13C NMR spectra; gHMBC and gHMQC, gCOSY and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive and nega- tive ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-reso- lution orthogonal time of ﬂight (o-TOF) conﬁguration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 ll/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH–H2O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using a ESI capil- lary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/ MS spectra of mass selected ions were acquired using 10– 20 eV collisions with argon. For preparative HPLC separa- tions, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, and a Phe- nyl-hexyl Luna Phenomenex column, (250 · 21.20 mm, 5 lm), were used in this study. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromato-integrator connected to a UV detector. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisal- dehyde 5% in H2SO4 followed by heating. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated C. spectabilis plant material was collected in the Chemistry Institute UNESP – Araraquara, SP, Bra- zil in June 17, 2001 by G.H. Silva. The botanical identiﬁca- tion was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SILVA – 193). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus The fungal strain P. cassiae was an endophyte isolated from leaves of C. spectabilis. The leaves were washed in running H2O and surface sterilized by successive soaking in NaOCl 1% for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 1 min and then rinsed twice with water. Aseptically the leaves were cut open and 1 · 1 cm2 pieces of the leaves were placed on water agar in Petri plates. After incubation at 25 C for seven days, individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maier et al., 1997). During the ﬁrst three weeks of incubation, the cultures were periodically checked for purity and successively subcultured by hyphal tipping method until pure culture was obtained. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar. The taxonomic iden- tiﬁcation as P. cassiae was performed based on fungal morphology by Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited Cole- c¸a˜o Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lav- ras fungal herbarium and assigned as CML 292. 3.4. Growth of P. cassiae and production of the EtOAc extract The fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlen- meyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 C for 15 min. Approxi- mately 10 small pieces (1 · 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the P. cassiae isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration. The culture broth was extracted with EtOAc (3 · 2,0 L). The EtOAc extracts were combined, ﬁltered, and evaporated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (277.12 mg). 3.5. Antifungal assay The microorganisms C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Com- pounds 1–5 were applied on a precoated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 lL) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 lg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control. 3.6. Cytotoxicity bioassays The human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described (Mosmann, 1983). Cisplatin was used as positive control (IC50 5.0 lmol L1). 3.7. Extraction and isolation The extract was subjected to C18 column chromatogra- phy employing gradient elution from H2O to MeOH, to yield 7 fractions (H2O:MeOH, 85:15, 65:35, 60:40, 55:45, 45:55, 35:65, 00:100 each 150 mL). 1H NMR spectro- scopic analyses identiﬁed fractions 3, 4 and 5 as promising G.H.

The MeOH extract of leaves of Iryanthera juruensis, one of the plants endemic to the Amazon region and consumed in Brazil, and the hexane extract from its seeds inhibited lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2)) enzymes in in vitro assays. Further analyses of these extracts yielded 5-deoxyflavones (1-5) from the leaf extract and sargachromenol (6), sargaquinoic acid (7), a novel juruenolic acid (8), ω-arylalkanoic acids (9a-c), and the lignan guaiacin (10) from the seed extract. Compounds 3-5 inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88% at 10 ppm, respectively, and compounds 6 and 9a-c showed inhibition at 76% and 78% at 100 ppm, respectively. However, compounds 7 and 8 were inactive and lignan 10 exhibited LPO inhibitory activity by 99% at 100 ppm compared to commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and vitamin E. The flavones 1-5 also inhibited COX-1 and -2 enzymes by 50-65% at 100 ppm. Compound 6 showed high but nonselective inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, when compared to aspirin and Celebrex, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Compounds 7 and 10 inhibited COX-1 by 60% and 65% and COX-2 by 37% and 18%, respectively, whereas compounds 8 and 9a-c showed little or no activity against these enzymes. KEYWORDS: Iryanthera juruensis; Myristicaceae; lipid peroxidation; cyclooxygenase; flavone; tocotrienol; ω-arylalkanoic acids; lignan INTRODUCTION Plants from Myristicaceae family have been traditionally used as food supplements by South American Indians. The anecdotal health benefits of these plants are implicated in healing stomach infections and wounds and for inducing central nervous system (CNS) alterations when used during religious ceremonies. The Iryanthera species are endemic to the Amazon region and their crushed leaves were reported to heal infected wounds and cuts. Also, the latex from the barks, mixed with warm water, was used for treating infections (1). The seeds of Iryanthera species are valued in Brazil for their high yield in fatty acids, which also explains their general designation as “ucu-uba”, or fat- producing tree. The protein-rich aril and roasted seeds as well as beverages prepared from the crushed leaves of Iryanthera are consumed by native people in the Amazon region. The major constituent in the seeds of Iryanthera species is myristic acid, a C14 fatty acid. It usually co-occurs with antioxidant toco- trienols and is extensively used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries (2). In the course of our systematic studies on Iryanthera species, we have demonstrated the presence of antioxidant tocotrienols, flavonoids, and flavonolignans in fruits and leaves of Iryanthera grandis, Iryanthera lancifolia, Iryan- thera sagotiana, and Iryanthera juruensis (3-7). Oxidative damage to the cell membrane and its components is the initial event in several human disease processes, including cancer and atherosclerosis. Iryanthera spp. are known for their health benefits and hence we have continued the search for natural antioxidants in this plant species. It is a popular notion that regular consumption of antioxidant compounds imparts beneficial effects to biological systems and that such compounds act as chemopreventive agents. It has been established that compounds with radical scavenging activity are beneficial to health since they induce detoxifying enzymes (8, 9). As part of ongoing projects aimed at the discovery of bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora [Biota-FAPESP (www.biotasp.org.br) and BIOprospecTA (www.bioprospecta.org. br)], the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of 56 plant extracts have been examined by means of in vitro assays measuring the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and * Corresponding author: fax +1-517-432-2310; e-mail nairm@msu.edu. † Sa˜o Paulo State University. ‡ Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals, Michigan State Uni- versity. § Center for Human Nutrition, University of California at Los Angeles.

The methanol and hexane extracts of I. juruensis leaves and seeds, respectively, were subjected to bioassay-directed chro- matographic purification. This paper presents the comparative LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities of the pure isolates and of crude extracts along with commercial antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and vitamin E, as well as clinically used antiinflam- matory agents aspirin and Celebrex. Also, this is the first report of flavones 1-5 from I. juruensis and of the novel juruenolic acid (8). MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedures. UV and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B and a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1750 spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR spectra [1H, 13C, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experi- ments] were measured on Varian INOVA (300 MHz) and VRX (500 MHz) instruments. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to residual proton signals of CDCl3 at 7.24 and DMSO-d6 at 2.50. Coupling constants, J, are in Hertz. 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to residual 13C signals of CDCl3 at 77.0 and DMSO-d6 at 39.5. Standard pulse sequences were employed for all 1D [1H, 13C, and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)] and 2D (COSY, HMBC, and HMQC) NMR experiments. Mass spectra were recorded at the Michigan State University mass spectrometry facility on a JEOL HX- 110 double-focusing mass spectrometer (Peabody, MA) operating in the positive ion mode for fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and high-resolution (HR) FABMS experiments. Merck silica gel (60 mesh size, 35-70 µm) with particle size of 60 µm was used for preparative medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). For preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation, 250, 500, and 1000 µm silica gel plates (Analtech, Inc., Newark, DE) were used. TLC plates were viewed under UV light at 254 and 366 nm or sprayed with 10% sulfuric acid solution. Solvents were of ACS reagent grade and were purchased from Spectrum Chemical Co. (Gardena, CA). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), R-tocopherol, dimethyl sul- foxide (DMSO), and acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Celebrex was a physician professional sample. 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine was pur- chased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and 3-[p-(6- phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl]phenylpropionic acid was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were prepared in the Bioactive Natural Products and Phytoceuticals Laboratory (BNPP) from ram seminal vesicles and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2), from cloned insect cell lysate, respectively (12). Plant Material and Extract Preparation. Leaves and fruits of I. juruensis were collected in Reserva do Mocambo, in the Amazon forest in January during the rainy season, and identified as Iryanthera juruensis Warburg by botanist Nelson Rosa. A voucher specimen, ID 141860 MG, was deposited at the Herbarium Joa˜o Murc¸a Pires at Museu Paraense Emı´lio Goeldi (Bele´m, PA, Brazil). The dried and ground leaves (111 g) and seeds (53 g) were extracted separately with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol at room temperature, using 3 × 300 mL of each solvent for extraction of leaves and 3 × 130 mL of each solvent for extraction of seeds. Solvents were removed under vacuum by use of a rotary evaporator and afforded the crude extracts hexane (1.4 g), EtOAc (1.8 g), and MeOH (6.4 g) from leaves and hexane (13.5 g), EtOAc (14.1 g), and MeOH (3.3 g) from seeds. Isolation of Constituents. The MeOH extract from the leaves of I. juruensis (3.2 g) was stirred with CHCl3 and filtered to remove the precipitate (1.5 g). The CHCl3-soluble part of this extract was concentrated (1.7 g) and subjected to MPLC on silica gel. Elution with hexane/acetone (H/A) solvent system under gradient conditions (H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; H/A 1:2, 400 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 200 mL) afforded 11 fractions (A1-A3, 100 mL each; A4- A6, 200 mL each; A7, 300 mL; A8 and A9, 250 mL each; and A10 and A11, 200 mL each). Fraction A7 was precipitated with acetone and gave pure compound 3 (17 mg) as a pale yellow precipitate. The acetone-soluble portion was concentrated (240 mg) and was further chromatographed on a silica gel MPLC column with CHCl3/MeOH (C/M) under gradient conditions (CHCl3 100%, 100 mL; C/M 99:1, 100 mL; C/M 49:1, 200 mL; C/M 19:1, 300 mL; C/M 9:1, 200 mL; C/M 4:1, 200 mL; C/M 3:1, 100 mL; C/M 1:1, 100 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) to give 12 fractions (B1-B3, 100 mL each; B4-B5, 150 mL each; B6-B11, 100 mL each; B12, 200 mL). Fractions B2-B4 were combined on the basis of their comparative TLC profiles and submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 19:1 v/v) to give compounds 1 (2.6 mg, Rf 0.5) and 2 (2.2 mg, Rf 0.4). Similarly, silica gel MPLC of fractions A8-A10 (340 mg) eluted with CHCl3/MeOH solvent systems (CHCl3 100%, 100 mL; C/M 99:1, 200 mL; C/M 49:1, 300 mL; C/M 19:1, 400 mL; C/M 9:1, 300 mL; C/M 4:1, 200 mL; C/M 3:1, 100 mL; C/M 1:1, 100 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) afforded 13 fractions (C1 and C2, 200 mL each; C3 and C4, 100 mL each; C5-C10, 150 mL each; C11-C13, 100 mL each). Preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 9:1 v/v) of fraction C6 yielded compounds 4 (6 mg, Rf 0.4) and 5 (4 mg, Rf 0.3). The hexane extract of seeds (5.1 g) was stirred with hot MeOH and was filtered. The MeOH-soluble fraction was concentrated (2.7 g) and subjected to MPLC purification on silica gel with hexane/acetone (H/ A) as the mobile phase under gradient conditions (H/A 49:1, 200 mL; H/A 19:1, 200 mL; H/A 9:1, 400 mL; H/A 4:1, 400 mL; H/A 7:3, 400 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL; MeOH 100%, 100 mL) to afford 28 fractions (D1 and D2, 200 mL each; D3-D6, 100 mL each; D7-D14, 50 mL each; D15- D21, 100 mL each; D22-D25, 50 mL each; D26-D28, 200 mL each). Fraction D12 was precipitated with hexane to give compounds 9a-c (56 mg) as a white precipitate. Fractions D16-D18 (149 mg) were combined and further submitted to MPLC (hexane/acetone gradient: H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 3:1, 300 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 200 mL; acetone 100%, 100 mL) to afford five fractions (E1 and E2, 250 mL each; E3-E5, 300 mL each); preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH, 49:1, v/v) of fraction E4 afforded compound 8 (10 mg, Rf 0.3). Fractions D22-D24 (1.26 g) were pooled and also submitted to MPLC (hexane/acetone gradient: H/A 9:1, 200 mL; H/A 4:1, 300 mL; H/A 7:3, 400 mL; H/A 3:1, 400 mL; H/A 2:1, 300 mL; H/A 1:1, 300 mL; acetone 100%, 200 mL) to afford nine fractions (F1-F3, 300 mL each; F4-F9, 200 mL each), which gave compounds 6 (44 mg) and 7 (18 mg) as brown oils from fractions F8 and F3, respectively. Preparative TLC (hexane/acetone 3:1 v/v) of fraction F6 gave compound 10 (26 mg, Rf 0.4). 2-(4′-Methylpentenyl-3)-10-oxoundecan-2,6-dienoic acid (juruenolic acid, 8): Pale yellow oil; UV λmaxMeOH nm (ϵ): 246 (3800).

Antioxidant Assays: â-Carotene Assay. TLC plates were developed in appropriate solvent systems. After developing and drying, TLC plates were sprayed with a 0.02% solution of â-carotene (Aldrich) in MeOH. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background (10). Each plant extract was tested in two elution systems (CHCl3/ MeOH, 9:1 v/v, and CHCl3/MeOH/H2O, 13:6:1 v/v/v) for observation of low-, medium-, and high-polarity compounds. The yellow spots retained on the TLC plates indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the extracts tested. Lipoperoxidation Inhibition Assay. These antioxidant bioassays were conducted by analysis of model liposome oxidation by use of fluorescence spectroscopy (11). The lipid, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn- glycerol-3-phosphocholine (5 µmol), and fluorescent probe, 3-[p-(6- phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl]-phenylpropionic acid (5 µmol), were com- bined in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dried under vacuum at room temperature. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were produced by resuspension of the lipid-probe mixture [0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.01 M 3-(N-morpholino)- propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) maintained over Chelex 100 resin] followed by 10 freeze-thaw cycles in a dry ice-EtOH bath and 2570 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 55, No. 7, 2007 Silva et al. extrusion (29 times) through a 100 nm pore size membrane. The final assay volume was 2 mL, consisting of 100 µL of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)- piperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer [50 mM HEPES and 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)], 200 µL of 1 M NaCl, 1.64 mL of N2-sparged Millipore purified water, 20 µL of test sample or DMSO (solvent control), and a 20-µL aliquot of liposome suspension. Peroxidation was initiated by addition of 20 µL of FeCl2· 4H2O (0.5 mM) to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM Fe2+. The positive controls BHA, BHT, and R-tocopherol/vitamin E were tested at a final concentration of 10 µM. Fluorescence was measured at 384 nm and monitored at 0, 1, and 3 min and every 3 min thereafter up to 21 min on a Turner model 450 digital fluorometer (Barnstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA). The decrease of relative fluorescence intensity with time indicated the rate of peroxidation. Relative fluorescence (Ft/F0) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence value at a given time t (Ft) by that at t ) 0 min (F0). Cyclooxygenase Enzymes Inhibitory Assay. COX-1 enzyme inhibi- tory assay was conducted with an enzyme preparation from ram seminal vesicles (ca. 0.46 mg of protein/mL in 30 mM Tris buffer, pH 7). COX-2 activity was determined by using a preparation from insect cell lysate and diluting with Tris buffer (pH 7) to give an approximate final concentration of 1.5 mg protein/mL (12, 13). COX assays were measured at 37 °C by observing the initial rate of O2 uptake with a micro oxygen chamber and electrode (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) attached to a YSI model 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instrument, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Each assay mix contained 0.6 mL of 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7), 1 mmol of phenol, and 17 µg of hemoglobin. For each test compound (100 ppm) or standards in DMSO (10 µL), activities were determined following a 2-10 min preincubation of samples with enzyme COX-1 or COX-2 (10-20 µL) in the assay chamber. Celebrex (1.7 ppm) and aspirin (108 ppm) were used as positive controls in this assay. Different concentra- tions of standards used were due to their difference in inhibitory activities and also to achieve a uniform enzyme inhibition at 50%. Reaction was initiated by adding arachidonic acid (10 µL of a 1.64 µM solution). Data were recorded with Quicklog for Windows data acquisition software (Strawberry Tree Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We have evaluated 158 Brazilian plant extracts by TLC for the presence of antioxidant compounds (unpublished data) by spraying the developed TLC plates with â-carotene solution followed by exposure to natural light (10). The results indicated the presence of antioxidants in 56 extracts, based on the observation of persistent yellow spots after exposure of the plates to natural light (10). These 56 plant extracts were then evaluated for their LPO and COX enzyme inhibitory activities. On the basis of the bioassay results, the methanol and hexane extracts of I. juruensis leaves and seeds, respectively, were selected for the isolation of bioactive compounds. In summary, the chro- matographic purification of the leaf-extract afforded 5-deoxy- flavones (1-5) and the seeds extract gave sargachromenol (6), sargaquinoic acid (7), the novel juruenolic acid (8), ω-arylal- kanoic acids (9a-c), and guaiacin (10). The identification of isolates was based mostly on NMR, UV, and MS spectral analysis and comparison with literature data. Compounds 1-5 belonged to the class of flavones lacking a 5-oxy substituent, which was confirmed by the signal at ca. δ 7.90 (d, J ∼8.0 Hz), assigned to H-5, in their 1H NMR spectra. The position of -OCH3 groups in flavones 3 and 4 was established by UV spectral analysis with NaOAc/MeOH and NaOMe/MeOH as shift reagents for determination of the substitution patterns in rings A (band I) and B (band II), respectively (14, 15). Also, the NMR data of these compounds were identical to the reported chemical shift values and further confirmed their identities. Therefore, compound 1 was identified as 7,4′-dimethoxyflavone and was formerly isolated from Virola, a widely occurring neotropical Myristicaceae genus (16), whereas compound 3 was identified as tithonine, previously isolated from Tithonia (Asteraceae) (17). Compounds 2 and 4, identified as fasciculiferin and farnisine, respectively, were reported from Acacia fasciculifera and Acacia farnesiana (Fabaceae) (18, 19). Similarly, compound 5 was identified as 7,4′-dihydroxyflavone, reported from Pterocarpus marsupium (20). The structures of sargachromenol (6) and sargaquinoic acid (7) were also confirmed by NMR and MS spectral analyses. These compounds have been isolated earlier from brown seaweeds from the genera Sargassum and Stipopodium (21, 22) and as repeated isolates from I. juruensis (7). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 8 showed signals for four methyl groups on sp2 carbons at δ 1.59, 1.62, 1.68, and 2.13, which showed correlations to signals at δ 17.7, 15.8, 25.6, and 29.9, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. A triplet at δ 5.98, integrated for one proton, and a multiplet at δ 5.09 for two protons were observed in its 1H NMR spectrum. The 13C NMR signal at δ 172.0, assigned to an R,â-unsaturated carboxyl, and at δ 123.0, 130.0, 132.0, 135.0, and 145.6, assigned to olefinic carbons of an isoprene chain, suggested a partial structure similar to the side chain in compounds 6 and 7. An Bioactive Constituents in Iryanthera juruensis J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 55, No. 7, 2007 2571 additional signal at δ 208.0, which showed HMBC correlation with the singlet at δ 2.13 and the triplet at δ 2.45, indicated a methyl-carbonyl-methylene moiety in the structure of 8 (Figure 1). Also, one quartet at δ 2.60, two triplets at δ 2.08 and 2.11, integrated for two protons each, and one multiplet at δ 2.26, integrated for four protons, were assigned to the allyl-methylene protons. The HMBC correlation between H1′ (δ 2.26) and C1 (COOH, δ 172.6), in addition to correlations of H8 (δ 2.27) to C6 (δ 130.6) and to C10 (CdO, δ 208.8) indicated the position of -COOH moiety at C2. Additional COSY (Figure 2) and HMBC correlations led to the complete assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR signals (Table 1). HRFABMS and FABMS analysis showed peaks at 293.2116 [M + H+] and 585 [2M + H+], respectively, which confirmed the molecular formula as C18H28O3, whereas peaks at m/z 69 and 165 in the FAB mass spectrum (positive ion mode) were assigned to the isopentenyl (C5H9) moiety and to the ion resulting from the loss of isopentenyl and carboxyl moieties [M - C5H9 - COOH]+, respectively. Therefore, the spectral data gave conclusive support to the establishment of the structure of the new compound 8 as 2-(4′-methylpentenyl-3)-10-oxoundecan-2,6-dienoic acid. ω-Arylalkanoic acids 9a-c were identified on the basis of their UV, 1H and 13C NMR, and FABMS spectra and are probably biosynthetic precursors of γ-lactones known as jurue- nolides, which occur widely in Iryanthera species (7, 23). Compound 10 was identified from its spectroscopic data and by comparison with literature values as guaiacin, an aryltetralin lignan, previously isolated from Guaiacum officinale (Zygo- phyllaceae) (24, 25). Flavonoids are by far the most investigated class of natural products regarding antioxidant properties. The aromatic -OH groups and the C2-C3 double bond are some of the features of flavonoids important for their antioxidant activity (26). Flavones 3-5 showed lipoperoxidation inhibition by 95% when tested at 100 ppm. At lower concentration (10 ppm), they were still highly active (Figure 3) and inhibited LPO by 86%, 77%, and 88%, respectively. This suggested that flavones 3-5 offer better protection of lipid membranes from oxidation than sargachromenol (6) or sargaquinoic acid (7). Flavones 1-5 also showed moderate inhibition of COX enzymes. However, the COX-1 enzyme was inhibited the most, by 40-65%, compared to COX-2 enzyme (Figure 4). At 100 ppm, flavones 1 and 2 inhibited COX-2 enzyme by 31% and 51%, respectively, whereas flavones 3-5 showed <20% inhibition. This activity profile might be dependent on their polarity as well as the substitution pattern in ring B. For example, flavones 1 and 2 are fully methoxylated compounds, whereas compounds 3-5 contained free -OH groups in their structures. Moreover, the substitution pattern in ring B seemed to play a major role in determining the COX-2 enzyme activity, as the presence of a 3′,4′-dimethoxy ring B rendered the highest enzyme inhibitory activity among flavones 1-5 tested. Also, lack of a methoxy group in ring B led to a reduction in the activity as shown by flavone 5. The presence of either a 7-OMe or 7-OH group in ring A seemed to be of lesser impact on COX-2 inhibition as shown by compounds 3 and 4, which showed similar activities. In previous studies, sargachromenol (6) was shown to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties that were assessed by electrochemical studies, by reaction with the stable free radical DPPH, and by inhibition of TPA-induced mouse ear edema (7, 27). In this paper, we present additional support of the biological activity of I. juruensis by demonstrating the ability of its isolates to inhibit LPO (76% at 100 ppm) (Figure 3) and COX-1 (98%) and COX-2 (84%) enzymes (Figure 4). In contrast, plastoquinone 7 exhibited poor inhibitory activities of LPO and COX-1 and -2 enzymes. This was probably due to Figure 1. Selected HMBC correlations for compound 8. Figure 2.

Poor inhibitory activities toward COX-1 and -2 enzymes were also observed for compounds 8 and 9. In contrast, arylalkanoic acid 9 inhibited LPO by 79%, whereas compound 8 showed much lower ability to protect liposomes from oxidation (Figure 3b). Guaiacin (10) presented the highest LPO inhibitory activity (>95% at 100 ppm) among the tested compounds from I. juruensis fruits. This was probably due to the presence of two veratryl moieties in its structure, which may increase the hydrogen radical donating ability of the aromatic hydroxyl groups. It also strongly inhibited COX-1 (75% at 100 ppm) enzyme but showed weak activity toward COX-2 (<20% at 100 ppm). The findings of our research on I. juruensis seeds and leaves have clearly shown that the plant parts studied possessed LPO inhibitory activity and were in agreement with the anecdotal reports. In addition, the moderate inhibition of COX-2 enzyme by extracts from seeds and leaves and the isolates from them further suggested the potential health beneficial effects of this plant and validated the ethno uses of I. juruensis decoction by Amazon Indians.

The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent, and the esters were significantly more effective than gallic acid. Gallic acid and its esters were compared with regard to their reactivity to free radicals, using the DPPH and AAPH/pyranine free- cell assays, and no significant difference was obtained. Gallic acid and its esters not only failed to inhibit the depletion of intracellular GSH in erythrocytes induced by AAPH but exacerbated it. Similarly, the oxidation of GSH by AAPH or horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in cell-free systems was exacerbated by gallic acid or gallates. This property could be involved in the recent findings on pro- apoptotic and pro-oxidant activities of gallates in tumor cells. We provide evidence that lipophilicity and not only radical scavenger potency is an important factor regarding the efficiency of anti- hemolytic substances. KEYWORDS: Gallic acid; gallates; erythrocytes; hemolysis; glutathione; peroxyl radical; antioxidant; pro-oxidant activity INTRODUCTION Gallic acid and its derivatives are among the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in wines and green tea (1-3). This phyto- chemical is well-known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti- inflammatory, antimutagenic, and chemopreventive properties (4-7). The similar beneficial effects of the synthetic esters of gallic acid have been extensively studied, and in many cases, they are stronger than those of gallic acid itself. For instance, lauryl gallate (dodecyl gallate), a widely used food additive, is more efficient than gallic acid as an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, and of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by FeIII-NADPH (8). Methyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid at inhibiting oral bacterial growth and the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms (4). Methyl gallate inhibits the production of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2 by bone-marrow-derived mast cells (9). Nonyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid against the growth of Salmonella choleraesuis (10). Lauryl gallate protects against the formationofdimethylbenzanthracene-inducedskintumorsinmice and kills, selectively, tumor cells in established tumors (11). Such biological activities have been correlated with the amphipathic feature of these ester derivatives (12), because the in vitro antioxi- dantpotentialisnearlythesameas thatofgallicacid. Hence, itmay be supposed that the accessibility of the gallates to the intracellular medium could be a determining factor for their effects. Another relevant property of gallates is their pro-oxidant characteristics. Indeed, the cytotoxic effect of octyl, dodecyl, and tetradecyl gallates on melanoma cells has recently been demonstrated (13, 14). This biological effect has been associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of NF-κB, inhibition of cell adhesion, and alteration of the cell redox status by depletion of both glutathione (GSH) and ATP (13). Similarly, the inhibition of HeLa cell growth by propyl gallate was associated with depletion of intracellular GSH and increased production of the superoxide anion (14). The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced disruption of cell membranes and the protective effect of antioxi- dants. One of the most frequently studied models uses the water- solubleazocompound2,20-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), which decomposes at physiological temperature (37 C) *To whom correspondence should be addressed: Departamento de Quı´mica, Faculdade de Ci^encias, UNESP, Bauru, SP, CEP 17033-360, Brazil.

In the presence of dissolved molecular oxygen, this radical is converted to the corresponding peroxyl radical (ROO•) (15). The mechanism of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by thermolysis of AAPH is not completely understood, but it has been correlated with lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins (16). The incubation of erythro- cytes with AAPH also provokes the depletion of intracellular GSH (17). Because the above biological phenomenon is associated with the disruption of the cell membrane and in view of increasing evidence that the lipophilicity of gallic acid esters is decisive for their beneficial effects, here, we aimed to synthesize selected gallate esters and compare their efficacy as inhibitors of AAPH- induced hemolysis and GSH depletion. The objective was to retain the same oxidizable moiety while altering the lipophili- city. Additionally, we studied and compared the antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of gallic acid and gallates in cell-free systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and Equipments. Gallic acid,vanillicacid,methylvanillate, (()-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), (()-R-tocopherol (vitamin E), 2,20-azobis(2- amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), 5,50-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), glutathione (GSH), 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (pyranine), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), N,N0- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, cumene hydroperoxide (Cu-OOH), horserad- ish peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1.7), and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was prepared bydiluting a 30% stock solution and calcul- ating its concentration from its absorption at 240 nm (ε240=43.6 M-1 cm-1) (18). Column chromatography was carried out over 0.06-0.20 mm silica gel (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). Gel permeation chromato- graphy (GPC) was performed with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out in a Varian Prep-Star 400 system with a Pheno- menex C-18 (250 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvents (Aldrich). All of the reagents used for buffers and mobile phases were analytical-grade. Stock solutions of antioxidants were prepared in ethyl alcohol. Ultrapure Milli-Q water from Millipore was used for the preparation of buffers and solutions. Gallic Acid Source. Gallic acid was extracted from Alchornea glandulosa. The leaves were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac-u, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen(SP319257) has beendeposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (S~ao Paulo, SP, Brazil). The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L 3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH/H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After solvent removal in a rotary evaporator, the partition phases yielded 2.5 and 0.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromato- graphed bygel permeation over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol, to afford 11 fractions (A1-A11). Second-stage chromatographic purifica- tion of fraction A2 (730 mg) by reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC (7.5:92:0.5 MeOH/H2O/HOAc, UV detection at 265 nm, and flow rate at 15 mL/min) yielded gallic acid (335 mg). The identification was based on analysis of 1H and 13C NMR data, as well as by a comparison to authentic material obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Synthesis of Esters (Methyl, Propyl, and Lauryl). A 3 mL solution of N,N0-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane was added to a cooled (5 C) solution of 0.2 mmol of gallic acid and 20 mmol of methyl, propyl, or lauryl alcohol in 6 mL of p-dioxane. After the solution was stirred for 48 h, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned 3 times with EtOAc and filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (3 times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (3 times), and water (2 times), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column eluted isocratically with CHCl3/MeOH (98:2). Structures of the semi-synthetic esters were estab- lished by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis. Erythrocyte Suspension. Human erythrocytes from healthy donors were obtained from peripheral blood, centrifuged at 770g for 10 min, and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. The supernatant and buffy coat were removed by aspiration after each wash. The cells were resuspended to 20% (v/v) in PBS. The blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers. The study was approved by the faculty research ethics committee. Hemolysis Assays. The hemolysis studies were performed as pre- viously described (19), with modifications. Equal amounts of erythrocytes suspension and 100 mM AAPH in PBS were gently homogenized while being incubated for 6 h at 37 C (blood tube rotator). Aliquots (75 μL) were removed at regular intervals, diluted 1:20 with PBS, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The degree of hemolysis was measured in the supernatant by its absorbance at 540 nm. Reference values (100% hemolysis) were determined with the same aliquot of erythrocytes but diluted in 1500 μL of distilled water instead of PBS to provoke the total lysis of the erythrocytes. By diluting the 100% hemolysis sample in PBS, a calibration curve of percent hemolysis against absorbance was constructed for conversion of the absorbance measurement to degrees of hemolysis. The blank was PBS, and measurements were made in a UV-1240 spectro- photometer (Shimadzu, Japan). When used, 10 μL aliquots of inhibitors in ethanol were added at the beginning of the reaction. The same volume of ethyl alcohol (10 μL) was added to the negative (without AAPH) and positive (with AAPH) controls. In the studies where cumene hydroper- oxide (Cu-OOH) was the hemolytic agent, this compound (500 μM) was used instead of AAPH. Determination of Intracellular GSH. The intracellular concentra- tion of GSH in erythrocytes was determined using the DTNB method (19), with modifications. The 20% suspension of erythrocytes (100 μL) was incubated with 100 μL of 50 mM AAPH at 37 C for 2.0 h. After incubation, the suspension was diluted to 1000 μL with PBS and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was lysed by adding 700 μL of distilled H2O. The protein in 700 μL of lysate was precipitated by adding 500 μL of an aqueous solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After 5 min, the protein precipitate was separated from the remaining solution by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (500 μL) was made alkaline by adding 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 62.5 μL of NaOH (1 M). Next, 450 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 100 μL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate) were added to 450 μL of the alkaline mixture. In the blank, 500 μL of supernatant was mixed with 250 μL of PBS instead of 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 and 62.5 μL of NaOH, after which 450 μL of PBS and 100 μL of DTNB were added to 450 μL of this mixture. Each sample test or control had its blank. The absorbance was read at 412 nm. A standard curve was constructed to measure the concentration of GSH. In this case, 700 μL of lysate was replaced by 700 μL of solutions of GSH at several concentrations. The hemoglobin content (Hb) in an aliquot of the lysate (prior precipitation with TCA) was determined by the cyanohemoglobin method. The GSH values were expressed as μmol/g Hb (20). Oxidation of GSH by AAPH. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 2.5 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C for 1.0 h (21). When present,gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added beforethe addition of AAPH. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured bythe DTNB method as follows: 0.45 mL of the reaction mixture was added to 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.1 mL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate). The absorbance at 412 nm was read against a blank consisting of 0.45 mL of PBS, 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.1 mL of DTNB. An analytical curve was produced using standard GSH solutions, which were submitted to the DTNB methods. Oxidation of GSH by HRP/H2O2. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at 37 C (21). When present, gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured by the DTNB method as above. Measurement of GSH and GSSG by HPLC. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at Article J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5357 37 C. When present, apocynin, gallic acid, and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The concentration of GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection, as previously described (22): For GSH determination, 50 μL of the above reaction mixture was added to 1.0 mL of 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. To a 20 μL aliquot of this mixture, 300 μL of 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0 and 20 μL of 0.1% OPA in methanol were added and this reaction mixture was incubated at 25 C for 15 min in the dark in well-capped tubes, after which 20μL ofeachsamplewas injectedintothe HPLCsystem. For GSSG determination, a 200 μL aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 C with 200 μL of 40 mM NEM, for 25 min, in the dark, to react with the GSH present in the sample. To this mixture, 750 μL of 0.1 M NaOH was added. A 20 μL portion of this mixture was taken for measurement of GSSG, using the procedure outlined above for the GSH assay, except that 0.1 M NaOH was employed as the diluent rather than 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. The HPLC method for the determination of GSH and GSSG is based on derivatization with OPA to form a stable, highly fluorescent derivative (23). The derivatives of GSH and GSSG were separated by liquid chromatography (Varian ProStar in line with a fluorescence detector set at 350/420 nm). The analyses were carried out isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of 15% methanol in 25 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 6.0 (flow rate of 0.5 mL/min). Measurement of Oxygen Consumption. The consumption of dis- solved molecular oxygen during the oxidation of GSH was monitored in a YSI 5300A oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring, OH). The reaction mixture of 1 mM GSH, 100 μM H2O2, and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS was incubated at 37 C in the presence or absence (control) of 10 μM apocynin or gallates. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. The oxygen consumption was monitored for 10 min. Pyranine-Based Procedure for Evaluation of the Reactivity of Gallates with Peroxyl Radicals Generated by AAPH Thermolysis. This experiment was performed as described by Lissi et al. (24), with minor modifications. The experiments were based on the decay in the fluores- cence of pyranine when it was submitted to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compound pyranine (5 μM) was incubated with 20 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C in the absence (control) or presence of gallates in the wells of a microplate. The fluorescence bleaching of the pyranine was monitored at λex=460 nm and λem=510 nm in a Spectramax M2 micro- plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The final reaction volume was 300 μL. The lag phase (induction time) obtained when the antioxidants were present was measured for various concentrations of each gallate. The slopes of the curves of induction time versus concentra- tion were used to measure the relative reactivity of the gallates with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. Free-Radical Scavenging Activity on DPPH/DPPH Bleaching Assay. The free-radical scavenger activity of gallic acid and its esters was compared by the DPPH bleaching assay (25). The antioxidants were incubated for 30 min with 100 μM DPPH in methyl alcohol in the dark. The scavenger activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm, using the absorbance of the unreacted DPPH radical as the control. The scavenger activity was calculated as ((absorbance of the control - absorbance of the sample)/absorbance of the control) 100. RESULTS We studied the hemolysis of erythrocytes and the protective effect of gallic acid and its esters. The molecular structures of the compounds studied are shown in Figure 1. Hemolysis was provoked by thermolysis of the azo compound AAPH, which generates a low but constant flux of peroxyl radicals when incubated at 37 C (15). Figure 2 shows the kinetic profile of hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid and propyl gallate. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent (Figure 3), and the esters methyl gallate (G1), propyl gallate (G3), and lauryl gallate (G12) were more effective inhibitors than their acid precursor, gallic acid (G0) (Table 1). Because the above results suggest a higher efficacy of the esters as free-radical scavengers, we also compared their relative potency in cell-free models. First, they were compared as scav- engers of the stable free-radical DPPH. The results depicted in Table 2 show that no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its ester derivatives. In a second set of experiments, we studied the direct reactivity of gallic acid and its esters with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. In this assay, the relative reactivity of the antioxidants with peroxyl radicals is determined by the lag phase in the decay of pyranine fluorescence (24). Figure 4 shows the typical time profile of the bleaching obtained when pyranine was incubated with AAPH in the presence of gallic acid and methyl gallate. The linear relation between the delay and the concentration of gallic acid or gallates was used to measure the reactivity of the tested compound with AAPH. In this design, the slope of the curve is directly proportional to the efficiency of the antioxidant as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals. Figure 4 also shows the typical linear correlation between the concentration and lag phase for gallic acid and methyl gallate. The slopes obtained were 442 ( 30 for gallic acid, 499 ( 31 for methyl gallate, 453 ( 6 for propyl gallate, and 187 ( 7 for lauryl gallate (mean ( SEM, n = 3). As can be observed, only lauryl gallate presented a Figure 1. Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study. Figure 2. AAPH-induced hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3). The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C. The results are mean ( standard error of the mean (SEM) of duplicates of three separate experiments. 5358 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 Ximenes et al. decreased reactivity with peroxyl radicals in this experimental model. Considering the above cell-free studies, the stronger antihemo- lytic effect of the gallates, relative to that of gallic acid, suggests that lipophilicity is a determining factor in this experimental model. To verify this proposal, we also compared the antioxidant vanillic acid versus its methyl ester (methyl vanillate) and trolox, a morewater-soluble form ofvitamin E,versusvitamin E itself. The results with these two different classes of antioxidants followed the same pattern as that for gallates and gallic acid, reinforcing the suggestion that lipophilicity of antioxidants is crucial with respect to antihemolytic protection (Table 1). The direct hemolytic capacity of gallic acid and gallates was also investigated, because these compounds could interact with and disrupt the erythrocyte membrane. In these experiments, gallic acid and gallates were incubated with erythrocytes with- out AAPH. The results in Table 3 show that only the 12-carbon ester lauryl gallate caused significant hemolysis after incubation for 6 h. The protective effect of gallates was not restricted to AAPH- induced hemolysis. The results given in Table 4 show that gallates were also effective when the hemolysis was provoked by incuba- tion of erythrocytes with cumene hydroperoxide. Again, there was a correlation with lipophilicity. In a further experiment, the protective effect of gallic acid and gallates on the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by AAPH was also studied. Despite their antihemolytic properties, gallic acid and gallates were unable to inhibit the oxidation of GSH when erythrocytes were incubated with AAPH. On the contrary, the depletion of GSH was exacerbated by methyl and lauryl gallates (Table 5). To clarify these findings, we studied the direct reaction between pure GSH and AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and tested the effect of gallic acid and gallates on this reaction. Again, the presence of gallic acid and gallates tended to exacerbate the oxidation of GSH (Figure 5). In another set of experiments, pure GSH was oxidized by H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by HRP. Because GSH is a poor substrate for peroxidase, the efficiency of oxidation was low (26). However, the addition of gallic acid and gallates caused a strong increase in the oxidation of GSH (Figure 6). It is well-known that some phenolic compounds are able to act as a co-catalyst in reactions of inefficient peroxidase substrates, such as GSH. In such situations, the oxidized intermediate phenolic radical is reduced back and GSH is converted to GSSG. Moreover, during this redox cycle, the dissolved molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture is consumed, being reduced to superoxide anion (27). For these reasons and in light of our results, we measured the production of GSSG and the oxygen consumption as GSH was oxidized by HRP/H2O2 in the presence of gallic acid or gallates. To ascertain whether our experimental conditions for assessing the co-catalytic effectof phenols upon the oxidation of GSH was correct, we used apocynin, which is able to initiate this process, as a reference compound (28). As can be seen in Figure 7, both gallic acid and apocynin exacerbated the oxidation of GSH; however, only in the presence of apocynin was GSSG obtained as a product. Similarly, only in the presence of apocynin was the consumption of dissolved oxygen observed (Figure 8). The other gallates showed the same results as gallic acid (data not shown). DISCUSSION The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model in the study of ROS-induced disruption of cell membranes. The inhibitory property of many antioxidants upon AAPH-induced hemolysis is well-documented (29-32). However, there is no clear relationship between the molecular structure of the antioxidants and their efficiency as inhibitors. Here, working with gallic acid and its ester derivatives, we found Figure 3. Concentration-dependent effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3) on AAPH-induced hemolysis. The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 C. The results are mean ( SEM of duplicates of three separate experiments.

Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5359 that lipophilicity seems to be an essential characteristic of an efficient antihemolytic compound. Similar findings were reported by Wu et al. that ranked the antihemolytic efficiency of gallates as propyl > ethyl > methyl (33). Corroborating this proposal, the correlation between efficacy against AAPH-induced hemolysis and lipophilicity was not restricted to gallic acid and its ester derivatives but extended to other classes of molecules, such as vanillic acid versus its lipophilic derivative methyl vanillate and trolox versus vitamin E. Moreover, the benefit of lipophilicity was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis, because it was also seen when the erythrocytes were challenged with cumene hydro- peroxide. Reinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, our result showed clearly that higher antihemolytic efficacy of the gallates was not related to their oxidizability. Indeed, except for lauryl gallate, no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its esters in their potential as antioxidants in cell-free systems. Only the 12-carbon chain ester was relatively poor as a peroxyl radical scavenger in the cell-free systems. Despite that and again reinfor- cing the importance of lipophilicity, lauryl gallate was a more efficient inhibitor of hemolysis than gallic acid. It is important to observe that any compound used as an antihemolytic agent when erythrocytes are challenged by free Figure 4.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 Ximenes et al. radicals could also interact directly with the cell membrane and provoke its disruption. This effect has been described, and there is a relationship between lipophilicity and hemolytic capacity deve- loped by many compounds (34, 35). Accordingly, lauryl gallate, the most lipophilic compound used in this study, was the only ester capable of inducing hemolysis of erythrocytes under our experimental conditions. Other important findings include the interaction of gallic acid and gallates with GSH. This chemical feature could explain or be involved in the recent findings about cellular pro-oxidant effects of gallates (13, 14). This tripeptide is the main endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) reflects directly the redox status of the cell (36). It is well-known that redox homeostasis is crucial for cells to survive, and the pathophysiological mecha- nisms ofseveral diseasesare related tothe exacerbated production of ROS and/or decreased antioxidant functions (37). In fact, apoptosis, which is altered in tumor cells, strongly depends upon the GSH/GSSG ratio (38, 39). Two pathways could explanation the exacerbated oxidation of GSH whengallates are present in the reaction mixture or cellular medium. The first is the action of these compounds as co-catalysts, where the intermediate pheno- xyl radical would be reduced back to gallate with concomitant oxidation of GSH. This phenomenon is well-established for phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine and apocynin (27, 28), and the consequence of this redox cycle is the consumption of GSH, the formation of GSSG, and the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion (40). This was exactly what we observed for apocynin, used as a model for a comparison to gallates in this study. However, when gallates were used, the consumption of GSH was not followed by the formation of GSSG and the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Hence, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for the augmented depletion of GSH caused by gallic acid and gallates. The second possible explanation for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates in the depletion of intracellular GSH is a chemical reaction between the oxidized trihydroxybenzene moi- ety, probably in its quinone form, and GSH via the Michael Figure 5.

This is a well-known reaction that involves electrophilic quinones and nucleophilic substances, such as GSH, leading to thiol adducts (41,42). In this case, the consumption of GSH is not followed by the formation of GSSG and oxygen consumption, as verified here. In summary, Scheme 1 shows our proposal for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates when these compounds were oxidized in the presence of GSH, which could explain the depletion of intracellular GSH as verified here and by others (13, 14).

The isolates were submitted to in vitro evaluation of lipoperoxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and -2) inhibitory properties and showed moderate antioxidant activities (40–70%) at 100 ppm when compared to commercial standards BHT and vitamin E and moderate inhibition of COX-1 (ca. 40%) and marginal inhibition of COX-2 enzymes (<10%) at 100 ppm when compared to nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin, rofecoxib, and celecoxib, respectively. The chemotaxonomy of widely occurring Senna and Cassia (Fabaceae) species has been the subject of extensive studies, leading to reclassiﬁcation of some species, including Cassia spectabilis.1 Both of these genera exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties and ethnomedical uses, especially those associated with inﬂammation.2–6 In Brazil, the tea of their crushed leaves is used to treat throat inﬂammation and diarrhea.7 Therefore, many plants belonging to Senna and Cassia species have been or are being studied for their anti-inﬂammatory botanical extracts or for the isolation of new metabolites with unique chemical structures, mode of action, selectivity, and/or effectiveness. Extracts of species from both genera have been investigated for anti-inﬂammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo assays. For example, Cassia italica is one of the most studied species due to its analgesic, antipyretic, laxative, and antitumor properties.8 Its ethanolic extract decreased the severity of rat paw edema in a potency comparable to acetylsalycilic acid and inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis by rat peritoneal leucocytes.9 An extract of Senna dariensis has been used against snakebite and was highly active in the inhibition of the hemorrhagic effect of the venom from Bothrops atrox,10 whereas Senna neglecta and Senna alata have been used in southern Brazil and Thailand, respectively, to treat inﬂammation linked to microbial infection.11,12 Cassia tora and C. angustifolia leaf extracts have also shown anti-inﬂammatory properties using in vivo models with histamine-induced rat hind paw edema and 12-O-tetradecanoylphor- bol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema, respectively, whereas C. ﬁstula leaves methanolic extract was evaluated in in vitro models and efﬁciently protected free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in model membranes and also inhibited the 5-lipoxy- genase-mediated peroxidation of arachidonic acid.13–15 As part of our ongoing research on active metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of São Paulo State (Brazil), we have recently reported the isolation of several new piperidine alkaloids including (-)-spectaline (2), (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (3), and (+)-spectaline from leaves, ﬂowers, and ripe fruits of Senna spectabilis, which showed anti-inﬂammatory and acetylcholinest- erase inhibitory properties.16–18 Herein we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new piperidine alkaloid, (+)-3-O- feruloylcassine (1), from unripe fruits of Senna spectabilis ((DC.) Irwin & Barneby), along with the identiﬁcation of the known alkaloids 2 and 3. In addition, we also report their free radical scavenging potential toward DPPH, lipoperoxidation (LPO), and cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitory activities. Compound 1 was isolated as a pale yellow solid (mp 7–74 °C). HRESIMS and elemental analysis of 1 indicated the molecular formula C28H43NO5, with eight degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum suggested the presence of secondary amine (3413, 1514 cm-1), ketone (1710 cm-1), and oleﬁnic (3050, 1629, 1529 cm-1) moieties. The 1H NMR spectroscopic signals for two vicinal oleﬁnic methines at δ 7.68 (d, J ) 15.5 Hz, H-7′′) and δ 6.36 (d, J ) 15.5 Hz, H-8′′) with a trans relative conﬁguration, three aromatic methines at δ 7.06 (brs, H-2′′), δ 7.00 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, H-6′′), and δ 6.82 (d, J ) 8.5 Hz, H-5′′), and three methoxyl protons at δ 3.81 (s, H-10′′) suggested a feruloyl moiety in compound 1. This spectrum also gave signals for one oxymethine hydrogen at δ 4.99 (brs, H-3), three methyl protons at δ 1.19 (m, H-7), and two methines at δ 3.14 (m, H-2) and 2.80 (m, H-6). The two multiplets at δ 1.62 and 1.48, integrated for four protons, were assigned to H-4eq/H-5eq and H-4ax/H-5ax, respectively, on the basis of correla- tions observed in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum. Signals for methylene protons at δ 1.48 (m, H-1′), 1.16–1.21 (m, H-2′-H-9′), and 2.34 (t, 7.5 Hz, H-10′) and methyl protons at δ 2.06 (s, H-12′) clearly indicated a long saturated side chain as previously observed in compounds 2 and 3.16 The 13C NMR and DEPT-135° spectra showed signals for three methine carbons at δ 69.0, 56.9, and 54.4, * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Prod. 2007, 70, 2026–2028 2026 10.1021/np070312g CCC: $37.00 2007 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 11/30/2007 methylene carbons at δ 29.1–29.7, and one methyl carbon at δ 16.9, which strongly supported the 2,6-disubstituted-piperidin-3-ol ring similar to those reported for (-)-spectaline (2) and (-)-3-O- acetylspectaline (3)16 (Figure 1). The joint analysis of the 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and HMBC spectra evidenced signals for a carbonyl carbon at δ 209.6, correlating to methylene protons at δ 2.34 and to methyl protons at δ 2.06, which were assigned to a terminal methyl ketone subunit on the side chain at C-6. The carboxyl signal at δ 166.7 correlated to the oleﬁnic methine at δ 7.68 in the HMBC spectrum and suggested an R,- unsaturated conjugation between the piperidine unit and the 1,3,4- trisubstituted aromatic ring. The downﬁeld value of the methine carbon at δ 69.0, when compared to that in (-)-spectaline (δ 67.9), and its correlation with the H-7 methyl protons led us to propose a conjugated ester at C-3 on the piperidine ring. The HMBC correlations observed for the methoxy protons at δ 3.81 to the quaternary carbon at δ 147.0 and for the aromatic methines H-2′′ (δ 7.06), H-5′′ (δ 6.82) to the carbon at δ 148.3 evidenced the presence of aromatic methoxy and hydroxy substituents at C-3′′ and C-4′′ (Figure 1). The NOESY 1D experiment indicated the position of methoxy at C-3′′ and hydroxy at C-4′′ on the basis of the sole spatial correlation of the methoxy protons and H-2′′. All of these assignments were conﬁrmed by additional HMBC cor- relations and led us to propose the structure of 2-methyl-3-feruloyl- 6-(dodecyl-11′-one)piperidine for compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed by the molecular ion peak at m/z 474.3198 in its HRESIMS. The relative conﬁgurations at C-2, C-3, and C-6 were established by comparison of the coupling constants observed for 1 with those published for 2 and 316,19 and NOESY 1D experiments. The irradiation of the H-2 signal conﬁrmed its relative spatial correla- tions to H-3, H-4ax, H-6, and H-7 protons as cis. Therefore, the structure of 1 was assigned as (+)-2-methyl-3-feruloyl-6-(dodecyl- 11′-one)piperidine. The free radical scavenging activity of compounds 1–3 was evaluated spectrophotometrically by using the stable free radical DPPH and measuring the decrease in absorption at 517 nm. Compounds 2 and 3 were weakly active in this assay and exhibited absorbance variation lower than 10% at 60 ppm. However, compound 1 showed moderate activity (%∆A ) 40% at 60 ppm) when compared to the standard rutin (%∆A ) 92% at 60 ppm), which may be associated with the presence of a feruloyl moiety in the structure of 1. The lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity of the isolates was evaluated by measurement of the ﬂuorescence decay after adding Fe2+ to initiate the oxidation of large unilamellar vesicles. The alkaloids were tested at 100 ppm, the extract was tested at 250 ppm, and commercial antioxidants BHT, BHA, and vitamin E were used as standard reference compounds at 1.9, 2.2, and 4.3 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids 2 and 3 exhibited moderate inhibition (ca. 75% after 21 min, Figure 2) of the liposome peroxidation. Alkaloid 1 showed only 50% inhibition of the LPO, despite the presence of a feruloyl moiety in its structure, which is normally associated with an increase in antioxidant activity. This behavior might be at least partly explained by the possible chelation of Fe2+ ions by compounds 2 and 3, in contrast to the poor ability for Fe2+ chelation of compound 1. The use of AAPH as the free radical initiator, instead of Fe2+, conﬁrmed this observation by showing a similar trend in lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (ca. 50%) by compounds 1–3. Inhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzyme activity of compounds 1-3 was evaluated by polarographic measurement of the oxygen uptake during the COX-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Each alkaloid was tested at 100 ppm and compared to standard reference compounds rofecoxib, celecoxib, and aspirin, which were tested at 1.7, 1.7, and 108 ppm, respectively. Alkaloids 1-3 inhibited COX-1 enzyme by 33, 40, and 58%, respectively. However, the inhibitory activities of COX-2 enzyme by these compounds were marginal (Figure 3). In summary, we have isolated three alkaloids (1–3) from the green fruits of S. spectabilis, which showed weak to moderate free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH and moderate lipoper- oxidation inhibitory properties. In addition, these compounds displayed moderate anti-inﬂammatory activities, especially toward COX-1. Additional research is needed to further explain the anecdotal medicinal claims of this fruit and its potential to be considered as a medicinal or dietary supplement. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were mea- sured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 °C. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X FT spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using the ESI mode and MeOH-H2O (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V). Al2O3 grade I, type WN-3 and silica gel (200–400 mesh) were used in column chromatography and TLC; visualization of TLC plates was made by spraying with iodochloro- platinate reagent (Merck) and Dragendorff’s reagent.

Plant material was collected in February 2004 from a specimen of Senna spectabilis cultivated in the Chemistry Institute at Sao Paulo State University (Araraquara-SP). A voucher (SP 370917) was deposited at the herbarium of São Paulo Botanic Garden, São Paulo-SP, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. Green fruits of S. spectabilis (8 kg) were ground and extracted with EtOH (5 × 5 L). Evaporation of solvent yielded 676 g of a crude extract (8.5%). The extract was analyzed by TLC (silica gel, CHCl3-MeOH-NH4OH, 36:3:1) to conﬁrm the presence of alkaloids by spraying with Dragendorff and iodochloro- platinate reagents. This extract (9 g) was then suspended in MeOH-H2O, 4:1, the insoluble residue was removed by ﬁltration, and the remaining solution was partitioned successively with hexanes, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. Analysis of the organic fractions by TLC revealed that most of the alkaloidal constituents were concentrated in the CH2Cl2 fraction (5.7 g). An aliquot of the CH2Cl2 fraction (1 g) was then fractionated by neutral alumina column chromatography (hexanes/Et2O and Et2O/MeOH gradients) to give 30 fractions. Fractions 1–3 (30.4 mg) were further puriﬁed by neutral alumina column chromatography (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 99:1) and gave compounds 2 (3.4 mg) and 3 (9 mg). Fractions 28–30 (402.6 mg) showed strong UV absorption at 254 nm. An aliquot (200 mg) of this mixture was puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc-MeOH-TEA, 90:9.9: 0.1) to give alkaloid 1 (20.2 mg).

Dihydrochalcones 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed signiﬁcant inhibitory activity against all the targets. Com- pounds 1−4 displayed IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM against cruzain; dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 inhibited the growth of three diﬀerent strains of P. falciparum in low micromolar concentrations; and against cathepsins B and L these compounds presented good inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM. The dihydrochalcones showed good selectivity in their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteases. F or thousands of years, plants have been used as medicines. They represent a source of structurally complex and unusual substances and are therefore an extremely attractive target for chemical and biological studies. One of the rational forms of study in the search for new potential drugs can be through screening, where a wide variety of extracts can be used for speciﬁc biological tests to obtain one or more metabolites with pharmacological potential.1 Metrodorea stipularis belongs to the family Rutaceae, a family that has a wide diversity of metabolites with large structural diversity that expresses diﬀerent pharmacological properties. Only two species of the Metrodorea genus have been investigated for their chemical constituents: M. nigra and M. flavida. M. nigra is the only species shown to contain dihydrochalcones. In addition to Metrodorea, Esenbeckia is, as of yet, the only genus found to produce this class of compound in the Rutaceae family.2−4 Chagas disease aﬀects 8 million people in Latin America, leading to an annual economic loss of approximately $18 billion. This disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. There are only two drugs used for the treatment of this disease, nifurtimox and benznidazole. The former has been banned in some countries of South America, and both cause serious side eﬀects. Cruzipain (cruzain) is an enzyme that participates in the pathway of proteolytic digestion of the parasite and plays an essential role in its life process; thus, it is an interesting biological target in the search for new compounds that can be used in the treatment of this disease.5−8 Plasmodium falciparum is the most malignant of the species causing malaria, and the progressive increase of resistant parasite strains to antimalarials has initiated studies aimed at developing new drugs that may help in the chemotherapy of this disease. Artemisinin and quinine used in the treatment of this disease are plant natural products.9 Cathepsins are cysteine proteases involved in several pathological situations, such as in the progression of malignant tumors and metastases, infectious disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. The malignant tumors are mostly nonencapsulated and invasive, making it diﬃcult for surgical resection. Evidence suggests that cathepsins B and L may facilitate the progression of tumors, and studies of the expression of these enzymes in diﬀerent types of cancer have shown an increase in the expression of cathepsins in humans.10,11 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In a search for new antichagasic compounds, extracts from several Brazilian plants of the Rutaceae family were evaluated against cruzain. The dichloromethane fraction from liquid− Received: June 4, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/jnp © XXXX American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy A dx.doi.org/10.1021/np500453x | J. Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX liquid partitioning of the crude ethanol extract from the stems of M. stipularis showed the most promising results, with inhibition of 80% against cruzain at a concentration of 100 μg/ mL. Phytochemical study of this fraction led to the active dihydrochalcones: 1-[3-(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)-2,4,6- trihydroxyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one (1),4 1- (5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2), 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dime- thylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)- phenyl]propan-1-one (3), and 1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,3,4,4a,9a-hexahydro-1H- xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4). This class of compounds was previously isolated from this genus.2 Compounds 2 and 3 were obtained as amorphous powders. The ESITOFMS data for both showed the molecular ion at m/ z 410.2066 and 410.2040 (calculated 410.2094) for 2 and 3, respectively. The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 1) provided the same molecular formula of C25H30O5 for both compounds. The 1H NMR spectra for 2 and 3 showed one singlet at δ 5.92 attributed to H-8′, the only proton in ring A revealing the substitution observed for 1. However, for both 2 and 3 the presence of a 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring was characterized by signals at δ 1.76 (H-3′) and 2.53 (H-4′) and the methyl groups at δ 1.33 (H-9′ and H-10′). Further analysis revealed the presence of an ABX coupling pattern with signals at δ 6.91 (H-5″ and H-7″) and 6.56 (H-8″) for 2 and signals at δ 6.87 (H-2″), 6.83 (H-6″), and 6.64 (H-5″) for 3 assigned to the protons in the B ring. Compound 2 showed the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring that was characterized by signals at δ 1.73 (H-3″) and 2.69 (H-4″) and the signals of the methyl groups at δ 1.22 (H-8″ and H-9″). Compound 3 displayed one prenyl group that was suggested from the characteristic signals of the two methyl groups at δ 1.68 and 1.69 (H-4‴ and H-5‴), one oleﬁnic hydrogen at δ 5.28 (H-2‴), and the methylene signal at δ 3.25 (H-1‴). 13C NMR data were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC spectra as in 1 and conﬁrmed the structures of 2 and 3. Compound 4 was obtained as an amorphous powder. The ESITOFMS data showed the molecular ion at m/z 478.2714 (calculated m/z 478.2720). The mass and 13C NMR data (Table 2) provided its molecular formula as C30H38O5. As mentioned for compounds 2 and 3, the 1H NMR spectrum showed the same substitution pattern for both A and B rings. The presence of a cyclized geranyl moiety yielding a hydroxanthene-type skeleton was suggested from the character- istic signals of the three methyl groups at δ 1.18, 0.93, and 1.01 and the methylene signals at δ 1.65, 2.16, 1.48, 1.63, 1.58, and 1.90. 13C NMR values were obtained from projections of the HSQC and HMBC data and conﬁrmed the structure of 4. The dihydrochalcones 1−4 showed inhibition activities against cruzain, with IC50 values ranging from 7.7 to 21.6 μM (Table 3). Although the dihydrochalcones have not been isolated from all the subfractions from the dichloromethane fraction, their presence was observed by 1H NMR spectra in practically all of the active subfractions. Thus, the observed enzyme inhibition is most likely due to the presence of this class of compounds. This is the ﬁrst report of cruzain inhibitory activity for this class of compounds, as well as related to Chagas disease studies. Dihydrochalcones showed inhibitory activity and selectivity for cathepsins B and L with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 14.9 μM (Table 4). The dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 displayed selectivity and inhibition of cathepsin B, while dihydrochal- cones 1 and 3 showed inhibition of cathepsin L. This result is interesting and encourages more studies using these com- pounds, which may be implicated as prototypes for more eﬀective treatments in cancer chemotherapy. Other dihydro- chalcones have already been described as inhibitors of other cathepsins such as cathepsin K.12 The dihydrochalcones were also tested against Plasmodium falciparum growth using the 3D7 (wild type), Dd2, and W2 strains (both chloroquine resistant). Against P. falciparum the dihydrochalcones 2 and 4 showed signiﬁcant growth inhibition of the parasite, and the EC50 values are collated in Table 4. The inhibitory activity was similar for the three strains, and the assays were run in quadruplicate. The positive control used was bromophycolide A, which presents a consistent EC50 value around 0.5 μM for all the strains.13 There is no previous report of activity against P. falciparum growth for this class of compounds. Four compounds were tested against the cysteine proteases cruzain and cathepsins B and L and also against three strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The results described in this paper are signiﬁcant, since this is the ﬁrst report of dihydrochalcones with antiplasmodial activity and as inhibitors of these enzymes implied in Chagas disease and cancer. The compounds showed good activity against cruzain, and it is interesting that compounds 2 and 4 are active against cathepsin B, while compounds 1 and 3 are active against cathepsin L. Given the importance of ﬁnding new drug candidates against Chagas disease, malaria, and cancer, the dihydrochalcones represent a new class of compounds to be investigated in this context. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. All commercially available reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co., and the solvents used for extract preparation and chromatographic fractionation were obtained from Vetec. The NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-d6 and methanol-d4, using TMS as the internal reference, on a Bruker Avance III 9.4 T spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) equipped with manual change of sample and probe of 5 mm BFO (smart probe ATMA). MS data were colledted on a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF-Q II-ESITOF mass spectrometer. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum silica 60 F254 (Merck) and used to monitor isolation. Compounds were visualized by exposure under UV254/366 light and by spraying with H2SO4/vanillin solution. Chromatographic separations were performed on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230−700 mesh), Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB), and C18 (Luna). Plant Materials. The stems of Metrodorea stipularis were collected in July 2010 at the Agronomic Institute in Campinas, SP; the authentication was made by Luiz Carlos Bernacci. A voucher specimen (44005) was deposited at the same Institute. Journal of Natural Products Article dx.doi.org/10.1021/np500453x | J. Nat. Prod. XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B Extraction and Isolation. The stems were dried and macerated with EtOH for 3 days. The solvent was removed using reduced pressure at 40 °C, aﬀording 30 g of a species. This extract was subjected to liquid−liquid partitioning to yield hexanes (2 g), CH2Cl2 (4 g), EtOAc (11 g), and hydroalcoholic (13 g) fractions. All were submitted to enzymatic assay against cruzain, and the CH2Cl2 fraction showed signiﬁcant inhibition of the enzyme; thus it was chromato- graphed over silica gel 60 (φ = 5.0 cm × h = 22.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (10:0, 15:5, 5:5, 0:10) to yield 24 fractions (MSD1− MSD24). Fraction MSD15 (170 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 10 subfractions (MSD15_1− MSD15_10). Subfraction MSD15_7 (10 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 30.0 cm) eluting with MeOH to obtain 1 (2 mg). Fraction MSD21 (400 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 3.0 cm × h = 23.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2/EtOAc (9:1) to give eight subfractions (MSD21_1−MSD21_8). Subfraction MSD21_8 (50 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH to give 20 subfractions (MSD21_8_1−MSD21_8_20). Subfraction MSD21_8_12 (20 mg) was chromatographed over silica gel 60 (φ = 2.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) eluting with CH2Cl2 to obtain 2 (2 mg) and 3 (8 mg). Subfraction MSD21_8_19 (9 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase preparative HPLC (C18 Luna, φ = 1.0 cm × h = 25.0 cm) using MeOH/ACN/H2O (4:1:5) as mobile phase and a ﬂow of 3.5 mL/min to aﬀord 4 (2.5 mg). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethyl- chroman-6-yl)propan-1-one (2): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2066 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-[4-hydroxy-3-(3- methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl]propan-1-one (3): amorphous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 1; ESITOFMS m/z 410.2040 (calcd for C25H30O5 m/z 410.2094). 1-(5,7-Dihydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-6-yl)-3-(1,1,4a-trimethyl- 2,3,4,4a, 9a-hexahydro-1H-xanthen-7-yl)propan-1-one (4): amor- phous powder; NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d6) see Table 2; ESITOFMS m/z 478.2714 (calcd for C30H38O5 m/z 478.2720). Enzyme Inhibition Assays. Cruzain. All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F2500 spectroﬂuorimeter. Inhibitory activity was measured by the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanylarginine-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide). The enzyme activity was tracked for 5 min, with stirring, in phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.3) with 5 μL of DTT at 37 °C after addition of 2 μL of the substrate. The experiments were carried out in triplicate in quartz cuvettes, and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 1 mL (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). IC50 values were determined by rate measurements with ﬁve inhibitor concentrations. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the program GraFit 5. Cathepsins.

Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic ﬂuorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and a concentration of 185 μM for catB and 10 μM for catL. The enzyme was activated for 5 min with DTT and acetate buﬀer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 200 μL, kept under stirring (excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control).

Bioassay of Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth. The strains 3D7, W2, and Dd2 of P. falciparum malaria parasites (BEI Resources, MR4/ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in human type O+ erythrocytes in complete medium (RPMI 1640 (Cellgro), 0.043 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), 0.014 mg/mL hypoxanthine (Acros), 38.5 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.18% NaHCO3 (Cellgro), 0.20% Glucose (MP Biomedical), 0.003 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.2% Albumax (Gibco), 5% human serum) as previously described.14 Brieﬂy, cultures were maintained in 25 cm3 ﬂasks (Corning) at a volume of 10 mL and were gassed for 30 s with an environment of 3% CO2, 1% O2, and 96% N2, then incubated at 37 °C. The antimalarial activity was determined with a SYBR Green based parasite proliferation assay, adapted from Smilkstein15 and Bennett.16 Using this technique, the increase of parasite DNA contained in human red blood cells was measured after 72 h of incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of compounds.17 Relative ﬂuorescence values were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM ﬂuorimeter (excitation 495 nm and emission 525 nm).

After decades of intensive searching for antimicrobial compounds derived from actinobacteria, the frequency of isolation of new molecules has decreased. To cope with this concern, studies have focused on the exploitation of actinobacteria from unexplored environments and actinobacteria symbionts of plants and animals. In this study, twenty-four actinobacteria strains isolated from workers of Trachymyrmex ants were evaluated for antifungal activity towards a variety of Candida species. Results revealed that seven strains inhibited the tested Candida species. Streptomyces sp. TD025 presented potent and broad spectrum of inhibition of Candida and was selected for the isolation of bioactive molecules. From liquid shake culture of this bacterium, we isolated the rare antimycin urauchimycins A and B. For the first time, these molecules were evaluated for antifungal activity against medically important Candida species. Both antimycins showed antifungal activity, especially urauchimycin B. This compound inhibited the growth of all Candida species tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin. Our results concur with the predictions that the attine ant-microbe symbiosis may be a source of bioactive metabolites for biotechnology and medical applications. 1. Introduction The increased resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics is a problem of public health [1]. The increasing number of fungal species that can infect humans, particularly immunocompro- mised individuals, further reinforces this concern. A limited number of antifungal agents are commercially available when compared to antibacterial drugs. This scenario motivates the search for new bioactive compounds in various biological systems using several approaches, including metagenomics and microbial genome-mining. Actinobacteria are widely known for their ability to pro- duce bioactive secondary metabolites, especially compounds with antimicrobial activity. These bacteria are responsible for producing two-thirds of the commercially available antibi- otics [2, 3]. Most actinobacteria species explored commer- cially were isolated from the soil. However, after decades of bioprospecting actinobacteria from this environment, it is becoming more difficult to obtain strains producing novel bioactive metabolites [4]. Thus, many companies have turned the search for microbial producers of novel antifungal com- pounds to other environments such as hydrothermal vents, 2 BioMed Research International marine environments, tropical rain forests, and microbial symbionts associated with plants and animals hosts [5, 6]. For example, the occurrence of actinobacteria associated with marine sponges and the fact that such strains produce com- pounds with antimicrobial activity confirms this potential [7– 9]. In addition, endophytic actinobacteria are also explored for their capacity to produce antimicrobial compounds [10– 12]. Several studies have focused on the association between actinobacteria and insects from an ecological perspective [13–25]. On the other hand, few studies have focused on the multitude of chemical compounds that are involved in such interactions [26]. The best studied example is the symbiosis between actinobacteria and fungus-growing ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: tribe Attini). In this association, the actinobacteria are found on the ants’ integument and produce antimicrobial compounds that help the ants to suppress the microfungus Escovopsis sp. [13, 14]. This fungus is considered a specialized parasite of the ant cultivar and causes negative impacts to the ant colony [27]. Actinobacteria isolated from the integument of attine ants are generally classified in the genus Pseudonocardia and Streptomyces. Bioactive molecules have already been isolated and characterized from actinobacteria isolated from several attine genera [26]. Pseudonocardia isolated from Acromyrmex octospinosus and Apterostigma dentigerum are known to pro- duce several compounds like (i) dentigerumycin, a complex compound active against Candida albicans and Escovopsis [28]; (ii) a nystatin-like antifungal [29]; (iii) the novel quinone pseudonocardones A–C active against the malaria causal agent Plasmodium berghei [30]; (iv) the already known antibi- otics 6-deoxy-8-O-methylrabelomycin and X-14 881, both active against Bacillus subtilis and P. berghei [30]. In addition to Pseudonocardia, actinobacteria in the genus Streptomyces are also found on the integument of Acromyrmex workers and were shown to produce (i) candicidin, active against Escovopsis sp. [29, 31–34], (ii) antimycins active against Escovopsis sp. [32–34], and (iii) actinomycin D, actinomycin X2 and valinomycin that are active against B. subtilis [32]. Poulsen [35] suggested that the attine ant-microbe asso- ciation is little explored regarding the search for new antimicrobials. The author highlights the various symbiotic associations between attine ants and microorganisms as a promising source for drug discovery, especially those with antimicrobial activity. Here, we explored the antimicrobial potential of actinobacteria isolated from the integument of Trachymyrmex fungus-growing ants and demonstrate the action against different medically important Candida species. We also report two previously described urauchimycins from a Streptomyces strain and emphasize the newly discovered anti-Candida activity of these compounds. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification. Twelve Trachymyrmex colonies were collected in different Brazilian biomes (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/835081). Colonies were carefully excavated in order to reach the first fungus garden chamber. Fungus garden with the tending workers and brood was sampled using an alcohol-flamed spoon and stored in sterile plastic containers. All containers were kept in a cooler during transport to the laboratory where they were maintained at 25∘C. From each colony, we randomly selected four workers for actinobacteria isolation. Then, the propleural plates were scraped with a sterile needle under a low power stereomicroscope. All ants used in the present study had a visible, whitish covering on the propleural plates. Scrapings were plated on SCN agar (in g ⋅L−1: 10.0 starch, 0.3 casein, 2.0 KNO3, 2.0 NaCl, 2.0 K2HPO4, 0.05 MgSO4 ⋅7 H2O, 0.02 CaCO3, 0.01 FeSO4 ⋅7H2O and 18.0 agar supplemented with 0.05 Nystatin) [36]. After scraping, the entire body of all workers was inoculated on SCN agar. All plates were incubated at 25∘C for 30 days. From each sampled Trachymyrmex colony, one representative strain was selected from each morphotype obtained. The strains were subcultured in YMA (in g ⋅L−1: 3.0 yeast extract, 3.0 malt extract, 5.0 peptone, 10.0 glucose, 18.0 agar) and stored at −80∘C in 15% glycerol. We used a molecular approach to provide taxonomic affiliation to actinobacteria strains. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method of Sampaio et al. [37]. We carried out 16S rDNA PCR with the universal primers 27F (5-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-3) and 1492R (5- TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3) [38]. Reactions were conducted in a final volume of 25 𝜇L and contained 1 𝜇L of diluted DNA template (1 : 10), 2.0 𝜇L of each primer (10 mM), 2.5 𝜇L of 10X buffer, 1.0 𝜇L of MgCl2 (50 mM), 4.0 𝜇L of dNTPs (1.25 mM each), 0.2 𝜇L of Taq polymerase (5 U/𝜇L), and 12.3 𝜇L of ultrapure water. Amplicons were cleaned up with GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purifica- tion Kit (GE Healthcare). Forward and reverse sequences were generated using the same primers, along with an internal primer U519F (5-CAGCMGCCGCGGTAATWC- 3). Sequences were generated using BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies) in an ABI 3130 sequencer and manually edited in BioEdit v. 7.1.3 [39]. Contigs were compared with those available in the databases NCBI- GenBank (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Ribossomal Database Project (RDP, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). Sequences generated in the present study were deposited in NCBI- GenBank (accessions KC480554-KC480557). A phylogenetic analysis was carried out in order to deter- mine the taxonomic affiliation of strain TD025. Sequences of closest relatives were retrieved from the NCBI-GenBank and the RDP Project and aligned in ClustalW. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in PAUP v. 4.0 [40]. Genetic dis- tances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model of nucleotide substitution [41]. Robustness of the relation- ships was estimated from 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. 2.2. Organic Extracts and Antifungal Assays. All actinobac- teria were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 50 mL of modified MPE medium (in g ⋅L−1: 5.0 soy flour, BioMed Research International 3 20.0 glucose, 5.0 of NaCl, 4.0 CaCO3) [42]. Each flask was inoculated with five mycelium disks (1 cm in diameter) cut from a previously grown culture and then incubated at 28∘C for two days on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. From this culture, 10 mL was inoculated in two Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 100 mL of the same medium and incu- bated for five days on the same conditions. After incubation, the fermented broth was separated from the mycelium by centrifugation and partitioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the EtOAc extracts were diluted in RPMI-1640 culture broth containing 10% DMSO and used in the antimicrobial assays. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evalu- ated against the yeasts Candida albicans CBS 562, Candida dubliniensis CBS 7987, Candida glabrata CBS 138, Candida krusei CBS 573, Candida parapsilosis CBS 604, and Candida tropicalis CBS 94. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the microdilution method according to the M27-A2 standard of the Clinical and Lab- oratory Standards Institute [43]. 2.3. Isolation and Characterization of the Bioactive Com- pounds of Strain TD025. The actinobacteria strain that exhib- ited both a broad antifungal spectrum and lower MIC values was strain TD025. In order to identify the compounds responsible for the observed results, the strain was cultured in 5 L of modified MPE medium and the extracts were obtained as described. The fermented broth (5 L) was separated from the cells by centrifugation and portioned three times with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The crude extract, a dark green oil (1.40 g), was separated by means of column chromatography using silica gel 60 eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc as the elution gradient, yielding 8 fractions. All fractions were submitted to antimicrobial assays against C. albicans following the procedure described above. The most active fraction (67.5 mg) was subjected to preparative TLC (thin layer chromatography) eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7 : 3) two times, yielding 3 subfractions. The subfractions obtained were submitted to antimicrobial assays against C. albicans. The most active subfraction was submitted to semipreparative HPLC separations carried out in a Shimadzu (LC-6AD apparatus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP). The separation was carried out using VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18 column eluted with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50 : 50 : 0.01) at a flow rate of 3 mL ⋅min−1, yielding com- pounds 1 and 2. The isolated molecules were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic experiments recorded on a BRUKER DRX-400 spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard. 2.4. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Fungi- cide Concentration of Bioactive Compounds. After isola- tion and determination of the structure of the targeted compounds, they were evaluated for antimicrobial activity following the method described previously. Besides the MIC determination, we also evaluated the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The MFC was determined by inoculat- ing Sabouraud dextrose medium with 10 𝜇L of the contents of each of the wells where there was growth inhibition of yeast, the MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of the substance capable of preventing the onset of colony forming units. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Actinobacteria Isolation and Identification. Several acti- nobacteria colonies were observed after incubation of iso- lation plates. We selected just one morphotype of each per ant colony, rendering a total of 24 strains ouf of 12 Tra- chymyrmex spp. nests (Table S1). Four actinobacteria genera were identified and Streptomyces was the most abundant taxon (Table 1), corresponding to 66.67% of the strains. It is assumed that the main actinobacteria associated with the integument of attine workers is the genus Pseudonocardia [14–16, 20]. However, several authors have demonstrated the isolation of actinobacteria other than Pseudonocardia on the integument of attine ants [17–19, 21, 22, 29, 31]. The prevalence of Streptomyces and absence of Pseudonocardia among our isolates may be due to the culture medium used [44]. The SCN medium is suitable for the isolation of fast-growing actinobacteria, but according to other authors [13–16], the use of a low-nutrient medium, such as chitin agar, may provide the recovery of Pseudonocardia strains. In eight out of 12 ant colonies, we obtained more than one actinobacteria morphotype (Table S1). From colony CTL080820-02, the two morphotypes isolated from two different workers were identified as the same actinobacteria species (Tables S1 and 1). On the other hand, different actinobacteria species were isolated in the seven remaining colonies. We also observed the occurrence of different acti- nobacteria strains in a single worker (Tables S1 and 1). This result demonstrates the diversity of actinobacteria present on the integument of these ants (Table S1, nests SES080911-04 and SES080924-01). The 16S rDNA sequence of strain TD025 showed 99% similarity with sequences of several species of the genus Streptomyces deposited in the databases. For a better charac- terization, we performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). The result suggests a differentiated phylogenetic position for strain TD025 when compared with the remaining sequences. This preliminary analysis allowed us to assign this strain as belonging to the genus Streptomyces, with S. cirratus as the closest relative strain (Figure 1). However, more refined phylogenetic analyses, along with morphological and physi- ological studies, are necessary to ensure the identification of TD025 to the species level. 3.2. Screening for Antifungal Activity. Our screening for antifungal activity revealed that seven out of 24 extracts (29.16%) inhibited the growth of at least one Candida species. C. albicans was the most sensitive yeast and was 4 BioMed Research International Table 1: Actinobacteria identification according to 16S rDNA sequencing.

The yeasts C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were the most resistant strains, being inhibited by one and two actinobacteria extracts, respectively, with MIC values of 1000 𝜇g ⋅mL−1 (Table 2). Except for strain TD034 identified as Amycolatopsis decaplanina (Table 1), the other actinobacteria exhibiting antimicrobial activity were identified as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. This genus is recognized as the largest producer of antibiotics because from approximately 3,000 known antibiotics obtained from actinobacteria, the genus Streptomyces contributes with 90% of this total [45]. The extracts of Streptomyces sp. TD025 and Streptomyces crystallinus TD027 showed activity against all yeast strains except for C. glabrata. These extracts were effective against C. albicans and C. krusei and showed low activity against C. tropicalis (Table 2). More interestingly, both strains were isolated from the same colony but from independent workers (Table 1). Because lower MICs were obtained for the extract of Streptomyces sp. TD025, this strain was selected to verify the chemical compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity. 3.3. Bioactive Compounds of Streptomyces sp. TD025. Chro- matographic procedures revealed that EtOAc extract from TD025 contains two compounds (1 and 2, Figure 2). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited typical NMR data of urauchimycins (Figures S1 and S2). Their NMR data are in agreement with those previously reported by Imamura et al. [46]. Although these urauchimycins (1 and 2) have already been isolated, they have never been tested on various species of Candida as carried out in the present study. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 22 carbon signals: four carbonyls (𝛿179.0, 𝛿170.6, 𝛿169.8, and 𝛿158.7), three quaternary sp2 carbons (𝛿150.6, 𝛿127.4, and 𝛿112.8), three methine aromatic carbons (𝛿124.8, 𝛿120.6, and 𝛿119.0), two sp3 methylene group (𝛿35.6 and 𝛿30.5), three sp3 methine groups (𝛿54.0, 𝛿50.1, and 𝛿32.4), three oxymethinic groups (𝛿77.1, 𝛿76.3, and 𝛿70.9), and four methyl groups (𝛿18.4, 𝛿18.4, 𝛿15.1, and 𝛿11.4). Two carboxylic carbons 𝛿170.6 and 𝛿173.9 showed correlations with different hydrogens of the structure, showing a dilactone system of nine members, typical of the antimycin class. The 1H NMR spectrum showed a singlet at 𝛿8.50, assigned to a hydrogen bounded to a carbonyl group and three aromatic hydrogens at 𝛿8.55 (dd, J 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), 𝛿7.24 (dd, J 8.1 and 1.2 Hz), and d 6.92 (t, J 8.1 Hz), suggesting a 1,2,3 trisubstituted aromatic ring. The substance was identified as urauchimycin A by comparison with the literature data [46]. The 1H and 13C NMR spectram of 2 were very similar to those observed for compound 1. Differences were observed in chemical shifts of the hydrogen of the methyl and methylene BioMed Research International 5 100 73 65 74 98 100 100 86 58 58 68 71 0.001 Streptomyces sp.

Urauchimycins belong to the antimycin class, a group of well-known antifungals. Antimycins act by inhibiting the electron flow in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [47]. Antimycins have been previously identified in Streptomyces isolated from the integument of attine ants [32–34]. Schoe- nian and colleagues [32] detected the well-know antimycins A1–A4 in 50% of the actinobacteria identified as Streptomyces isolated from workers of several Acromyrmex species. These data along with the rare antimycins identified in the present study indicate that this chemical class is often produced by Streptomyces associated with attine ants. Compounds belonging to this class may have an important role in the attine ant-microbe association. Another antifungal compound widely distributed in Streptomyces associated with attine ants is candicidin [31–34], which was not detected in Streptomyces sp. TD025. It is possible that candicidin was lost in one of the purification steps of the AcOEt extract or it is not produced by this strain. Urauchimycins A and B were previously isolated from Streptomyces sp. Ni-80 isolated from a marine sponge in Urauchicove, Irimore, Japan. These substances were the first antimycins having an odd number of carbons and a branching side chain [46]. Imamura et al. [46] suggested that such structures are the result of an evolution of actinobacteria in the marine environment, which could have resulted in a change in their secondary metabolism. In 2006, two new urauchimycins were described: urau- chimycin C, isolated from Streptomyces sp. B1751 from marine sediment, and urauchimycin D, isolated from Streptomyces sp. AdM21 from soil [48]. In the study by Imamura and coworkers [46], the urauchimycins A and B inhibited the morphological differentiation of C. albicans up to a con- centration of 10 𝜇g ⋅mL−1. Urauchimycins C and D showed no inhibitory activity against C. albicans, Mucor miehei, and bacteria [48]. The study of antimicrobial activity of urauchimycins A and B was restricted to C. albicans in the work by Imamura and colleagues [46]. The reisolation of these molecules in the present study allowed a better evaluation of its spectrum of 6 BioMed Research International Table 2: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (𝜇g⋅mL−1) of actinobacteria extracts towards different medically important Candida species.

The urauchimycins from Streptomyces sp. TD025 pre- sented MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nys- tatin for C. albicans and C. glabrata (Table 3). Urauchimycin B showed inhibitory activity against all Candida strains eval- uated, showing MIC similar to those provided by nystatin. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity against Candida spp. with MIC values equivalent to the antifungal nystatin, which indicates the potential for medical use. For many years, antimycins were used for the treatment of human infections, but due to its mechanism of action and associated side effects, its use in human treatment was discontinued [47]. However, with the pressing need for new antifungal agents that complement or substitute for the scarce products available on the market, it is interesting and nec- essary to determine the toxicity presented by urauchimycin B, to assess whether it can be used as an antifungal agent for humans and animals. In addition, evaluation of the isolated compound against Candida species resistant to commercially available antifungal agents should be performed to confirm the potential of this relatively unexplored antifungal. Here we show that Trachymyrmex ants, one attine genus understudied with respect to its microbial symbionts, har- bor antimicrobial-producing actinobacteria. As observed by other authors [28–33], the present study demonstrates that BioMed Research International 7 Table 3: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicide concentrations (MFC) (𝜇g⋅mL−1) of Urauchimycins A and B obtained from Streptomyces sp.

Moreover, our study corroborates previous work [35] that suggests the attine ant-microbe association is a promising source of microorganisms that produce active metabolites. The few recent studies that focused on the chemical charac- terization of bioactive compounds produced by actinobacte- ria associated with attine ants support the potential isolation of novel molecules with biological activity [28–32]. Thus, an exploration program of isolation of bioactive molecules from actinobacteria from attine ants certainly will result in the discovery of novel compounds with activity against microorganisms that are potentially pathogenic to humans. 4. Conclusion As suggested by Poulsen [35], we found that the integument of Trachymrymex ants is a potential source for the isolation of actinobacteria that produce bioactive molecules. The isola- tion of Urauchimycins A and B enabled, for the first time, the evaluation of their activity against various Candida species. Urauchimycin B showed a broad spectrum of activity and MIC values equivalent to the reference antifungal nystatin. Toxicity studies and in vivo activity should be carried out in order to verify the potential use of this molecule in the treatment of fungal infections.

In this context, some enzymes such as cyclooxygenases, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) have been widely rec- ognized as powerful targets for the action of anti-inﬂamma- tory agents.1—3) MPO is a leukocyte-derived heme peroxi- dase which has long been considered as a microbial enzyme centrally linked to the unspeciﬁc immune defense system. MPO plays an important role in oxidants production by poly- morphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). It uses hydrogen perox- ide (H2O2) and chloride gas to catalyze the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which contributes to both micro- bial killing, and subsequent oxidative injury of host tissue triggering severe inﬂammatory disorders,4) including rheuma- toid arthritis,5) inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD),6) cystic ﬁbrosis,7) neonatal lung injury,8) and adult respiratory distress syndrome.9) Thus, the search for new MPO inhibitors from natural sources can provide prototypes for the anti-inﬂamma- tory drug discovery, and design of novel therapeutic strate- gies. Pterogyne nitens TULASNE (Fabaceae) popularly known as “cocal”, “yvira-ró”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” is a highly branched and ca. 5—12 m high tree.10) Its wood is used for house building, for furniture and to make bows.11) In folk medicine, stem barks have been used as antiparasitic agent e.g., for treatment of ascariasis.12) As previously reported, the leaves of P. nitens yielded ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which ex- hibited cytotoxic activity against the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against to CHO Aux B1 cells.13) Preliminary study on additional bio- logical activities of P. nitens indicated a strong inhibition of rat paw edema suggesting the presence of anti-inﬂammatory compounds in its leaves EtOH extract which prompted us to investigate its chemical composition and evaluate the antioxi- dant and MPO inhibitory properties of the isolates. Experimental Plant Material Leaves of Pterogyne nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher speci- men (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Insti- tute (SP, Brazil). Isolation and Puriﬁcation The shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (1.8 l3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with ethanol (2.7 l3) at room temper- ature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-butanol. After solvent removal using a rotaevaporator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1—E11). Chromatographic puriﬁcation of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (46 : 53.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 10 ml/min] led to the isolation of compounds 1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (55 : 44.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 13 ml/min], afford- ing compound 3 (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identiﬁcation as compound 5 (130 mg). The butanol frac- tion (1.8 g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1—B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4—B6 were combined (333 mg) and pu- riﬁed by RP-HPLC (MeOH : H2O : AcOH (68 : 31.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm and ﬂow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds 2 (66 mg) and 4 (89 mg). Radical Scavenging Activity (RSA) Antioxidant activity of com- pounds 1—6 was determined using DPPH· (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS· [2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as- reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1—6 and positive controls at various con- centrations (33.3—1.7 mM) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 mM DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS· was pre- pared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mM) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1 : 0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12—16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS· stock solution was diluted with KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1 : 10 before use) buffer solution (ratio 1 : 88). ABTS· solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds 1—6 and positive controls (0.5—7.0 mg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical May 2008 723 Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory and Radical Scavenging Activities of Flavones from Pterogyne nitens Daniara Cristina FERNANDES,a Luis Octávio REGASINI,a José Carlos Rebuglio VELLOSA,b Patrícia Mendonça PAULETTI,a Ian CASTRO-GAMBOA,a Vanderlan Silva BOLZANI,a Olga Maria Mascarenhas OLIVEIRA,b and Dulce Helena Siqueira SILVA*,a a NuBBE-Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Department of Organic Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil: and b Department of Biochemistry and Chemical Technology, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil. Received December 22, 2007; accepted February 12, 2008; published online February 18, 2008 Two new ﬂavone glucosides, nitensosides A and B (1, 2), together with four known compounds, sorbifolin (3), sorbifolin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (4), pedalitin (5), and pedalitin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (6) were isolated from Pterogyne nitens. Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolu- tion mass spectrometry. All the isolated ﬂavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory ac- tivity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nM on MPO. Additionally, the radical- scavenging capacity of ﬂavones 1—6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox®.

Anti-radical abilities against ABTS· and DPPH· species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition[1(Asample/A)100], where A is test absorbance without sam- ple (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with com- pounds 1—6 or positive controls. Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity Inhibitory effects of 7-me- thoxyﬂavones 1—6 on MPO were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample con- centrations of compounds 1—6 (0.50—50 nM) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibi- tion expressed in concentration-response curves. Results and Discussion Nitensoside A (1) was obtained as yellow amorphous pow- der. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (a,b-unsaturated CO), 1606, 1502, 1452 (CC, aro- matic), and a broad band at 1160 cm1, indicating the pres- ence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These re- sults strongly suggested that compound 1 is a ﬂavonoid gly- coside.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two anomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at d 4.92 (1H, d, J7.0 Hz, H-1), d 4.45 (1H, d, J1.5 Hz, H-1), d 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a), d 3.70 (1H, dd, J10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b), and d 1.04 (1H, d, J6.0 Hz, H-6) suggested the presence of one b-glucopyranosyl and one a-rhamnopyranosyl unit in compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at d 102.4 (C-1), d 100.6 (C-1), d 66.6 (C-6) and d 17.7 (C-6). In the aromatic moiety of compound 1, signals at d 7.96 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-2, 6), 6.94 (2H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-3, 5), 6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4-trihydroxy- ﬂavone).17,19) The singlet at d 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the ﬂavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR res- onance at d 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton signal at d 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.90, which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at d 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations conﬁrmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4-trihydroxy-7-methoxyﬂavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolinH] ion at m/z 301 observed in ﬁrst-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound 1.

Assignment of the inner sugar res- onances was achieved by using the anomeric proton reso- nance at d 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of 1H–1H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (J7.0 Hz) conﬁrmed the b-linkage of the ﬁrst glucosyl moiety. The downﬁeld shift of C-6 (5.5 ppm) and upﬁeld shift of C-5 (1.4 ppm) glucopyra- nosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin- 6-O-b-glucopyranoside,19) indicated that the rhamnopyra- nosyl moiety was attached at C-6. Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at d 100.6 (C-1) and d 3.70 (H-6) conﬁrmed the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage of compound 1. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound 1 showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [MH] at 607.1657 m/z, in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C28H31O15 (607.1657). Compound 2 was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 623.1600 (Calcd 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C28H31O16. The UV and IR spectra of 2 were similar to those of compound 1 suggesting a 6-O- glucosylﬂavone derivative. The IR of 2 showed a broad hy- droxyl band at 3427 cm1, and an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm1, in addition to a C–O stretching band at 1045 cm1, indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of 2 exhibited absorption maxima typical of a ﬂavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The 1H- and 13C-NMR data (Table 1) suggested that compound 2 had the same 7- methoxyﬂavone skeleton as compound 1, except for the pres- ence of a hydroxy group at C-3. In fact, the major difference between compounds 1 and 2 was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at d 7.42 (1H, dd, J8.5, 2.0 Hz, H-6), d 7.50 (1H, d, J2.0 Hz, H-2), and d 6.88 (1H, d, J8.5 Hz, H-5) for compound 2. The 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 2 presented 28 signals, deduced from distor- tionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90°, DEPT 135° and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, ﬁfteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quater- nary carbons, including one a,b-unsaturated ketone at d 182.1, which conﬁrmed the ﬂavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC cor- relation of signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.88 (OMe) in addition to NOESY interaction of signals at d 3.88 and d 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at d 128.0 (C-6) and d 4.89 (H-1), and between signals at d 66.5 (C-6) and d 4.43 (H-1) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6–O–C-1 interglycosidic linkage in compound 2. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures of ﬂavones 1 and 2 were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-O-a- rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl(1→6)-b-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyﬂavones were isolated and identiﬁed as sorbifolin (3),20) sorbifolin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (4),20) pedalitin (5),20) and pedalitin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (6).13) The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay.14,15) Pedalitin deriva- tives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin de- rivatives, probably due to presence of the ortho-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity.21,22) Pedalitin deriva- tives 2, 5 and 6 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC50 (mM) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC50 values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives 1, 3 and 4 (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the cathecol moi- ety on the B-ring of ﬂavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin de- rivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (5) when compared to its glucosides 2 and 6 in both assays, evi- dencing the inﬂuence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and there- fore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference com- pound quercetin (IC50 4.12 mM), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones.23) Similarly, this trend has also been ob- served for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC50 (5.7 mM to- wards ABTS, and 13.5 mM towards DPPH) than its 6-O-glu- cosyl derivatives 1 and 4, thus conﬁrming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi- calar activity of 7-methoxyﬂavones. Although a broad spectrum of the effects on mam- malian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids,24) few studies have been devoted to the MPO in- hibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols.25,26) MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modiﬁcations.16) The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds 2, 5 and 6, displaying a 3,4-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC50 values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1, 3 and 4, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohy- droxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides 1, 2, 4 and 6 showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between May 2008 725 Fig. 2. Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds 1 and 2 MPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inﬂammation derived diseases. Conclusion The association of antiradicalar properties and MPO in- hibitory activity observed for ﬂavones 1—6, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated ﬂavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inﬂammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme in- volved in inﬂammatory processes.

The structures of these compounds were determined mainly based on spectral analysis. The only known spirorotenoid described in the literature is amor- phispironone, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa. Introduction The genus Tephrosia belongs to the family Faba- ceae, which is well-known to be a rich source of flavonoids, besides the rotenoids among their sec- ondary metabolites. Rotenoids, an interesting class of compounds showing mainly activity against in- sects, have also shown powerful ictiotoxic activity, fish poison. Rotenone was the first rotenoid iden- tified and had been used as insecticide before the advent of the organosynthetic insecticides (Jacob- son, 1971). Recently, properties as anticarcino- genic activities have also been attributed to rote- noids. Tephrosin and amorphispironone (1) isolated from Amorpha species have shown a potential use against tumours including skin cancer (Konoshima et al., 1993 and Li et al., 1993). We have been interested in the chemistry of T. candida and have described the isolation of ro- tenoids from this plant (Andrei et al., 1997 and Pereira et al.,1998). In continuation of the study of the roots of T. candida we now describe the isola- tion and identification of three spirorotenoids, which represent a new spiroclass system formed by the rings B and C, a different spiro system type of amorphispironone, the only known spirorote- noid (Li et al.,1991). Materials and Methods General experimental procedures A Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C NMR 0939Ð5075/2002/0500Ð0418 $ 06.00 ” 2002 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen · www.znaturforsch.com · D was used. All spectra were run in CDCl3 and with TMS as internal standard. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter. Mass spectra were obtained with a HP 5987A spectrom- eter. Plant material Roots of T. candida (Roxb.) DC were collected and identified in the Instituto Agronoˆmico do Par- ana´, PR, Brazil, January 1988. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herba´rio of Instituto Agro- noˆmico, Londrina, PR, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of compounds The roots were dried in an open stove at 60 ∞C and powdered affording 2.7 kg.

Results and Discussion The infrared spectra showed absorption of car- bonyls at 1681, 1748 and 1675 cmÐ1, and 1716 cmÐ1 for 2 and 3 respectively. The absorption 1748 cmÐ1 was attributed to a carbonyl of an α,-dihydro-δ- lactone ring and the one 1716 cmÐ1 to the α,- dehydro-cyclopentanone, while absorptions close to 1680 cmÐ1, are usually observed for carbonyls of 6a, 12a-dihydrorotenoids The 1H NMR of the three compounds displayed an AB coupling system for two geminal hydro- gens, neighbouring the quaternary carbon of the Table I. 1H NMR data for spirocompounds (CDCl3, 400 MHz).

This system has never been observed before for any rotenoids. Other signals showed to be characteristic of hydrogens in the rings A, D and E, exhibiting differences of the chemical shifts, in comparison with deguelin (5) (Andrei et al. 1997) and rotenone (6) (Birch et al. 1985) as models. The chemical shifts observed for H-1 and H-4 in the ring A (Table I) exhibited ac- centuated differences indicating the presence of an electron withdrawing substituent at the aromatic system. The hydrogens in the D and E rings showed closer chemical shifts when compared with those of the above deguelin and rotenone. The pair of doublets attributed to H-6 in the spirocom- pounds showed similar chemical shifts with those of the homoisoflavanone scillascillin (7). The di- astereotopic protons of this compound (H-2) ap- pear as an AB system, displayed at δ 4.52 and 4.62 (J = 11.0 Hz) (Heller and Tamm, 1981). The 13C NMR chemical shifts were attributed to the carbons of compounds 1, 2 and 3, having rotenone (6) (Crombie et al., 1975) and deguelin (5) (Andrei et al.,1997) as models (Table II). The chemical shifts of C-6a and the additional carbonyl in C-12a of the new compounds have never been described for common rotenoid skeleta before. The data of Table II are in agreement with the proposed structures.

The HMBC spectrum of tephrospirolactone (2)(Table III) showed cross peaks between hy- drogens and carbons (2J and 3J) that confirmed the proposed structure.

Mass spectrum of 3, also presented the base peak due to the only one retro Diels-Alder type fragmentation. Rotenoid biosynthesis is already well-known (Crombie, 1984 and Crombie and Whitting, 1998). These two last reviews show the main biosynthetic pathways. The biosynthetic pathway for amorphi- spironone 1, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa (Li et al., 1991; Terada et al.,1993) was discussed by Li (1991), and also mentioned by Crombie (1998). For the spiroketones 3 and 4, a similar first step mechanism with an epoxidation, like in amorphi- spironone, can be suggested. Therefore, the start- ing compound should be the 6a,12a-dehydrode- guelin. The epoxidation should occur between C-6a and C-12a. In a hydrate form at C-12 car- bonyl, a pinacol-pinacolone type rearrangement could lead to the spiro compounds, after intercon- version to the carbonylated form and oxidation of C-12a into a keto group. Subsequent oxidation by a Baeyer-Villiger reaction type at C-12 and expan- sion to a six membered lactone ring could explain the formation of the spirolactone 2.

Berg (Myrtaceae) were screened for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypano- soma cruzi and T. brucei, as well as for their enzymatic inhibitory activities on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and trypanothione reductase (TR) enzymes from T. cruzi and adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) enzyme from Leish- mania tarentolae. In general, polar extracts displayed strong effects and some of the tested compounds have shown good results in comparison to positive controls of the bioassays. Key words: Myrtaceae, Trypanosoma, Leishmania Introduction Siphoneugena densiflora O. Berg commonly known as Uvatinga belongs to the family Myrta- ceae and occurs in grasslands (“campos rupes- tres”), deciduous forests (“cerrado˜es”) and gallery forests in Goia´s, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Sa˜o Paulo States of Brazil. This plant takes part in a genus comprising only nine species; two of them are vulnerable to extinction in Sa˜o Paulo State (Programa Biota FAPESP, 2007) and one species, S. delicata, has been recently described (Sobral and Proenc¸a, 2006). S. densiflora has been biologically and chemically researched by our group (Gallo et al., 2006a, b, c) since neither data about it could be found in the literature nor popu- lar use has been registered. Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae, formely Verbenaceae) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espı´rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro 0939Ð5075/2008/0500Ð0371 $ 06.00 ” 2008 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen · http://www.znaturforsch.com · D and Sa˜o Paulo, and is commonly called “Taruma˜”. Its leaf tea is used in folk medicine to treat kidney infections (Rodrigues, 2001; Gallo et al., 2008). Several of its compounds had already been charac- terized and bioassayed (Leita˜o et al., 1997; Leita˜o and Delle Monache, 1998; Santos et al., 2001; Men- sor et al., 2001), but none was regarded as neither potential trypanocidal nor enzyme inhibitor. Trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a compli- cated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoal agents. Trypanosomatids have no functional tricarbox- ylic acid cycle, and their bloodstream forms are highly dependent on glycolysis to the stage of pyr- uvate as sole energy supply. Trypanosome glycoly- Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM 372 M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants sis occurs in a specific microbody called glyco- some. Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy neces- sary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy- drogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of Trypanosoma cruzi catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphor- ylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bis- phosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD+ and in- organic phosphate. The in silico modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker et al., 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spermi- dine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb et al., 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the N1,N8-(bisglutathionyl)- spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S]2) to di- hydrotrypanothione (T[SH]2). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S]2) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against try- panosomatids (Hamilton et al., 2003). The genus Leishmania owns three enzymes in- volved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephos- phoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and α-d-5- phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into ad- enosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophos- phate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofura- nose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid se- quence when compared to corresponding mam- malian enzymes, which should allow the develop- ment of selective inhibitor compounds. In our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from T. cruzi or APRT enzyme from Leishmania tarentolae, were assessed.

T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activity The enzymatic activity of T. cruzi gGAPDH and the inhibitory activities of extracts and compounds against this enzyme have been determined accord- Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 375 ing to an earlier reported procedure (Vieira et al., 2001). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), i.e., the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentra- tions, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC50 = 55.5 μm). L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activity APRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier de- scribed procedures (Thiemann et al., 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectro- photometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propane- diol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 μL APRT so- lution. The reaction started by the addition of en- zyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira et al., 2001). T. cruzi TR inhibitory activity Enzyme activity and assay were performed ac- cording to prior descriptions (Hamilton et al., 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as posi- tive control [IC50 = 2.72 μm (personal communica- tion, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC50 value was deter- mined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Im- perial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC50 values, and the results were fitted into the equation Y = {Range/[1 + (X/IC50)s]} + Background, where Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in μm), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1). T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assay Bloodstream forms of T. brucei, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% se- rum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of T. brucei was evaluated using the Alamar Blue“ assay (Räz et al., 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 μm. T. cruzi cytotoxicity assay The assay was carried out using blood infected with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi “Y” strain col- lected by cardiac puncture in experimentally in- fected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal mu- rine blood to 2 · 106 trypomastigotes/mL. The as- say was performed in triplicate on titration micro- plates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or com- pounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL and 100 μg/ mL. The plates were incubated at 4 ∞C, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC50 = 31 μg/mL or 76 μm) were run in parallel. The re- sults were expressed as percentage of lysis of try- pomastigote forms compared to the DMSO con- trol. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.

VP-HHL (53%) showed characteristic signals of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. VP-DHL (38%), when submitted to column chromatography, yielded a fraction containing a mixture of steroids which was responsible for 93% of Tc lysis at 500 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table). VP-EHL (36%) yielded compound 18 (31%), and VP-MHL (52%) afforded compounds 18 and 23 (16%). VP-DML, after fractionation, afforded com- pounds 16, 17, and a mixture of flavonoids con- taining quercetin 3-O--d-glucopyranoside and quercetin 4-O--d-glucopyranoside, which caused 97% Tc lysis at 500 μg/L. The same mixture inhib- ited the gGAPDH activity by 92% at 100 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table), which may explain the mechanism of action of the mixture on the trypomastigote forms of the para- site. 16 performed a better activity against T. cruzi (33%, Table II) in comparison with compound 14 (27%), indicating that O-methylation of the 3-hydroxy group was important to improve the activity. VP-BHAL showed a good trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi (60%, Table III), however, the compounds isolated from this fraction did not.

The outcomes from triterpenes 4 (Table I), 24, 25 and 26 (Table II) point out a clear correlation between increasing number of hydroxy groups and higher activity, which justifies a meticulous investi- gation on structure-activity relationships in this case. All the substances tested against T. brucei were inactive, perhaps because of the low concentration (100 μm) tested in contrast to the concentration tested on T. cruzi (500 μg/mL, see Tables I and II). gGAPDH inhibition On the whole, 26 extracts and subfractions were tested. Eleven of them, the most polar (SD-metha- nolic and hydroalcoholic extracts), showed out- comes above 70% (Table III), and the majority belonged to S. densiflora (SD). The ascription of such activities to the hydrolysable tannins 11, 12, 13, and ellagic acid (9) may be considered due to the low IC50 values accomplished by these com- pounds (Table I). Unauthenticated Download Date | 6/29/16 5:49 PM M. B. C. Gallo et al. · Biological Activities of Brazilian Plants 381 Among the flavonoids, the simple and highly oxidized flavonol quercetin (1) was the most ac- tive. The flavone luteolin (14), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduc- tion of the methoxy group at position C-3 (15) or C-3 (16), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested en- zymes (for comparison, see activities of com- pounds 17, 18 and 23 in Table II). The O-glycosyl- ated flavonol quercitrin (2) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone 1. Lio et al. (1985) ob- served the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activi- ties also performed by compounds 21 and 22 (Ta- ble II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I and II). An unseparated mix- ture of lupeol, α-amyrin and -amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from S. densiflora (SD-DML), tested at 200 μm, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentra- tion, a mixture of compound 24 and its isomer 2α,3-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound 24 inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II). APRT inhibition From 17 extracts and subfractions tested, eight presented results greater than 60%. Several could not be screened because they absorbed at the same wavelength used in the bioassay.

Furthermore, quercetin (1) as well as quercitrin (2), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD- EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had ac- tivities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I and II). When analyzing the results dis- played by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hy- droxy groups. Accordingly, compound 29, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to 28 and two in relation to 30, was twice more active than 28 and seven times more than 30 (Table II). TR inhibition All tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (11) and castalagin (12) which performed an IC50 value of 179.3 μm on enzyme inhibition, although this re- sult is not promising in comparison with clomi- pramine, the positive control.

The phytochemical investigation of trypanocidal extracts from leaves and stems of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani (Rutaceae) afforded new pyranoflavones along with the known compounds flavone, 7-methoxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, haplotusine, 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone alkaloid, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosteryl benzoate. Their structures were established based on their spectral data. NMR data for the alkaloid haplotusine and the new pyranoflavones are described for the first time herein. These compounds were assayed on the tripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Among them, haplotusine and 1-methyl-2-phenyl-4-quinolone showed moderate values of IC50 136.9 and 144.9 µM, respectively. Keywords: Conchocarpus heterophyllus; trypanocidal activity; pyranoflavones. INTRODUÇÃO A doença de Chagas, causada pelo protozoário Trypanosoma cruzi, é uma das mais graves endemias do Brasil. No Continente Americano, ela afeta 16-18 milhões de indivíduos, sendo que 100 milhões estão sob risco de contaminação.1 Devido à ampla distribuição geográfica desta doença, à falta de tratamento eficaz e seguro, e às graves manifestações clínicas que ocasiona, a procura de novas substâncias para a profilaxia e/ou tratamento desta endemia se faz necessária. Neste contexto, as plantas são valiosas fontes de novos com- postos ativos e com baixa toxicidade.2 De fato, segundo um levan- tamento recente, 61% dos 877 novos fármacos desenvolvidos du- rante o período de 1981-2002 são produtos naturais, ou substân- cias desenvolvidas a partir deles.3 De plantas da família Rutaceae foram isolados alcalóides e lignanas com atividades tripanocidas.4,5 Além disso, as atividades sobre o T. cruzi ou sobre sua enzima GAPDH (gliceraldeído 3- fosfatodesidrogenase) de vários extratos e algumas substâncias iso- ladas desta mesma família foram determinadas.6-8 A espécie Conchocarpus heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) pertence à família Rutaceae (ordem Rutales) e era anteriormente denominada de Angostura heterophylla (A. St.-Hil.) Alb.9 Nenhum estudo fitoquímico sobre o gênero é descrito na literatura. Entretanto, do gênero Angostura foram isolados alcalóides acridônicos.10 Os extratos e as frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus apresentaram atividade sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 Neste trabalho são descritos o isolamento, as atividades tripanocidas das substâncias obtidas de tais extratos/frações, assim como os dados de RMN do alcalóide haplotusina (1) e das piranoflavonas inéditas (2). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO O estudo químico dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus, ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi, permitiu o isolamento de esteróides, flavonas e alcalóides 2- e 4- quinolônicos. A partir do extrato hexânico do caule de C. heterophyllus foram isolados os esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol;11 da fração diclorometânica proveniente do extrato hexânico das folhas, o benzoato de β-sitosterila12 e uma mistura de piranoflavonas inéditas (2); da fração acetato de etila deste mesmo extrato, flavona, 7-metoxiflavona13 e 5-hidroxiflavona;14 e da fra- ção acetato de etila do extrato metanólico do caule, flavona, 7- metoxiflavona, haplotusina (1)15 e o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4- quinolona (3).16 Todas as substâncias foram identificadas através da análise dos seus dados espectroscópicos e comparação com os da literatura. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) está sendo descrita pela primeira vez Figura 1.

Entretanto, os dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) não estavam descritos.15 No espectro de RMN 1H do alcalóide 1 foram observados quatro sinais relativos a hidrogênios aromáticos [8,00 (dl, J = 8,0 Hz), 7,73 (m), 7,68 (m) e 7,34 δ (ddd, J = 8,0, 6,4 e 1,6 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a presença de um anel aromático orto- dissubstituído na substância 1. Adicionalmente, um singleto em 6,08 δ, integrado para um hidrogênio, revelou a identidade dessa substân- cia como um alcalóide 4-R-2-quinolônico, que é de ocorrência bas- tante ampla em plantas da família Rutaceae.17 Entretanto, apesar do alcalóide 1 ser do tipo 4-R-2-quinolônico, apresenta a ligação N- OCH3, que é bastante incomum. A presença desse grupo foi deduzida a partir do sinal em 63,73 δ no espectro de RMN 13C. As atribuições dos dados de RMN para o alcalóide haplotusina (1) (Tabela 1) foram realizadas através da análise dos mapas de contorno de HSQC e HMBC. A mistura de piranoflavonas (2) foi identificada através de EM e RMN, em uma e duas dimensões. Seu espectro de RMN 1H apre- sentou sinais relativos a oito hidrogênios aromáticos [8,23 (dd, J = 7,9 e 1,6 Hz), 7,84 (dd, J = 7,8 e 1,6 Hz), 7,69 (ddd, J = 8,4, 7,2 e 1,6 Hz), 7,55 (dl, J = 8,4 Hz), 7,42 (m), 7,40 (m), 7,07 (ddd, J = 7,8, 7,8 e 0,9 Hz) e 6,98 δ (dl, J = 8,2 Hz)], cujas multiplicidades indicaram a existência de dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Este fato foi confirmado pela análise do espectro de COSY 1H-1H. O espectro de RMN 1H apresentou ainda um sinal em 5,69 δ (1H, dd, J = 9,5 e 3,4 Hz) e vários sinais na região mais blindada [1,85 e 1,70 (m), 1,25 e 0,88 δ (t)]. Observou-se também que os hidrogênios em 1,85 e 1,70 δ acoplavam entre si e com o hidrogê- nio em 5,69 δ (dd). O mapa de contorno de HSQC permitiu a deter- minação dos deslocamentos químicos dos carbonos (Tabela 2) li- gados aos hidrogênios descritos anteriormente. Os experimentos de RMN 13C indicaram, excetuando-se a região mais blindada, a existência de 8 CH aromáticos e 7 carbonos quaternários, o que sugeriu a natureza de 2 como um flavonóide, mais especificamente como uma flavona. Além disso, definiu-se que tal flavona deveria ser substituída em 3, já que não existia o sinal de H-3 (geralmente em 6,8 δ) e em 2', pois só existiam dois anéis aromáticos orto-dissubstituídos. Por conseqüência, foi determinado que entre os anéis B e C da flavona havia ocorrido ciclização, com formação de um anel pirano. Este tipo de ciclização é observada em flavonóides prenilados.18 Entretanto, nunca foi descrita na literatura a ocorrência de ciclização de uma flavona para uma piranoflavona através de uma cadeia policetídica, como é o caso de 2. A presença do anel pirano foi confirmada através das correlações (2J e 3J) de H-11 (5,69 δ) com C-2 (155,95 δ) e C-3 (114,45 δ). Vale ressaltar, que os carbonos quaternários em 155,95; 155,69 e 154,71 δ, por serem coincidentes na projeção do mapa de contorno de HMBC, foram atribuídos (Tabela 2) por comparação com a 2'-metoxiflavona.13 O carbono carbonílico em 174,85 δ foi determinado como C-4 através de sua correlação (3J) com H-5 (8,23 δ). A espectrometria de massas com ionização por electrospray no modo positivo permitiu que fossem identificadas algumas das piranoflavonas presentes na mistura 2. Através desta técnica analí- tica, determinou-se o tamanho e as insaturações presentes na ca- deia alquílica das diferentes piranoflavonas que constituíam a mis- tura (Tabela 3). Entretanto, a posição da dupla ligação não pode ser determinada. Portanto, a mistura 2 é constituída por piranoflavonas inéditas que se distinguem no tamanho e nas insaturações da ca- deia alquílica (R). As substâncias isoladas foram testadas sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi nas concentrações de 500, 250 e 100 µg/ mL e os valores de IC50 foram calculados a partir dos valores de porcentagem de lise parasitária (% L.P.) obtidos nessas concentra- Tabela 3.

Os resultados (Tabela 4) mostram que dentre as substâncias testadas, as mais ativas foram os alcalóides 1 e 3, apresentando valo- res de IC50 de 136,9 e 144,9 µM, respectivamente. Entretanto, as substâncias testadas não mostraram ser potentes agentes tripanocidas, principalmente quando comparadas ao quimio-profilático violeta de genciana, cujo IC50 é de 83 µM, e com a lignana (-)-metilpluviatolídeo, que na concentração de 67,5 µM ocasionou 99% de lise parasitária.4 Apesar deste fato, os resultados dos testes tripanocidas sugeri- ram que as substâncias isoladas podem ser os princípios ativos das frações e extratos de C. heterophyllus, que foram ativos sobre as formas tripomastigotas do T. cruzi.6 PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Materiais e equipamentos Os espectros de RMN 1H, 13C e dos experimentos 2D foram obtidos em espectrômetros DRX-200 e ARX-400 da Bruker. Fo- ram utilizados CDCl3 ou CD3OD como solventes e tetrametilsilano (TMS) como padrão interno. O espectro de massas foi obtido por injeção direta em um equi- pamento Micromass Quattro LC, utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações A obtenção do material vegetal, dos extratos e frações de folhas e caule de C. heterophyllus estão descritos em Ambrozin et al.6 Isolamento das substâncias A mistura dos esteróides β-sitosterol e estigmasterol foi obtida do extrato AHCH. Este extrato foi inicialmente submetido à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 4,7 x 23,9 cm), utilizan- do-se sílica gel (230-400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH], originando 8 frações. Da quarta fração (AHCH4; 521,3 mg) foi obtida a mistura de esteróides (120,6 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 3,8 x 29,3 cm) de sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hexano→MeOH]. A fração AHFHD (2,0 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 4,1 x 44,8 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel (230- 400 mesh) e eluição gradiente [hex:CH2Cl2→MeOH], originando 7 frações. A quarta fração (AHFHD4; 309,1 mg) foi cromatografada em sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,0 x 47,0 cm) e eluída com MeOH, dando origem a 5 frações. A quinta fração (AHFHD4,5; 5,9 mg) foi identificada como o benzoato de β-sitosterila. A fração AHFHD5 (375,6 mg) foi submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna e à cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa. Tais técnicas per- mitiram a obtenção de 2,8 mg da mistura de piranoflavonas 2. Da fração AHFHA foram obtidas a flavona e a 7-metoxiflavona, segundo procedimento descrito em Ambrozin et al.6 Desta fração também foi isolada a 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHFHA (7,5 g) foi inicialmente submetida à cromatografia líquida em coluna (φ x h = 8,0 x 5,9 cm), utilizando-se florisil como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (hexano→MeOH), obtendo-se 6 frações. A fra- ção 3 (AHFHA3; 1,6 g) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel (230-400 mesh) (φ x h = 3,9 x 25,2 cm), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (9:1) → MeOH), dando origem a seis frações. A sexta fração (AHFHA3,6; 31,4 mg) foi recromatografada em coluna de sephadex LH-20 (φ x h = 3,2 x 49,2 cm) e eluída com MeOH, originando 6 frações, das quais a sexta (AHFHA3,6,5; 5,2 mg) foi identificada como 5-hidroxiflavona. A fração AHCMA (2,4 g) foi submetida à cromatografia líqui- da em coluna (φ x h = 3,2 x 53,0 cm), utilizando-se sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) como fase estacionária e eluição gradiente (CH2Cl2:MeOH (9,5:0,5) → MeOH), para dar origem a 4 frações. A primeira fração (AHCMA1; 872,0 mg) foi cromatografada em coluna de sílica gel 60 (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (7:3) → MeOH), obtendo-se 8 frações. Da quarta fra- ção (AHCMA1,4; 15,5 mg) foi isolada a haplotusina (1) (5,3 mg), através de cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição isocrática (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Da oitava fração (AHCMA1,8; 129,2 mg) foi isolado o alcalóide 2-fenil-1-metil-4-quinolona (3) (22,1 mg), por cromatografia em coluna (φ x h = 2,5 x 58,0 cm) de sílica gel (230-400 mesh), com eluição gradiente (hex:AcOEt (1:1)). Ensaio tripanocida Os ensaios com as formas tripomastigotas de T. cruzi foram realizados no Departamento de Análises Clínicas, Bromatológicas e Toxicológicas da FCFRP-USP, segundo procedimento descrito em Vieira et al.7 Para os ensaios foram utilizadas cepas “Y” de T. cruzi, que são mantidas através de passagens seriadas em camundongos, por meio de repiques semanais, no Laboratório de Parasitologia do Departa- mento de Ciências da Saúde da FCFRP-USP. Os ensaios biológicos das substâncias foram realizados utili- zando-se sangue de camundongos albinos Swiss, infectados pela cepa “Y” do T. cruzi, o qual foi obtido por punção cardíaca no pico da parasitemia (sétimo dia). Esse sangue foi diluído em sangue de animal sadio, de forma a se obter uma concentração final de 2x106 formas tripomastigotas por mL de sangue. Os ensaios foram reali- zados em microplacas de titulação (96 poços), onde o sangue infectado e as misturas (ou substâncias) a serem avaliadas foram solubilizados (em triplicata), e o material foi incubado por 24 h a 4 oC. Após este tempo, a contagem das formas tripomastigotas foi Tabela 4. Atividade tripanocida das substâncias isoladas de C. heterophyllus substância Concentração %L.P.

INTRODUÇÃO O uso de plantas com propriedades inseticidas tem se mostrado uma promissora ferramenta no controle de insetos, por causar menor impacto ambiental, o que atende aos anseios da sociedade moderna.1 Dentre as espécies utilizadas como inseticida, o nim, Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae), é a popularmente mais conhe cida e cujo espectro de ação é bastante amplo, tendo seu efeito comprovado sobre aproximadamente 400 espécies de insetos.2 A partir dos excelentes resultados verificados com o nim, outras meliáceas também passaram a despertar o interesse de pesquisa dores, no intuito de encontrar novas espécies e novas moléculas com atividade inseticida. Várias espécies de Meliaceae se des tacam entre as famílias botânicas que apresentam ingredientes ativos com atividade inseticida, proporcionando eficiência de seus extratos.3 O gênero Trichilia é um deles, pois além de apresentar compostos com atividade inseticida conhecida (triquilinas),4 é bastante abundante nas regiões tropicais da América com mais de 230 espécies conhecidas.5 Mikolajczak e Reed6 realizaram um dos primeiros trabalhos testando a atividade inseticida de Trichilia sobre S. frugiperda. Os extratos etanólicos de T. pallida, T. connoroides, T. prieureana, T. roka e T. triphyllaria testados causaram mortalidade igual ou superior a 80% das lagartas, sendo que apenas a última espécie não afetou a sobrevivência do inseto. Diversos trabalhos comprovando a atividade inseticida de Trichilia ssp. sobre Spodoptera frugiperda têm sido rea lizados.1,7,8 A atividade biológica sobre insetos de alguns limonoides isolados de espécies de Trichilia vem sendo investigada, e resultados promissores foram encontrados.4,9-11 A espécie Trichilia elegans ssp. elegans A. Juss, conhecida popularmente como “Cachuá”, produz madeira resistente e durável, ocorre em matas semidecíduas e possui ampla dispersão no país, sendo encontrada desde Goiás até Santa Catarina, apresenta-se como uma árvore de 3 a 6 m de altura.12 Já a espécie Trichilia catigua A. Juss, são árvores com cerca de 10 m de altura e possuem flores de Matos et al. 1554 Quim. Nova As separações cromatográficas em colunas foram realizadas utilizando-se gel de sílica 60, 70-230, 230-400 mesh e Sephadex LH- 20. As separações por cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE) em condições preparativas foram realizadas em coluna Asahipak GS-310 2G (2,15 x 50,0 cm), utilizando equipamento Shimadzu LC- 8A com válvula de reciclo, injetor Rheodyne 7123 com loop 500 μL e detector UV/VIS Shimadzu SPD-6AV. As análises cromatográficas em camada fina foram realizadas em cromatoplacas de sílica gel F254 sobre placa de alumínio Merck, de 0,2 mm de espessura, empregando-se como revelador a solução de vanilina/ácido sulfúrico. Material vegetal Os frutos de T. elegans e T. catigua foram coletados em Piracica ba/SP no Campus da Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Quei roz” (Esalq/USP) e identificados pelo botânico Dr. Ricardo Ribeiro Rodriguez. Uma exsicata de T. elegans e outra de T. catigua foram depositadas sob os números 80407 e 7394, respectivamente. Preparação dos extratos Os frutos secos (84,0 g) e moídos de T. elegans foram extraídos à temperatura ambiente e em repouso, com solventes em ordem crescente de polaridade (hexano, MeOH e MeOH/água 1:1). As soluções obtidas foram concentradas por destilação do solvente em evaporador rotativo, fornecendo extratos hexânico, metanólico e hidrometanólico. Os frutos de T. catigua foram separados em arilo (3,5 g), semente (8,0 g) e exocarpo (3,0 g) e, posteriormente, secos e moídos. A extração das partes dos frutos de T. catigua foi reali zada utilizando as mesmas condições descritas para os frutos de T. elegans. Os extratos foram submetidos a ensaios biológicos sobre a lagarta-do-cartucho S. frugiperda e os que apresentaram atividade foram fracionados. Isolamento das substâncias de T. elegans O extrato hexânico dos frutos de T. elegans (4,20 g) foi submetido à cromatografia em coluna líquida a vácuo empacotada com sílica gel (230-400 mesh), utilizando-se como fases móveis solventes orgânicos de polaridade crescente: hexano; hexano/AcOEt 9:1; AcOEt e MeOH. Foram obtidas 4 frações após evaporação dos solventes orgânicos: FH1 = 20 mg; FH2 = 2800 mg; FH3 = 970 mg e FH4 = 245 mg. A fração FH3 foi submetida a vários fracionamentos em coluna de sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/ MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), em gradiente de polaridade crescente fornecendo as substâncias 1 (1,0 mg), 2 (1,0 mg), 3 (1,6 mg) e a mistura dos esteroides (8,0 mg). O extrato metanólico dos frutos de T. elegans (5,20 g) foi sus penso em uma mistura MeOH/H2O e particionado sucessivamente com CH2Cl2, AcOEt e n-BuOH. Foram obtidas 3 frações após evaporação dos solventes: FM1 = 1,40 g; FM2 = 0,30 g e FM3 = 3,5g. A fração FM1 foi fracionada em coluna sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com gradiente de CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/ MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), fornecendo após análise por CCDA, a substância 1 (1,6 mg). A fração FM2, após cromatografia em sílica gel (70-230 mesh) utilizando como eluente CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), originou 7 frações (FM2-1 a FM2-7). Da fração FM2-3 foram obtidas as substâncias 2 (10,9 mg) e 3 (3,9 mg), após cromatografia em sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com gradiente de CH2Cl2/MeOH. A fração FM2-4 foi fracionada em sílica gel (70-230 mesh) utilizando como eluente hexano/AcOEt/MeOH (hexano; hexano/AcOEt (10,0→100,0%); AcOEt/MeOH (10,0→100,0%), em polaridade crescente e, poste riormente, via CLAE preparativa (MeOH/CH2Cl2 7:3), fornecendo a substância 4 (3,00 mg). Isolamento das substâncias de T. catigua O extrato metanólico do arilo dos frutos de T. catigua (1,30 g) foi extraído sucessivamente com CH2Cl2 e MeOH. Foram obtidas 2 frações após evaporação dos solventes: FCM1 = 0,14 g; FCM2 = 0,98 g. A fração FCM1 foi submetida a vários fracionamentos em coluna de sílica gel (70-230 mesh), eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), em gradiente de polaridade crescente. Após esses fracionamentos, foi obtida a substância 5 (4,4 mg). A fração FCM2 foi fracionada em coluna de sephadex LH-20 eluída com CH2Cl2/MeOH 1:1, fornecendo após análise por CCDA, as frações FCM2-1 a 6. A fração FCM2-4 foi submetida à purificação por cromatografia em sílica gel (70-230 mesh) tendo como eluente o gradiente CH2Cl2/ MeOH (CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/MeOH (1,0→50,0%); MeOH), fornecendo o limonoide 6 (1,0 mg). A fração FCMC-6 foi submetida ao mesmo processo de fracionamento cromatográfico e levou ao isolamento da mistura contendo 7 e 8 (3,6 mg). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO Ensaios biológicos realizados com extratos orgânicos de frutos de T. elegans e T. catigua sobre S. frugiperda mostraram que os extratos hexânico, metanólico e hidrometanólico de sementes de T. catigua provocaram mortalidades larvais moderadas (≅ 50,0 %) (Tabela 1). A mais alta taxa de mortalidade larval (100,0 %) foi obtida com os extratos hexânico e metanólico de frutos de T. elegans. Para os extratos hexânico e metanólico de frutos de T. elegans foi observada incapacidade das larvas para empuparem, que pode estar relacionada com variações hormonais nos insetos afetados, pois elas não conseguiram fazer a muda. Os mesmos resultados foram obtidos para larvas tratadas com azadiractina; além disso, azadiractina tem se mostrado capaz de interferir com a ecdíse.14 Em estudos anteriores, vários limonoides foram isolados dos frutos de T. elegans,13,15 mas suas atividades ainda não foram determinadas.

Constituintes químicos e atividade inseticida 1555 Vol. 32, No. 6 Os extratos hexânico e metanólico de frutos de T. elegans apre sentaram mortalidade similar ao extrato aquoso das sementes de Azadirachta indica sobre larvas de S. exempta, demonstrando ser um poderoso inseticida.14 Uma alta taxa de mortalidade representa uma das atividades inseticidas mais eficientes, já que atua logo nas primeiras fases da praga, diminuindo seu ataque na cultura e con tribuindo para o decréscimo das populações subsequentes. Assim, o estudo deste extrato é de suma importância, seja na sua forma bruta ou visando o isolamento de seus constituintes químicos. Ao se fracionar o extrato metanólico de frutos de T. elegans foram isoladas as cumarinas (1-3) e o limonoide (4), do extrato hexânico foram isoladas as mesmas cumarinas e os esteroides. Há na litera tura relatos de atividade antialimentar de furanocumarinas sobre S. exigua16 e S. litura.17 Apesar da baixa atividade inseticida do extrato metanólico do arilo de T. catigua (10%, Tabela 1) este foi fracionado e foi possível isolar os limonoides cedrelona (5), angolensato de metila (6) e a mistura epimérica de fotogedunina (7 e 8). O estudo químico do extrato hexânico dos frutos de T. elegans resultou no isolamento e identificação das cumarinas escoporona (1), escopoletina (2), umbeliferona (3) e na identificação da mistura dos esteroides: β-sitosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol e sitosteno na. As estruturas das cumarinas escoporona (1), escopoletina (2), umbeliferona (3) foram elucidadas com base nas análises dos dados de EM, RMN 1H 13C, além da comparação com dados publicados anteriormente.18 A mistura dos esteroides foi identificada através de análises por CG-EM, comparando-se os espectros de massas obtidos com os espectros existentes no banco de dados do equipamento, por RMN 1H e 13C e também por comparação com dados da literatura.19 O cromatograma de íons totais da análise por CG-EM apresentou 4 picos. O espectro de massas dos picos correspondentes apresentou íons moleculares em m/z 414, 412, 400 e 412, concordantes com os espectros de massas do sitosterol, estigmasterol, campesterol e sitostenona, respectivamente, sendo o esteroide sitosterol o composto majoritário desta mistura. A fração de T. elegans em AcOEt, resultante da parti ção do extrato metanólico dos frutos forneceu o limonoide 11β-acetoxiobacunona (4) cuja estrutura foi caracterizada atra vés de dados fornecidos pelo espectros de RMN 1H e 13C 1D e 2D (HSQC, HMBC, Tabela 2), envolvendo comparações com dados descritos na literatura13,20 para compostos com estruturas semelhantes ao limonoide (4). Esta é a primeira vez que os dados de RMN 1H e 13C do limonoide 11β-acetoxiobacunona (4) estão sendo apresentados. No espectro de RMN 1H da substância 4 fo ram observados sinais em δ 7,40-7,42 (m, H-21 e H-23) e δ 6,35 (s, H-22) ppm característicos do anel furano. As atribuições dos C-20 (δ 119,5), C-21 (δ 141,1), C-22 (δ 109,6) e C-23 (δ 143,3) do anel furano foram realizadas através de RMN 13C e confirmadas através do mapa de correlações HSQC e HMBC. O espectro de RMN 1H da substância 4 mostrou cinco singletos muito intensos com integração para três hidrogênios em: δ 1,08 (CH3-18), 1,45 (CH3-28), 1,50 (CH3-30), 1,53 (CH3-29), 1,60 (CH3-19) ppm referentes a grupos metila ligados a carbono sp3. Em δ 3,74 e δ 5,45 ppm observou-se a presença de dois sinais característicos do anel D δ-lactônico com epóxido entre C-14 e C-15, referente aos hidrogênios ligados aos C-15 e C-17, respectivamente. A pre sença de uma dupla ligação conjugada a um carbono carbonílico no anel A, foi determinada pela presença de dois dubletos em δ 6,01 (H-2, J = 12,1 Hz) e δ 6,55 (H-1, J = 12,1 Hz) atribuídos aos hidrogênios olefínicos e ao sinal em δ 166,4 referente ao carbo no carbonílico em C-3. O mapa de correlações HMBC permitiu confirmar a formação de um anel A ε-lactônico α-β insaturado, pois se observaram as correlações dos átomos de hidrogênio em δ 1,45 (s, CH3-28) e δ 1,53 (s, CH3-29) com os átomos de C-4 (δ 83,7) e C-5 (δ 56,6). Os sinais dos hidrogênios H-5, H-6α e H-6β foram atribuídos através das constantes de acoplamento observadas e do mapa de correlações HMBC e HSQC. O H-6α apresenta-se como tripleto largo ( 3,01, J = 14,2 Hz) devido ao acoplamento geminal com o hidrogênio H-6β e pseudo diaxial com H-5 (dd, 2,56, J = 14,2 e 4,6 Hz). Através de partições do extrato metanólico do arilo dos frutos de T. catigua, seguidas de fracionamentos cromatográficos, foram isola dos os limonoides 5-8. As estruturas dos limonoides cedrelona (5),21 angolensato de metila (6)22,23 e mistura epimérica de fotogedunina (7 e 8)24 foram elucidadas com base nas análises dos dados de RMN 1H e 13C 1D e 2D (Cosy, HSQC, HMBC), além de comparações com dados publicados anteriormente. Todos os limonoides isolados do extrato metanólico do arilo de T. catigua apresentam atividade inseticida relevante, no entanto, foi observada uma baixa mortalidade larval deste extrato (10%). Aparentemente esta baixa atividade está relacionada ao fato de se ter somente 1,46% de limonoides no extrato. Por outro lado, tem-se 9,80% de cedrelona (5) no extrato hexânico do arilo de T. catigua. Infelizmente, toda a massa deste extrato foi utilizada para o isolamento da cedrelona (5), deste modo não pôde ser ensaiado. Yajima et al.17 verificaram que a cumarina umbeliferona (3) apresentou atividade antialimentar sobre Spodoptera litura L. (Le pdoptera: Noctuidae) de 45 e 77% a uma concentração de 1000 e 100 ppm, respectivamente. Já o limonoide angolensato de metila (6) mostrou atividade antialimentar no método de disco de escolha convencional no terceiro instar larval de Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae) a 500 μg/mL.25 A mistura epimérica de fo togedunina (7 e 8) apresentou mortalidade larval de 95,83% a 25,0 ppm, ao ser incorporada à dieta artificial para Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepdoptera: Noctuidae).26 Vários são os trabalhos descritos na literatura em que se demons tram as atividades inseticida e antialimentar do limonoide cedrelona (5) sobre diversas espécies de lepdópteras.27 AGRADECIMENTOS Ao CNPq, Capes e FAPESP pelas bolsas e apoios financeiros.

A chemical study on the EtOAc extract produced by Xylaria sp., an endophytic fungus from Piper aduncum, resulted in the isolation of a new cytochalasin 1, along with five known 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5), and R (6). The 1-6 were evaluated against the fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum and only 5 showed weak activity. The cytotoxicity in vitro against HeLA and CHO cells lines were investigated and the cytochalasins 2-4, and 6 showed a strong activity against HeLA. The DNAdamaging activity of 1-6 were also investigated against mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. Keywords: Xylaria sp.; Piper aduncum; endophytic fungus. INTRODUÇÃO Aproximadamente um quarto de todos os produtos naturais biologicamente ativos conhecidos têm sido produzidos por fun gos.1 Estes são estimados em 1,5 milhões de espécies2 distribuídos principalmente entre fungos micoparasitas, coprófilos, de solo, de água doce, epifíticos e endofíticos. Fungos endofíticos são micro- organismos que habitam o interior de um vegetal,3 em pelo menos por um período de seu ciclo de vida. Apesar de serem produtores de metabólitos secundários biologicamente ativos,4 são pouco explorados. Dando continuidade aos estudos de prospecção química e bioló gica em fungos endofíticos isolados de espécies vegetais do cerrado, a espécie vegetal Piper aduncum foi selecionada, pois a medicina popular relata propriedades diurética, cicatrizante e anti-hemorrá gica.5-7 Dados fitoquímicos de P. aduncum relatam a ocorrência de amidas, fenilpropanoides, di-hidrochalconas e derivados prenilados com atividades moluscida, bactericida e citotóxica.8,9 Estes fatos, associados às observações de que micro-organismos endofíticos podem mimetizar a química de seus respectivos hospedeiros e produzirem substâncias ou derivados com maior bioatividade,10 direcionaram o estudo químico/biológico dos fungos endofíticos associados à P. aduncum. P. aduncum foi submetida ao isolamento e à purificação dos endófitos e conduziu a seis linhagens puras. Após triagem quími ca/biológica, a linhagem PA-01 foi classificada como Xylaria sp. e selecionada para estudo, mediante atividade seletiva do extrato bruto AcOEt contra a linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevi siae RS 321 e contra os fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioides e C. sphaerospermum. O fungo Xylaria sp. foi cultivado no meio de cultura PDB, em escala ampliada, para obtenção do extrato bruto que, após fracio namento cromatográfico por CLAE, levou ao isolamento de uma citocalasina inédita (1) e das 19,20-epoxicitocalasina conhecidas D (2), C (3), N (4), Q (5) e (6). A estrutura das substâncias isoladas foi determinada com base nas análises dos dados espectrométricos de IV, EM-ES, RMN de 1H e 13C (1D e 2 D). RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO A fórmula molecular da citocalasina 1 foi estabelecida como C30H37NO7 por ESI-EMAR (m/z 524,2729 [M + H]+) e com auxílio dos espectros de RMN de 13C e DEPT. O espectro no IV mostrou as absorções de hidroxila (3440 cm-1) e uma absorção larga (1710 cm-1) atribuída a estiramentos C=O. A análise dos dados de RMN de 1H, 13C e DEPT indicou a presença de quatro átomos de carbono carbonílico (sendo dois de grupos cetona), um anel benzênico mo nossubstituído, cinco metilas, onze átomos de carbono de grupos metínicos (dois olefínicos e três carbinólicos), dois metilênicos e dois átomos de carbono quaternário, sendo um carbinólico. O índice de deficiência de hidrogênio calculado foi igual a 13. Estes dados são característicos de substâncias da classe das citocalasinas. A atribuição de todos os átomos de hidrogênio aos respectivos átomos de carbonos foi realizada com auxílio dos mapas de contorno do experimento gHMQC. A análise dos espectros de gCOSY e TOCSY indicou os átomos de hidrogênios acoplados em série e permitiu identificar os quatro sistemas de spins da molécula H-2’ a H-6’; H-10 a H-12; H-8 a H-22 e H-19 a H-21. A estereoquímica da ligação dupla entre C-13 e C-14, assim como o epóxido em C-19 e C-20 foi definida como trans pelas constantes de acoplamento (J = 15,5 e 2,0 Hz, respectivamente).11 A correlação gHM BC de H-10a (dH 2,68) com C-1´ (dC 137,5) confirmou a presença do grupo fenil em C-10. As correlações de H-12 (dH 1,01) e H-8 (dH 3,42) Citocalasinas produzidas por Xylaria sp. 2039 Vol. 33, No. 10 com C-7 (dC 212,6) e comparação com dados de citocalasa-13(E),19(E)- dieno-1,7,17-triona,12 possibilitaram a elucidação do núcleo isoindolona. As correlações de H-22 (dH 1,12) e H-23 (dH 1,44) com C-17 (δC 214,9) e entre H-21 (dH 5,43) e C-8 (dC 51,2) e comparação com 19,20-epoxi citocalasina C (3)13 permitiram elucidar o anel macrocíclico. As configurações relativas do núcleo isoindolona e do anel macrocíclico de 1 foram estabelecidas pelo experimento NOESY, onde se observou correlação entre H-4 e H-21, valores dos desloca mentos químicos de RMN de 1H e 13C, constantes de acoplamento e comparação com 18,21-di-hidroxi-16,18-dimetil-10-fenil-citocalasa- 13(E),19(E)-dieno-1,7,17-triona12 e com 19,20-epoxicitocalasina C (3),13 respectivamente, Figura 1. Estas informações permitiram estabelecer a configuração relativa da inédita citocalasina 1. As substâncias 2-6 foram identificadas pela análise por EM, RMN de 1H e 13C, gHMQC, gHMBC, gCOSY e NOESY e por comparação com dados descritos na literatura.13 As citocalasinas 1-6 (Figura 1) foram avaliadas quanto à atividade antifúngica, frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos Cladosporium clados porioides e C. sphaerospermum, usando-se o método da autobiografia direta.14 A substância 5 mostrou uma fraca atividade na concentração de 100 mg mL-1, quando comparada com o padrão nistatina (1mg mL- 1). As outras citocalasinas apresentaram-se inativas. As substâncias 1-6 foram ensaiadas frente à linhagem mutante de Saccharomyces cerevisiae RS 321 mostrando-se inativas, o que indica não serem as responsáveis pela bioatividade inicialmente observada no extrato bruto.15 A avaliação da atividade citotóxica de 1-6 foi realizada em células de mamíferos das linhagens HeLa (tumor de cérvix humano) e CHO (ovário de hamster chinês).16 Para a linhagem não cancerígena CHO, as substâncias 2, 3, 5 e 6 apresentaram IC50 de 90,0; 120,0; 125,0 e 4,00 mmol L-1, respectivamente. As citocalasinas 1 e 4 não apresen taram IC50 nas concentrações testadas, sendo que 1 foi totalmente inativa. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 20 mmol L-1. Na linhagem cancerígena HeLa as substâncias 1-6 apresentaram IC50 de 43,0; 1,0; 2,0; 1,0; 3,0; e 3,0 mmol L-1, respectivamente. A cisplatina foi usada como padrão com IC50 = 5,0 mmol L-1. A forte atividade apresentada pelas citocalasinas 2-5 contra a linhagem cancerígena HeLa e a fraca contra a linhagem não cance rígena CHO evidenciam uma seletividade destas substâncias para as linhagens tumorais HeLa. Para o nosso conhecimento, este é o primeiro relato de citocalasinas sendo produzidas por fungos endofíticos associados à Piper aduncum. PARTE EXPERIMENTAL Instrumentação Os espectros de absorção na região do IV foram obtidos em um espectrômetro Perkin Elmer- FT-IR, utilizando-se pastilhas de KBr. Os espectros de massas foram registrados em espectrômetro de massas de baixa resolução da marca Fisons, modelo VG Pla tfform II, no modo de ionização electrospray (ESI). Os espectros Figura 1. Estruturas das substâncias isoladas de Xylaria sp. Silva et al. 2040 Quim. Nova de massas de alta resolução foram obtidos em espectrômetro QTOF (Micromass), utilizando-se como método de ionização electrospray no modo positivo. Os espectros de RMN foram registrados em CDCl3 e DMSO-d6, no espectrômetro Varian Inova 500, usando TMS como padrão de referência. O aparelho de cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (CLAE) foi um Varian Pro Star, com detectores UV-Vis. As colunas analíticas e preparativas utilizadas foram Phenomenex tipo Luna - C18 (250 x 4,60 mm, 5 mm) e (250 x 21,20 mm, 10 mm), respectivamente. Os meios de cultura líquido e sólido foram submetidos à esterili zação em autoclave a 121 °C e 1 atm de pressão por 20 min. Material vegetal Folhas saudáveis de Piper aduncum foram coletadas na Casa de Vegetação do Instituto de Química - UNESP- Araraquara em maio de 2001. Isolamento dos fungos endofíticos As folhas coletadas foram lavadas com água e sabão, a seguir esterilizadas por imersão em NaClO (1%) por 5 min, seguido de etanol 70% por 1 min e lavadas com água esterilizada 2 vezes por 10 min.17-22 As folhas esterilizadas foram assepticamente seccionadas em segmentos de 1 cm2 aproximadamente e colocados em placa de Petri, contendo o meio de cultura batata dextrose ágar (PDA), marca Difco, preparado na concentração de 39 g/L, acrescido do antibiótico sulfato de gentamicina e incubado a 25 oC. O crescimento dos fungos foi monitorado diariamente e, após cada cultura atingir de 1-2 cm em diâmetro, foram submetidos a sucessivas repicagens até obtenção das linhagens puras. Foram obtidas seis linhagens puras, codificadas como PA-01, PA-02, PA-03, PA-04, PA-05 e PA-06 e depositadas na micoteca do Departamento de Química Orgânica, IQ-UNESP. O isolado PA-01 foi identificado como Xylaria sp. pelo Prof. Dr. L. H. Pfenning e depositado na Coleção Micológica de Lavras, Universi dade Federal de Lavras sob registro CML 292. Cultivo em meio líquido e obtenção dos extratos brutos O fungo endofítico Xylaria sp. foi repicado para placas de Petri, contendo PDA e incubado por 8 dias. A seguir foi inoculado em 20 frascos de Erlenmeyers (500 mL) contendo 200 mL de meio de cultivo PDB (DIFCO), preparado na concentração de 24 g/L, os quais foram mantidos em mesa agitadora a 120 rpm e 25 °C por 28 dias. Após este período o caldo foi separado do micélio por filtração, extraído com AcOEt (3 X 2 L) e concentrado, fornecendo 1,7 g de extrato bruto. O extrato AcOEt foi extraído com CHCl3 obtendo-se assim a fração CHCl3 (0,7 g). Isolamento das citocalasinas A fração CHCl3 (0,7 g) foi fracionada em CC de sílica gel em fase reversa C-18, usando H2O:MeOH em gradiente, fornecendo cinco frações: PA-01-1 (28,0 mg, H2O:MeOH, 9:1), PA-01-2 (90 mg, H2O:MeOH, 7:3), PA-01-3 (320 mg, H2O:MeOH, 5:5), PA-01-4 (42 mg, H2O:MeOH 3:7) e PA-01-5 (8 mg, H2O:MeOH, 0:1). Estas foram analisadas por CLAE-DAD (Si C-18, gradiente H2O:CH3CN 5 a 100% de CH3CN, 40 min, fluxo de 1 mL/min), sendo detectada uma alta concentração de citocalasinas na fração PA-01-3. A fração PA-01-3 foi submetida à CLAE-prep em fase reversa [l = 220 nm, 10 mL/min CH3CN:H2O (68:32)], resultando nas cito calasinas 1 (5,5 mg, tR = 71 min), 2 (17,5 mg, tR = 32 min), 3 (30,0 mg, tR = 54 min), 4 (15,0 mg, tR = 26 min), 5 (15,5 mg, tR = 74 min), e 6 (12,5 mg, tR = 43 min). Bioensaios Teste de bioautografia com fungos Para avaliação da atividade antifúngica do extrato bruto AcOEt e das substâncias 1-6 frente aos fungos fitopatogênicos C. cladosporioi des e C. sphaerospermum, utilizou-se a metodologia descrita anterior mente na literatura.14 Os ensaios foram realizados nas concentrações de 5, 10, 20, 50 e 100 µg mL-1, usando nistatina como controle positivo.

As frações foram monitoradas via RMN 1H e ESI-EM/EM e foram analisadas somente aquelas cujos espectros apresentavam características de alcalóides do ácido antranílico e flavonóides não isolados anteriormente. Foram isolados do caule os alcalóides flindersina, skimmianina, 8-metoxiflindersina e dictamnina; das folhas os flavonóides 3',4',7,8-tetrametoxi-5,6- (2\",2\"-dimetilpirano)-flavona, 3',4',5,7,8-pentametoxiflavona, 5-hidroxi-3',4',6,7-tetrametoxiflavona, 3',4'-metilenodioxi-5,6,7-trimetoxiflavona e 5-hidroxi-3',4'-metilenodioxi-6,7-dimetoxiflavona,. Os alcalóides do ácido antranílico não foram encontrados em dez anos. Vários flavonóides isolados de N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, enxerto de Citrus sinensis (Rutaceae) e Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) foram testados frente a gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de Trypanosoma cruzi, visando verificar seus potenciais em inibir a atividade da enzima. Os flavonóides polimetoxilados e um isoflavonóide foram os mais ativos. Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated an investigation of N. paraensis searching for alkaloids. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR and ESI-MS/MS and only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. Stems afforded the alkaloids flindersine, skimmianine, 8-methoxyflindersine and dictamnine; leaves yielded 3',4',7,8-tetramethoxy-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone, 3',4',5,7,8- pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethoxyflavone, 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. A number of flavonoids isolated from N. paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, Citrus sinensis graft (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma cruzi. Highly oxygenated flavones and isoflavone were the most actives. Keywords: Rutaceae, Leguminosae, Neoraputia, Murraya, Citrus, Lonchocarpus, Trypanosoma cruzi, alkaloid, flavonoids, chemosystematic Introduction Neoraputia species were originally described by Engler as species of Raputia Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus Neoraputia Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them from Raputia and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae.1 Previous investigations of Neoraputia reported the presence of eleven polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-flavones, one 6,7-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)- flavone and one flavanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich;2,3 five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'- hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6'-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-polymethoxylated chalcones from N. 381 Enzymatic Inhibition Studies of Selected Flavonoids Vol. 14, No. 3, 2003 magnifica var. magnifica (Engler) Emmerich;4,5 ten polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)-flavones and one 6-(3”-hydroxy,3”-methyl- trans-but-1”-enyl)-flavone from N. paraensis.6,7 All phytochemical studies on Neoraputia genus have been undertaken in our laboratory and by Arruda et al.6,7, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. If Emmerich’proposal is correct, that Neoraputia is a Cusparieae member, then this genus can be regarded as a potential source of anthranilate alkaloids. Thus, it would be not surprising if anthranilate alkaloids had remained undiscovered in the Neoraputia because of their low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove Neoraputia to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated flavones.4,8 Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of Neoraputia species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae. In order to establish this we have now undertaken a further investigation of N. paraensis. Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is estimated to affect some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organisation). Control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low efficacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side effects.9 The bloodstream form of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production.9 This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined.9 Glyceraldehyde- 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with significant differences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested.9 Highly oxygenated flavones from Neoraputia magnifica have shown to be the most actives as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor.5 These data stimulated an investigation of other flavonoids. Thus, in order to find potential lead compounds, flavonoids isolated from Neoraputia paraensis, N. magnifica, Murraya paniculata, Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limon (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus (Leguminosae) were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. Results and Discussion Our taxonomic interest in the Neoraputia stimulated an investigation of the extracts from stems and leaves of N. paraensis searching for alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on TLC plates. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations. The dichloromethane extract from stems afforded only the alkaloid flindersine (1).10 The HSQC and HMBC experiments on flindersine, permitted minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments.10 Table 1 shows that the signals for C-3 and C-10 to C-12 were reassigned. The observed correlations between the methine hydrogen signal at δ 6.77 and the 13C signals at δ 162.5, 157.3 and 79.1 led to their assignments as C-2, C-4, C-13, respectively. The upfield methine hydrogen signal at δ 5.56 showed correlation with the 13C signals at δ 105.8, 79.1 and 26.3 permitting the assignment of these signals to C-3, C-13 and C-14/15, respectively. The signals at δ 6.77 and 5.56 were then assigned to H-11 and H-12, respectively. The methanolic extract from stems afforded skimmianine,11 8-methoxyflindersine (2)12 and dictamnine.13,14 As no carbon shifts of 2 could be found in the literature, these data are listed in Table 1. Complete and unambiguous 13C NMR assignments for 2 were made using the HSQC and HMBC techniques and using 1 and haplophytin A (3)15 as a models. The methine hydrogen signal at δ 6.71 showed correlation with the 13C signals at δ 157.1 permitting the assignment of these signals to H-11 and C-4. Thus, in compound 1 and 2, H-11 is more deshielded than H-12. However, in model 3 the presence of the methoxyl at C-5 caused downfield shift of the usual range for 4,O-3-chromene quinolines, resulting in the H-12 being more deshielded than H-11. The methoxyl at C-5 also induces effects on C-10 and C-3, exhibiting upfield displacement for C-10 and downfield displacement for C-3. These data were also confirmed by HMBC experiments.15 The n-hexane extract of the leaves yielded 3',4',7,8- tetramethoxy-5,6-(2\",2\"-dimethylpyrano)-flavone3 (4) which has not been recorded from N. paraensis. The dichloromethane extract from leaves gave four flavonoids, 382 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 3',4',5,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone16 (5), 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7- tetramethoxyflavone17 (6), 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone5 (7) and 8, which are reported for the first time from N. paraensis, while the latter appears to be new. The flavone 8 exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3',4'-substitution (δ 7.33, d, J 1.8 Hz, H-2'; δ 6.93, d, J 8.2 Hz, H-5'; δ 7.46, dd, J 8.2 and 1.8 Hz, H-6'). This spectrum also showed signals for two methoxy groups (δ 3.97, s; 3.92, s), one methylenedioxy group (δ 6.08, s, 2H), one hydroxyl group at δ 12.73 (1H, s, OH-5) and two singlets at δ 6.54 (H-8) and 6.55 (H-3) indicating the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisubstituted and a flavone nucleus. The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)17 fragments in ESI-MS/MS of this flavone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A- and B- rings. Thus, a combination of 1H NMR data and the fragment ions at m/z 146 (30%) and 181 (RDA-Me, 100%) fully supported the presence of 3',4'-methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy or 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy system in the A-ring. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5-OH-7,8- and 5-OH- 6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-OH-3,7,8- and 5-OH-3,6,7- trimethoxyflavonol indicated that C-6 methine (ca. δ 96) resonates at lowerfield than C-8 methine (ca. δ 91).18 Thus, Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts for alkaloids 1, 2 and model 3 1 a 2 a 3 a Atom δC δH m HMBC δC δH m HMBC δC δH m J 1H → 13C J 1H → 13C J 2 162.5 160.5 162.4 3 105.8 106.2 115.7 4 157.3 157.1 156.0 5 122.6 7.89 d 157.3 114.6 7.46 dd 110.3 155.0 (7.5) 137.2 (8.0, 1.0) 127.9 130.8 6 122.2 7.19 t 115.4 121.7 7.10 t 115.7 103.5 (7.5) (8.0) 145.5 7 130.8 7.48 t 137.2 110.3 6.94 dd 114.6 120.5 (7.5) 122.6 (8.0, 1.0) 127.9 8 115.9 7.33 d 122.2 145.5 117.4 (7.5) 115.4 9 137.2 127.9 132.9 10 115.4 115.7 106.5 11 117.2 6.77 d 79.1 117.3 6.71 d 79.1 126.2 5.54 d (9.9) 157.3 (9.9) 157.1 (9.9) 162.5 12 126.2 5.56 d 26.3 126.2 5.52 d 79.1 117.5 6.76 d (9.9) 79.1 (9.9) 106.2 (9.9) 105.8 13 79.1 79.1 79.0 14/15 26.3 1.54 s 28.1 1.52 s 28.0 N-H - 11.5 s - 8.87 s OMe - - 56.0 3.95 s 55.7 a (in CDCl3).

From these data 8 was characterised as 5-hydroxy-3',4'- methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy- flavone (9)18 and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxy- flavone (10).5 Preliminary work was firstly undertaken on specimens collected in Paragominas, state of Pará, north of Brazil, in February 1991.6,7 The present results obtained from specimens originating from Uruçuca, Bahia (February 1993), showed that there was no difference in the flavonoids between the two collections. However, alkaloids were obtained only from plants of northeast region (Bahia), which is characterized by drought summer, compared to rainy summer in the northern (Pará). In contrast, Neoraputia alba and N. magnifica collected in Espirito Santo, near northeast of Brazil, had only high concentration of flavonoids. Thus, geographic-variation do not seem to be an important environmental factor. The low concentration of anthranilate alkaloids is likely to be responsible for the alkaloids have remained undiscovered for 10 years. All alkaloids were obtained in very small amounts (1-3 mg), only flindersine (1) was present in substantial amounts (10 mg). In a previous paper concerning the chemical systematics of Cusparieae, which Neoraputia has been assigned,8 the importance of coumarins and anthranilate alkaloids was highlighted. This study brings into focus polyoxygenated flavonoids as another taxonomically useful chemical marker in this group. Many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds presents in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far. A number of flavonoids isolated from Neoraputia paraensis, N. magnifica,4,5 Murraya paniculata,19 Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limon20 (Rutaceae), Lonchocarpus montanus21 (Leguminosae) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. The positive results are summarized at Table 3 and the occurrence of flavonoids evaluated at Table 4. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 65% when 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethoxy-5',6'-(2\",2\"- dimethylpyrano)chalcone (11) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1, suggesting that chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The flavones 3',4',5',5,7- pentamethoxyflavone (12), 3',4',5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone (13), 4',5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (14) and flavonol 3’,4’,5’,3,5,6,7-heptamethoxyflavonol (15) completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 99-100%) at 100 µg mL-1. The activity does not appear to be affected by the introduction of the 3-OMe substituent into the flavone Table 3.

However, the activity of 3’,4’,5’,3,5,7,8- heptamethoxyflavonol (16) was comparable to that of 15 but, reducing the enzymatic activity by 88% at 100 µg mL-1. This finding shows that the activity varies with the position of methoxyl group. The higher activity of 12, 13, 14 and 15 could possibly be attributed to a greater symmetry of electron density of the molecules. Flavones 3',4'-methylenedioxy- 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (10) and 3',4'-methylenedioxy-5,6,7- trimethoxyflavone (7) do not display significant GAPDH activity (26% and 36%, respectively) showing that 3',4'- methylenedioxy reduce drastically inhibitory activity. Differences between polyoxygenated flavones and isoflavone afrormosine (17) inhibitory activities are not significant, indicating that the presence of many methoxy groups in isoflavones are not a requirement for activity. However, isoflavone possess 3-phenylchromone skeleton and it may be incorrect to compare it with the other flavones tested. GAPDH activity was also inhibited by 96% when auronol derriobtusone A (18) was added to the assay system at a concentration of 100 µg mL-1. 385 Enzymatic Inhibition Studies of Selected Flavonoids Vol. 14, No. 3, 2003 Thus, clearly isoflavonoids and auronoids deserve more attention as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase- inhibitors. Highly oxygenated flavones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal GAPDH. However, to develop an effective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make specific interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the specificity in the catalytic-site-activity relationships among flavonoids and the enzyme GAPDH.

Plant material Neoraputia paraensis was collected in Uruçuca, Bahia, Brazil, and a voucher (SPF 81-316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociências, USP, São Paulo. Isolation of compounds Ground stems (2700 g) and leaves (409 g) of Neoraputia paraensis were extracted with n-hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. Only the concentrated extracts containing alkaloids, which were detected by the characteristic color with Dragendorff’s reagent on thin- layer chromatography plates, were worked. Fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS and were examined only those which showed features of anthranilate alkaloids and flavonoids absent in the previous investigations. The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from stem was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel. Elution with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1:0.2) afforded 16 fractions. Fraction 4 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 1 (10 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The concentrated CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography over silanized silica elution with MeOH-H2O (1:1) afforded 10 fractions. Fraction 8 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient affording 2 fractions. Fraction 1 was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH (5:0.4:0.4) and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH (4.6: 0.6:0.4) affording skimmianine (3 mg). Fraction 2 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 Å pore diameter; eluant: CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1); flow rate: 4.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, λ 254 nm) to give 2 (second peak, 1.2 mg) and dictamnine (first peak, 1.0 mg), after four cycles of 80 min. The concentrated n-hexane extract of the leaves was four times flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc- MeOH gradient, n-hexane-EtOAc gradient, and finally with silica gel and Florisil (1:1) eluting with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 (20 mg). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient and finally with CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was purified by R-HPLC (the column used was a Shodex Asahipack GS- 310P; eluant: MeOH; flow rate: 5.0 mL min-1) (detection UV, λ 240 nm) to give 8 (second peak, 2.7 mg), after three cycles of 60 min. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 also were purified by R-HPLC (as above; flow rate: 6.0 mL min-1) to give 5 (second peak, 5.0 mg), 6 (second peak, 4.0 mg) and 7 (second peak, 3.0 mg) after three cycles of 60 min, respectively. 5-Hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone (8).

Preparation and purification of recombinant T. cruzi GAPDH TcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as reported by Souza et al.9 It is maintained in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. T. cruzi GAPDH-activity TcGAPDH activity was determined according to a 386 Moraes et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. modification of a previously reported procedure.23 Reduced NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 30s interval. The reaction medium was 50 mmol L-1 Tris- HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 β- mercapto-ethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD+, 0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 4-9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 µL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The specific activity (unit = U) of the enzyme was calculated as: (U mg-1) = {(∆ absorbance/∆ t) x volume of cell}/6.22 x volume of enzyme x [ enzyme] where ∆t = 0.5 min; volume of cell = 1.00 mL; εNADH = 6.22 (mmol L-1)-1 cm-1; volume of enzyme = 0.005 mL; [enzyme] concentration of enzyme in mg mL-1. T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activity The inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 µL. Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30s interval. Flavonoids were tested at 50 and 100 µg mL-1 in 10% DMSO using 5 µL of GAPDH at 0.90 mg mL-1. In each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO in the reaction medium and was used as the positive control. The specific activity of TcGAPDH was not significantly affected by the presence of 10% DMSO. Data were means of 3 repetitions and values as percent of control were used as follows: % inhibitory activity = {(U mg-1 control – U mg-1 compound)/U mg-1 control} x 100 Enzymatic inhibition studies have been carried out in the Crystallography Laboratory of the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. Some of the potentially active substances, as flavones 6 and 8, can not be assayed with the standard procedure described here, due to problems of solubility in the reaction buffer and absorption of light close to the wavelength used to observe the reaction course (340 nm). To overcome these limitations an alternative technique is being developed, based on calorimetric measurements, similar to procedures adopted with other enzymes.24 Acknowledgements The authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvol- vimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES).

Através da análise dos dados espectroscópicos foram estabelecidas as estruturas químicas das substâncias isoladas sendo que para os alcalóides inéditos tais dados são descritos pela primeira vez.

The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract from leaves of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. (Rutaceae) afforded two new compounds 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H- pyran-2-one and rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]-4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8- tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b]quinoline-7-yl acetate, along with the known compounds arborinine, N-methyl- 1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone, skimmianine, kokusagine, isodutaduprine, isoskimmianine, and isokokusagine. Their structures were established based on their spectral data, and for the new compounds these data are described herein. Additionally, these compounds were assayed on the tripomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi showing moderate trypanocidal activity. Keywords: Almeidea rubra, Rutaceae, alkaloids, trypanocidal activity Introduction The genus Almeidea belongs to Rutaceae family and is widely distributed in Brazil. Data about the secondary metabolites of this genus are available. From Almeidea guyanensis was isolated C-arabinosyl flavones, 2- and 4- quinolones, and flavone C-glycosides.1 We have previously reported the isolation of triterpenoids, acridone, 2-quinolone, and furoquinoline alkaloids, and a new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid from A. coeruela and A. rubra2 besides steroids, one sesquiterpene, one cromone, and one flavone.3 Chagas’ disease (American Trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affecting more than 18 million people in Latin America.4 Its treatment is still a challenge and new less toxic and more effective drugs are necessary. As a part of our search for new trypanocidal compounds and our studies on the chemistry of Rutaceae, a new specimen of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. was investigated. Thus, here we report the isolation, identification and characterization of two new substances (1 and 2a) and seven known compounds (3-9) from methanol extract of leaves of this plant, in addition to their trypanocidal activities. Results and Discussion The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction of 435 New Pyrone and Quinoline Alkaloid from Almeidea rubra and their Trypanocidal Activity Vol. 16, No. 3A, 2005 methanol extract from leaves of A. rubra afforded two new compounds (1 and 2a) and known compounds (Figure 1) arborinine (3), N-methyl-1-hydroxy-3-methoxyacridone (4),5 skimmianine (5),6 kokusagine (6),7 isodutaduprine (7),8 isoskimmianine (8), and isokokusagine (9), which were identified through comparison of their NMR spectral data with the literature. Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow powder and its structure was determined by analysis of NMR and LRMS. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed aromatic protons at δ 7.33 (2H, m), and 6.70 (2H, m), assigned to H-4’, H-6’, and H-3’, H5’, respectively. Two olefinic protons (H-3 and H-5) appeared at δ 5.49, and 6.23 (d, J 2.2 Hz) assigned to an 2- pyrone by comparison with a styryl-2-pyrone described by Pizzolatti et al.,9 besides broad N-H and N-CH3 signals at δ 5.36, and 2.87. Furthermore, a singlet at δ 3.85 (3H) revealed the presence of the methoxyl group in the molecule. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 13 carbons, distinguished as 5 quaternaries (δ 171.7, 164.0, 162.8, 147.6, 116.0), 4 aromatics (δ 132.3, 129.2, 116.4, 111.2), 2 ofelinics (δ 100.1, 87.3), 1 methoxyl (δ 55.9), and 1 N- methyl carbon (δ 30.4). The analysis of 13C NMR and HSQC spectrum allowed us to attribute undoubtedly all chemical shifts to methyl, vinyl, and aromatic carbons/ hydrogens of 1 (Table 1). The assignments of quaternary carbons were possible from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-2’ was deduced from 3J correlation between N-CH3 hydrogens (δ 2.87) and one carbon at δ 147.6. C-4 (δ 171.7) was assigned through 3J correlation between the lowerfield carbon and methoxyl hydrogens (δ 3.85). Furthermore, C-6 (δ 162.8) and C-1’ (δ 116.0) were determined through 2J-3J correlation to H-5 (δ 6.23). Finally, through the 2J correlation between H-3 (δ 5.49) and a carbonyl carbon at δ 164.0 was attributed C-2. All these results allowed us to propose the structure 4- methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one for compound 1, which is described for the first time in the literature and represents a new class of compounds formed by the reaction of anthranilic acid and two acetyl/malonyl- CoA units. Single crystal X-ray diffraction established undoubtedly the structure of 1 as a derivative of anthranilic acid (Figure 2). The crystal structure of compound 1 shows the presence of two independent molecules per asymmetric unit (Figure 2). The main conformational difference between both independent molecules is centered in the dihedral angle between the least square planes that pass through the aromatic rings in each molecule. The value of this angle in molecule 1 is 33.58(8)° and in molecule 2 is 34.79(8)°. The crystal structure also shows the presence of one intramolecular interaction in each molecule. These interactions are slightly different due to the conformation Figure 1. Compounds isolated from Almeidea rubra. Table 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. changes. The analyses of the crystal packing show the presence of four intermolecular interactions of the type C- H…O that give rise to the formation of chains along the (101) direction. These chains are connected with the chain just above and below it through three intermolecular interactions of the N-H…O type. The quinoline and acridine alkaloids, which are widely distributed in Rutaceae, arise from combination of anthranilic acid and acetate/malonate.10 In these cases, the ciclization takes place by nucleophilic attack of nitrogen atom to the carboxyl carbon. However, compound 1 should be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom to the carboxyl carbon, giving rise an α-pyrone. We have previously reported the isolation of the new tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid 2b (Figure 1) from A. coerulea.2 Reinvestigation of A. rubra afforded an alkaloid 2a whose spectral data seem to be very similar to those of 2b. This alkaloid was isolated as a white powder and identified by NMR and LRMS. The molecular formula C20H25NO6 of 2a was defined by elemental analysis. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2a were observed a pair of doublets (J 2.6 Hz) at δ 7.58 and 6.97, and a singlet at δ 4.30, which indicate that 2a was a tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid. The signals at δ 2.78, 2.20, and 2.01, assigned to H-5, and H-6, respectively, confirmed that 2a had a reduced furoquinoline ring. 1H NMR spectrum of 2a also showed two singlets at δ 3.14, and 2.03, and a group of signals at δ 6.06 (d, J 16.1 Hz), 5.69 (d, J 16.1 Hz), 1.34 (s), and 1.31 (s), which indicated the presence of the 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent. Through the spectral data comparison, it was established that 2a distinguished from 2b by the presence of 3-hydroxy-2-isopentenyl substituent instead of γ,γ-dimethylallyl moiety. Analysis of HSQC correlations and literature data2 allowed us to attribute undoubtedly chemical shifts to methyl, methylene, vinyl, furanyl hydrogen/carbon of 2a (Table 2). The assignments of quaternary carbons of 2a were made from observed correlations in the HMBC spectrum. The chemical shift of C-4 was deduced from 3J correlation between methoxyl hydrogens at C-4 (δ 4.30) and one carbon at δ 158.2. The correlation of the other methoxyl hydrogens (δ 3.14) and one carbon at δ 79.7 determined Figure 2. ORTEP-3 diagram of compound 1. Table 2.

C-4a was assigned through correlation between the carbon at δ 117.6 and H-5, and H-6 (δ 2.78, and 2.01). H-5 also correlated to C-8a (δ 150.0). Furthermore, methyl hydrogens at δ 1.34, and 1.31, correlated with an oxygenated carbon at δ 70.8, establishing C-3”. Finally, the correlation between furanyl hydrogens (δ 7.58, and 6.97) and quaternary carbons at δ 162.7, and 105.2 determined C-2, and C-3, respectively. The close similarity between the chemical shifts observed for carbons of reduced furoquinoline ring when compared with the model compound 7-O-acetylha- plophyllidine (2b)2 led us to suggest a trans relationship between the 7-acetoxy and 8-methoxy groups. Alkaloid 2a, rel-(7R,8R)-8-[(E)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-butenyl]- 4,8-dimethoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro [2,3-b]quinoline-7- yl acetate, is described for the first time in the literature, and the occurrence of tetrahydrofuroquinoline alkaloid such as 2a and 2b seems to be restricted to the genera Almeidea and Haplophyllum of Rutaceae family.2,11 In order to improve the therapy of Chagas disease, we have been studying species of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, Burseraceae, and Cneoraceae) aiming to isolate hit compounds that could be used in the development of new antichagasic drugs. Compounds described in this paper were isolated from an active fraction of A. rubra (62.9% lysis – percent reduction of the parasite number) on the tripomastigote forms of T. cruzi.12 Their in vitro trypanocidal actions are shown on Table 3. Three of them (7-9) could not be assayed due to their instability. The results showed that all of compounds had moderate trypanocidal actions and kokusagine (6) was the most active one. Probably, they are responsible by the activity of the A. rubra fraction.12 However, they could not be considered good prototype for the development of new antichagasic drugs, mainly when their activities are compared with crystal violet and some lignans also isolated from other Rutaceae.13 Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using either Bruker DRX-200 and ARX- 400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Low resolution EIMS were recorded on GC-17A, GCMS-QP5000 Shimadzu. Plant material The leaves of Almeidea rubra A. St.-Hil. were collected in May 2000 in Espírito Santo State, southeast of Brazil. The plant material was identified by Dr. José Rubens Pirani from the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani et al. 4746) was deposited at the Herbarium of that Department. Extraction and isolation Dried leaves (313.5 g) were extracted first with hexane and then with MeOH at room temp. Part of the methanol extract (15.9 g) was submitted to VLC on silica gel 60 (70- 230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, to yield the corresponding fractions (ALFMH, ALFMD, ALFMA, ALFMM). The fraction ALFMA (3.3208 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 410 x 43 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give eleven fractions. The second fraction (ALFMA2; 0.6302 g) was chromatographed on silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 358 x 31 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:AcOEt 8:2→MeOH) to afford ten fractions. Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) from the fraction five (ALFMA2,5; 103.6 mg) was obtained four fractions. Then, the second fraction (ALFMA2,5,2; 68.0 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2→MeOH gradient) to give four fractions. The third fraction (ALFMA2,5,2,3; 36.0 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH (1:1) to afford six fractions. Through column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 394 x 32 mm i.d., stepwise with a CH2Cl2→MeOH gradient) of the fraction five (ALFMA2,5,2,3,5; 14.3 mg) was isolated the alkaloid 2a (2.6 mg). Fraction four (ALFMA4; 178.1 mg) was chroma- tographed on sephadex LH-20 column (492 x 32 mm i.d.) Table 3.

Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) of the third fraction (ALFMA4,3; 59.9 mg) was obtained the alkaloid 5 (ALFMA4,3,7; 2.5 mg) and eight fractions. Then, the fourth fraction (ALFMA4,3,4; 2.3 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (332 x 25 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH 1:1) to give three fractions. Further purification of the fraction two (ALFMA4,3,4,2; 2.0 mg) on preparative planar silica plate with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) afforded alkaloid 6 (1.6 mg). Through column chromatography over sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with CH2Cl2:MeOH) of the fraction five (ALFMA4,3,5; 21.5 mg) was isolated the compound 1 (14.7 mg). The alkaloids arborinine (3) (43.2 mg), isodutaduprine (7) (25.6 mg), and isoskimmianine (8) (28.8 mg) were crystallized in MeOH from fraction six (ALFMA6; 104.5 mg), seven (ALFMA7; 317.3 mg) and nine (ALFMA9; 120.5 mg), respectively. The other alkaloid isokokusagine (9) (32.1 mg) was purified on sephadex LH-20 (492 x 32 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH) from fraction eight (ALFMA8; 90.3 mg), and the alkaloid 4 (3.2 mg) was obtained from fraction three (148.8 mg). 4-methoxy-6-[2-(methylamino)phenyl]-2H-pyran-2-one (1) Yellow powder; elemental analysis (Found: C, 68.0432; H, 5.565904; N, 6.11885.

Single crystal X-ray analysis Low temperature X-ray diffraction data collection was performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid N2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 50° in 2θ, with a redundancy of 4. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program;14 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs.15 No absorption corrections were applied. The structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97.16 The model was refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 with SHELXL-97.17 All the hydrogen atoms were set isotropic and freely refined. The programs SHELXL-97,17 and ORTEP-318 were used within WinGX19 to prepare materials for publication. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles, and thermal parameters have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. The supplementary crystallographic data have been sent in electronic format to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, as CIF file No. CCDC 242119.

Trypanocidal activity in vitro As described by Ambrozin et al.,12 the bioassays were carried out using blood of infected Swiss albino mice, which was collected by cardiac puncture at the peak of parasitemic infection (7th day of infection for Y strain of T. cruzi). The infected blood was diluted with healthy mice blood to achieve a concentration of 2.106 forms/mL. Solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The activities of substances were evaluated at 500, 250, and 100 µg/mL. The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) which contained 400 µL mixture/ well. The plates were incubated at 4 oC, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h, following the method described by Brener.20 Infected blood with the same volume of DMSO was used as control, and gentian violet to a concentration of 250 µg/mL was used as positive control. The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 values were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

O fracionamento biomonitorado levou ao isolamento do ácido protocatecuico e de dois flavonóides glicosilados: afzelina e quercetrina, os quais exibiram atividade sequestradora de radicais livres frente ao DPPH (∆A 32, 16 e 73% a 50 µmol L-1) e foram comparados aos antioxidantes comerciais rutina (81% a 50 µmol L-1) e BHT (9% a 50 µmol L-1), usados como substâncias de referência. Além disso, três neolignanas inativas, incluindo a nova neolignana biciclo[3.2.1]octânica 2’-oxo-piperol B, foram obtidas e caracterizadas por métodos espectrométricos. The EtOH crude extract from the leaves of Nectandra grandiflora collected in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, showed antioxidant activity towards β-carotene in a TLC assay. The bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of protocatechuic acid and two flavonol glycosides: afzelin and quercetrin, which showed free radical scavenging activity towards DPPH (∆A 32, 16 and 73% at 50 µmol L-1) and were compared to commercial antioxidants rutin (81% at 50 µmol L-1) and BHT (9% at 50 µmol L-1), used as standard compounds. Additionally, three inactive neolignans, including the new bicycle[3.2.1]octane neolignan 2’-oxo-piperol B were obtained and characterized by spectrometric methods. Keywords: Nectandra grandiflora, Lauraceae, neolignan, flavonoid, radical scavenging activity, antioxidant Introduction Nectandra grandiflora Nees is a tree belonging to Lauraceae family, which is known for economically important species such as Aniba roseodora (“pau-rosa”), the main source of sesquiterpene (linalool)-rich essential oil used in perfumery; and species with scented leaves and bark such as Laurus nobilis (bay leaves) and Ocotea odorifera (Brazilian cinnamon), widely used as condiments.1-3 Lignans and neolignans are important classes of secondary metabolites occurring in Lauraceae species, which include several medicinally important closely related compounds as the anti-mitotic podophyllotoxin, extracted from Podophyllum peltatum (Berberidaceae), used in the preparation of the antitumoral lignans etoposide and teniposide, and the antioxidant nor- dihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), obtained from Larrea tridentata (Zygophyllaceae).4 Nectandra species are extensively used in folk medicine due to their antirrheumatic, digestive and diuretic properties.5 Some of the claimed medicinal properties have been substantiated by studies, e.g. on Nectandra salicifolia, which showed antifungal and vascular muscle relaxing properties,6 in addition to antimalarial activity due to the presence of the alkaloid costaricin in its bark extract.7 Previous work on N. grandiflora evidenced the presence of aporphine alkaloids and antitumoral activity in its bark extract.8 A number of pathologies are known to be ultimately associated with the imbalance of pro and antioxidant factors in living systems. Exogenous antioxidant compounds may therefore exert beneficial actions upon 527 A New Neolignan and Antioxidant Phenols from Nectandra grandiflora Vol. 16, No. 3B, 2005 systems which have been deprived from sufficient amounts of endogenous antioxidants as in some cardiovascular diseases, tumors, inflammation, ulcer and aging.9 As part of our ongoing projects aiming the phytochemical investigation of São Paulo State flora,10-12 the EtOH crude extract from leaves of N. grandiflora collected at Jureia State Park, Atlantic Forest, have been subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation using the β-carotene test on TLC for the detection of antioxidant compounds.13 Pure compounds isolated from this extract were further evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity towards the stable free radical DPPH and compared to standard compounds rutin and BHT.11,14 Non-active fractions were also investigated and afforded the benzofuran neolignan burchellin and two bicyclooctane[3.2.1] neolignans: piperol B and the new 2’-oxo-piperol B. Results and Discussion The EtOH crude extract of N. grandiflora leaves was successively partitioned with organic solvents affording hexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and MeOH extracts. The TLC test using β-carotene as revealing agent indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds in the EtOAc and MeOH fractions. Chromatographic fractionation of these extracts led to the isolation of protocatechuic acid (6) and flavonol glycosides afzelin (4) and quercetrin (5), which were identified through analyses of their MS and NMR spectra and comparison with literature data.15,16 Fractionation of the CHCl3 extract led to the isolation of neolignans 1-3. Compound 1 was obtained as a light brown viscous oil and its 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 signals for sp2 carbons and 9 signals for sp3 carbons, including three signals at ca. δ 56, assigned to three methoxy groups on sp2 carbons (Table 1). These data combined with HRMS analysis in the positive ion mode [(C21H24O5, (M+1)+• 357; expanded to C18H15O2.(OCH3)3] suggested compound 1 is a bicarbonyl neolignan, with 13C NMR signals for C=O groups at δ 190.5 and δ 203.0. The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed three broad doublets at δ 2.48, δ 5.08 and δ 5.14, and one multiplet at δ 5.89 assigned to hydrogens of an allyl moiety. Additionally, a doublet at δ 0.99 (3 H-9) and a quintuplet at δ 2.08 (H-8) indicated compound 1 is a guianin type bicyclooctane neolignan.17,18 The absence of a doublet at ca. δ 5.90 for an oxybenzylic hydrogen of the related benzofuran type neolignans, gave additional support to this proposal. Its relative stereochemistry was deduced from the absence of anisotropy from the aromatic ring on the deshielded H-9 (δ 0.99) evidencing a trans relationship between methyl group C-9 and the aromatic ring.17,18 Table 1.

J. Braz. Chem. Soc. Moreover, the bicycle bridge associated with the guianin type configuration of 1 is evidenced by the absorption of H- 6’ at δ 5.72. Further analysis of NMR spectra and comparison with literature data for other guianin-type compounds suggested the presence of an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and an additional carbonyl (C-2’, ν 1760 cm-1) in the bicyclic moiety.17,18 HMQC correlations allowed the complete assignment of hydrogen signals to carbons; and HMBC correlations of C-2’ to H-7, H-3’ and H-7’; and C-4’ to H-7 and H-3’ supported the position of carbonyl groups at C-2’ and C-4’ in the bicyclic moiety, respectively (Figure 1). This spectrum also showed correlations of C-5’ to H-3’; C-7’ to H-6’; and C-1 to H-7, H-8 and H-3’, which supported the position of one methoxyl at C-5’, the allyl group at C-1’ and aromatic ring at C-7. Additional cross-peaks in the HMBC spectrum gave support to the proposed structure for compound 1 (Figure 1). ESI(+)-MS/MS experiments for the protonated molecule of m/z 357 with dissociation induced by collisions with argon provides further structural characterization as dissociation forms major ionic fragments of m/z 316 (24), 341 (8), and 301 (22) owing to the losses of an allyl, methyl and allyl plus methyl radicals, in addition to a fragment ion of m/z 151 (9), assigned to the dimethoxytropilium ion. Additionally, the protonated 1, of m/z 357, dissociates by the loss of a neutral molecule of 1,2-dimethoxybenzene to yield the ion of m/z 219 (Figure 2), which likely rearranges to form an acylium ion that subsequently loses a neutral C3H4 allene to yield an ion of m/z 179. Additional data from a LRMS experiment showed the base peak of m/z 179 and peaks at 357, 325, 316 and 219 (see Experimental section), which gave support to the structure proposed for compound 1. These data are fully consistent with the new bicyclooctane neolignan 1, which is therefore assigned as (7S*, 8R*, 1’R*, 3’R*)-3,4,5’-trimethoxy-3,7’-cyclo-8,1’-neolig-8’-ene- 2,4’(3’H)-dione. Compound 2 was identified as the bicycle [3.2.1]octane neolignan piperol B and compound 3, as the benzofuran neolignan burchellin, previously isolated from Piper betle and Aniba burchelli, respectively.19,20 Compound 2 is a guianin type and compound 3 is a porosin type neolignan and their identification was based on extensive analyses of NMR data as well as on comparison with literature data for guianin, porosin and ferrearin type neolignans, which are widely distributed in Lauraceae species.21 The antiradicalar activity of compounds 1-6 has been evaluated towards the stable free radical DPPH, which exhibits an absorption maximum at 517 nm, evidencing prominent activities of compounds 4-6 (Figure 3) and poor activities for compounds 1-3. The absence of phenolic hydroxyls in the latter renders them less effective in promoting DPPH reduction, therefore appearing as poor radical scavengers. The free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids and other phenols is mostly due to their aromatic hydroxy groups, which confer great stability to the phenolic radical as soon it is formed, after one hydrogen radical donation to DPPH. The stronger activity of compound 5 when compared to compounds 4 and 6 is probably due to the catechol moiety in the B ring of quercetrin along with its extended conjugation through the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system on the C ring, which are some of the major structural features associated with antioxidant activity of flavonoids.22 The comparison with standard compound rutin (∆A=81% at 50 µmol L-1) evidences the reported major roles of some structural Figure 3.

HPLC separations were performed on a Waters Prep LC 4000 System and C-18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns (4.6 mm and 20mm i.d. for analytical and preparative columns, respectively) and pre-columns were used. All solvents (Merck or Malinckrodt) were of analytical or HPLC grade. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. Low resolution ESI(+)-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. High resolution ESI(+)-MS analysis were performed on a hybrid double quadrupole (Qq) and orthogonal time-of-flight (Tof) mass spectrometer (Qtof, Micromass UK) operating at 7.000 resolution and mass accuracy of 10 ppm. The temperature of the nebulizer was 50 °C. The ESI and mass spectrometer were operated in the positive ion mode. The cone and extractor potential were set to 40 and 0 V, respectively. The m/z scan range was from 50 up to 1000. Tandem mass spectrometric [ESI(+)- MS/MS] experiments were performed using the product ion scan mode via Q1 mass selection of the desirable product ion, q2 collision-induced dissociation (CID) with N2, and orthogonal TOF mass analysis of the CID ionic fragments. The collision energy ranged from 15 to 25 eV, depending on the dissociation lability of the precursor ion. Plant material Nectandra grandiflora leaves were collected in Jureia- Itatins State Park, Atlantic Forest, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Ines Cordeiro. The voucher specimens (number: Moraes 05) were deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Botânica- SEMA, SP, Brazil. Extraction and isolation Dried and ground leaves (2.0 kg) were extracted with ethanol at r.t. and afforded a dark green EtOH extract (5.0 g) after solvent evaporation under vacuum. Partition of the EtOH extract with organic solvents gave the hexane (0.6g), CHCl3 (1.6 g), EtOAc (0.5 g) and hydroalcoholic (2.3 g) extracts after solvent evaporation. MPLC on silica gel of the CHCl3 extract (1.6 g, hexane/EtOAc gradient) gave 15 pooled fractions (A1-A15). Fraction A2 (41.0 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/acetone/HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound 2 (12.2 mg). Fraction A3 (32.1 mg), obtained from the elution with hexane/EtOAc 4:1, was further purified by preparative TLC (CHCl3/acetone/ HOAc 90:9:1) and gave compound 1 (6.8 mg). Fraction A6 (88.1 mg) was recrystallized in MeOH to afford compound 3 (25.5 mg). CC on Sephadex LH-20 of the EtOAc fraction (200.0 mg) eluted with MeOH resulted in 42 subfractions which were pooled after TLC analysis (B1- B4). Fr. B2 (38.7 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/HOAc 79:18:2:1) and gave compound 4 (7.1 mg). Purification of fraction B3 (45.1 mg) by preparative TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 36:12:1:1) afforded compound 5 (14.0 mg). The hydroalcoholic fraction (200.0 mg) was submitted to CC on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH resulting in 10 fractions (C1- C10). Purification of fraction C-8 (37.7 mg) by RP-HPLC (C18 Luna-Phenomenex column, MeOH/H2O/ HOAc 55:43:2, 8 mL min-1, detection at 280 nm) gave compound 6 (8.1 mg). Bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates Samples were eluted on TLC plates which were then dried and sprayed with 0.02% solution of β-carotene (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates are placed under natural light until discoloration of background. The remaining yellow spots indicate the presence of antioxidants.13 Reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) The free radical scavenging capacities of the isolates and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated from their ability to reduce the free radical 2,2-diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 mL) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 µmol L-1 to 100 µmol L-1were then prepared in methanol and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated as ∆A= (Ao-A)/Ao.11, 14 (7S*,8R*,1’R*,3’R*)-3,4,5’-trimethoxy-3,7’-cyclo- 8,1’-neolig-8’-ene-2,4’(3’H)-dione (1).

O mutualismo entre o fungo e as formigas é um ponto a ser explorado quando se considera sua possível aplicação em métodos alternativos para o controle desses insetos. Sabendo- se que algumas plantas são naturalmente resistentes aos insetos fitófagos, alguns produtos naturais (metabólitos secundários) devem ser avaliados em relação às suas propriedades inseticidas e/ou fungicidas. Neste trabalho foram isoladas oito cumarinas de quatro espécies de plantas e o efeito no desenvolvimento do fungo simbionte das formigas cortadeiras Atta sexdens foi determinado. Com exceção da clausarina, todas as outras cumarinas foram inibitórias de 64 µg mL-1 à 80 µg mL-1 sendo que a xantiletina inibiu o fungo na concentração de 25 µg mL-1. Leaf-cutting ants are known to be a serious pest for agriculture due to the high amounts of vegetal matter from crops used by them in order to cultivate a symbiotic fungus on which they rely for food and enzymes. The mutualism between the fungus and the ants is a point to be explored when alternative methods of control are being thought of. Considering that some plants are naturally resistant to phytophagous insects, some natural products (secondary metabolites) should be evaluated with respect to their insecticide and/or fungicide properties. In this paper we isolated eight coumarins from four different plant species and we determined their effect on the development of the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens. With the exception of clausarin, all the other coumarins were inhibitory from 64 µg mL-1 through 80 µg mL-1 and xanthyletin inhibited the fungus at 25 µg mL-1 Keywords: leaf-cutting ants, coumarins, symbiotic fungus inhibition Introduction Leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores in the tropics, can be found from the Southern United States to Northern Argentina.1 They cultivate a symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, thus damaging agriculture.2 It is known that plants have several mechanisms to avoid herbivores, including a set of toxic chemicals.3 The presence of secondary plant metabolites toxic to the ants and/or to their symbiotic fungi may play an important role in whether the ants will cut such plants or not.4 Many of the most important crops cultivated in our country are exotic species, which have not had the possibility of co-evolution with predators and as such are preferentially attacked.5 Different methods have been proposed for the control of these ants (organophosporus, pyrethroids and sulfluramid insecticides). However, problems with non-target animals, high chemical stability and environmental contamination are common and it is necessary to continue looking for new strategies to control these insects.6 The search for specific compounds directed against these ants and their microbial partners has been the focus of our studies during the past years and natural chemicals isolated from a variety of plant species were effective against the ants and inhibited the growth of their symbiotic fungus or both.6-15 Among the several biological properties of coumarins we can find dermal photosensitising, estrogenic, antimicrobial, vasodilator, molluscicidal, antihelmintic, 670 Godoy et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. sedative and hypnotic, analgesic and hypothermic activities,16,17 but they have been associated mainly with anticoagulant activity.18 Indeed, they are widely found in several botanical families such as Rutaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Moraceae and Thymeleaceae and it seems to correlate with their action as phytoalexins. Repellent action to beetles and other terrestrial invertebrates and the inhibition of both sporulation and the growth of some fungal plant pathogens by some coumarins were described by Weinmann.19 The aim of this study was to analyze the activity of eight coumarins isolated from different plant species on the development of the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Experimental Preparation and fractioning of crude extracts Different parts of plants were ground to powder, dried at 40 °C and percolated with a set of organic solvents (hexane, dichloromethane and methanol) during 72 hours three times each at room temperature for three days, followed by the evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure at 40 °C. The crude extracts were fractionated through flash chromatography under vacuum with silica gel and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol). They were then purified through different techniques including column chromatography, preparative TLC and HPLC. Coumarins Angelicin (1), suberosin (2), xanthoxyletin (3) and clausarin (4) were isolated from the methanol extract of the roots of Citrus limonia. Isopimpinellin (5) was isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the roots of Adiscanthus fusciflorus Ducke. Umbelliferone (6) was isolated from the hydroalcoholic extract of the barks of Picramnia teapensis, xanthyletin (7) and 7-hydroxy-3- (1´1´-dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (8) were isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the stems of Pilocarpus riedelianus. All the coumarins were identified through spectrometric techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS and IR and compared to literature data for (1); 20 (2); 21-23 (3);22, 24 (4); 22 (5); 22, 23, 25-27 (6); 28 (7); 28, 29 (8).30 Fungus The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Singer) Möller (syn Rozites gongylophorus) was isolated from a laboratory nest of Atta sexdens L. The medium for fungus maintenance and methods for the bioassays were previously described.10 One mL of dichloromethane solution of each coumarin was added to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose, 10.0; sodium chloride, 5.0; peptone, 5.0; malt extract, 10.0 and agar, 15.0. Control tubes received 1.0 mL of dichloromethane and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes were autoclaved at 121 oC by 15 min and then slanted. The final concentration of each coumarin in µg mL-1 was: 1=72; 2=64; 3= 70; 4=75; 5=80; 6=65; 7=25 and 8=75. The fungal suspension was prepared by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1 g L–1) and gently fragmented. One mL of this suspension was spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at 25(±1) oC for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two sets of five tubes each). Controls with and without solvent as well as with PBO (9) (commercial piperonil butoxide – Pirisa Piretro Industrial, 97LO106IO) were run simultaneously. Fungal growth was estimated macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and density using the modal value. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of the isolated coumarins and on Table 1 we can see the effects of the coumarins on the fungal growth. Except for clausarin (4), which had no effect on the fungal development at a concentration of 75 µg mL-1, all the others inhibited the fungus at different degrees. Thus, at 72 µg mL-1, angelicin (1) was responsible for a moderate (40%) inhibition of fungal growth whereas an inhibition of 60% was achieved with umbelliferone (6) at 65 µg mL-1. Strong inhibition (80% at 75 µg mL-1) was observed with 7-hydroxy-3-(1’,1’- dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (8) and total inhibition of fungal growth was observed with suberosin (2), xanthoxyletin (3) and isopimpinellim (5) at concentrations ranging from 64 to 80 µg mL-1. Unfortunately, we did not have enough material to determine whether suberosin, xanthoxyletin and isopimpinellim could be inhibitory at a lower concentration. Victor31 had shown total inhibition of the fungus in the presence of xanthyletin (7) at concentrations of 100 and 50 µg mL-1. The same effect was now observed at 25 µg mL-1 showing that this compound should be better evaluated in respect to its potential in the control of these insects. 671 Inhibition of the Symbiotic Fungus of Leaf-Cutting Ants by Coumarins Vol. 16, No. 3B, 2005 Five out of the eight coumarins assayed were isolated from the roots of Citrus limonia and Adiscanthus fusciflorus. Natural coumarins are synthesized by plants as a response to injury during the wilting process, diseases or drying and accumulate on the surface of leaves, fruits and seeds. According to Ojala32 their presence in the roots may provide a tool against microbial invasion. Attempts to correlate structure and antimicrobial activity of coumarins were made by some authors. Kayser and Kolodziej33 reported that highly oxygenated coumarins and the positions of the polar hydroxyls and of the less polar methoxy groups on the aromatic nucleus are important for antibacterial activity. Yet, according to Dini et al. (apud Sardari et al.34) the occurrence of the aromatic hydroxy group and/or ether or ester groups at positions 6 or 7 of the basic structure are important for antifungal action. For them, alkylated derivatives of 7- hydroxycoumarins can have both antifungal and antibacterial properties. On the other hand, Sardari et al.34 did not find antifungal activity of coumarins with a hydroxy group at position 7, as observed with umbelliferone, which showed low activity against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus niger but they found a relationship between antifungal activity and the presence of free 6–OH and 6–OMe. The results of Sardari et al.34 were confirmed by Ojala et al.35 with C. albicans, A. niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae but not for the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium culmorum to which umbelliferone was highly inhibitory. So, if some structure-activity relationship can be made, the hypothesis about a possible species-specific activity cannot be discarded. Except for clausarin (4) our results showed that the seven linear coumarins assayed inhibited the symbiotic fungus of A. sexdens at low concentrations whereas a low inhibition was achieved with angelicin. Since angelicin was the only angular coumarin assayed in this work it was not possible to establish at this moment any relationship between antifungal activity and linearity. Also the occurrence of prenyl and MeO groups linked to the basic structure of coumarins should be better studied in order to determine if they are important or not for the antifungal activity described here.

Cardoso, Dulce H. S. Silva, Ian Castro-Gamboa and Vanderlan da S. Bolzani* Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista CP 355, 14800-900 Araraquara-SP, Brazil Um novo biflavonol denominado chimarrosídeo (1) e oito flavonóis glicosilados adicionais (2-9) foram isolados das folhas de Chimarrhis turbinata. Suas estruturas foram elucidadas com base nos dados dos experimentos de RMN 1D e 2D, como: 3-O-rutinosilquercetina (2), 3-O- rutinosil-kaempferol (3), 3-O-galactopiranosil-(6→1)-ramnopiranosil kaempferol (4), 3-O-β- galactopiranosil-(6→1)-α-ramnopiranosil-quercetina (5), 6-hidroxirutina (6), 3-O- galactopiranosil-kaempferol (7), 3-O-glucopiranosil-kaempferol (8) e 3-O-ramnopiranosil- (6→1)-glucopiranosil-(4→1)-ramnopiranosil-kaempferol (9). Adicionalmente, a catequina (10) e a procianidina B-3 (catequina-(4α→8)-catequina) (11) também foram isoladas. O extrato bruto, frações e compostos isolados foram avaliados quanto às suas propriedades antioxidantes no teste em CCD aspergida com solução de β-caroteno, e teste espectrofotométrico utilizando o radical livre 1,1-difenil-2-picrilidrazila (DPPH). Os flavonóides 2, 5, 6, 10 e 11 apresentaram forte atividade antioxidante quando comparados com os padrões BHT e rutina. A new biflavonol, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonol glycosides (2-9), were isolated from the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata. Their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (4), quercetin-3-O- α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside (5), 6-hydroxy-rutin (6), kaempferol-3- O-D-galactopyranoside (7), kaempferol-3-O-D-glucopyranoside (8) and kaempferol-3-O-α-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranoside (9). In addition, catechin (10) and catechin-(4α→8)-catechin-procyanidin B-3) (11) were isolated. The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative properties using an autographic assay based on β-carotene bleaching on TLC plates, and spectrophotometric detection by reduction of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Flavonoids 2, 5, 6, 10 and 11 displayed strong free radical scavenging activity, when compared with the standards BHT and rutin. Keywords: Rubiaceae, chimarrhoside, DPPH, β-carotene Introduction In recent years, flavonoids have been widely recognized as a major class of secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties due to their ability to scavenge free radicals.1-3 Antioxidant is a broad classification for molecules that may act prior to, or during, a free radical chain reaction at initiation, propagation, termination, decomposition, or subsequent reaction of oxidation products as sensitive targets.4 There are several diseases, whose causes and severity are linked to oxidation, mainly those associated with oxygen free radicals, which have been implicated as mediators of degenerative and chronic deteriorative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases,5 such as rheumatoid arthritis,6 diabetes, vascular disease and hypertension, cancer and hyperplasic diseases,7 cataract formation and aging processes.8 Radical-mediated pathologies such as ischemia reperfusion, asthma and many others involving an imbalance in pro-oxidant- antioxidant processes.9 In our search for antioxidant compounds from Amazonian plant species, we examined constituents of Chimarrhis turbinata DC Rodr.. (Rubiaceae) leaves, collected in the city of Belém, Pará State, Brazil. The chemical composition of C. turbinata has been studied previously, and bioactive indole alkaloids were identified.10-12 In this paper, we describe the isolation 1354 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. of a new biflavonoid, named chimarrhoside (1), and eight known flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant effects, which were deduced by electrochemical detection coupled to an HPLC system, bleaching of β-carotene on TLC plates, and parameters related to the evaluation of antioxidant activity measured by free radical scavenging ability towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl). Results and Discussion Chimarrhoside (1) was obtained as an amorphous pale yellow powder from the EtOH extract and exhibited in its mass spectrum a molecular ion peak at m/z 1171 [M+H]+ obtained from ESIMS. The IR and UV spectra of 1 revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm-1) and phenolic groups (270, 295, 344 nm, 1690 cm-1). Part of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of compound 1 were observed in duplicate, suggesting a dimer (Table 1). Comparison of the 13C NMR values of 1 with literature data13 evidenced the kaempferol aglycone and additional similar spectral features to those of 3, also isolated in this work, except for the duplication of some signals for carbons arising from a dimer structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 1, signals for two kaempferol units as two meta-coupled A-ring hydrogens (H-6/H-8) and two pairs of coupled B-ring hydrogens (H-3'/H-5' and H-2'/H-6') for each aglycone were observed, in addition to four anomeric hydrogens at δ 5.12 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 5.02 (1H, d, J 7.7 Hz), 4.40 (1H, br s), 4.60 (1H, br s), 20 hydroxymethine and 2 hydroxymethylene hydrogens. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of two kaempferol moieties and 24 hydroxymethine and hydroxymethylene signals which, analyzed together with 1H NMR data (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of two diglycoside moieties identified as rutinosyl and α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- (1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. This assumption was supported by signals at δ 103.1 / 67.1 and δ 104.0 / 65.9, assigned to C-1'’ C-6'’ of the glucopyranosyl and of the galactopyranosyl moiety respectively. Those signals also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’ (anomeric) and H-6'’ (Table 1); as well as signals at δ 100.9/16.4 and δ 100.4/16.6, assigned to C-1’’’/C-6’’’ of the two rhamnopyranosil moieties, respectively, which also showed HMQC correlations with H-1'’’ (δ 4.4 0 and 4.60) and H-6’’’ (δ 1.17 and 1.11). On the basis of the above data, the chemical shifts assigned for each sugar: the glucosyl and galactosyl moieties were confirmed taking into account the values at δ 103.1, 76.6, 75.7, 74.3, 70.1 and 67.1 as well as δ 104.0, 73.9, 73.6, 71.5, 68.2 and 65.9 attributed to glucose and galactose, respectively.15 According to literature data, using the same solvent, the chemical shifts of hydroxymethines carbons in glucose are quite deshielded when compared to those of galactose. The glucosyl/galactosyl groups are linked to the rhamnosyl residue at C-6”, because the signal assigned to this carbon, in both sugar moieties, was markedly displaced downfield at δ 67.1/65.9 (∆δ +6), respectively when compared with the 13C NMR spectrum of free hydroxymethylenes in glucose/galactose. This also was confirmed by the observation of a HMBC long-range correlation of the anomeric hydrogen signal of the rhamnosyl group at δ 4.40 / 4.60 with C-6” of the glucosyl moieties at 67.1 and 65.9, respectively. Additionally, the site of glycosylation at C-3 of each kaempferol moiety was evidenced from downfield shifts of C-2 (∆δ +9) and C-4 (∆δ +2) and upfield shift of C-3 (∆δ -3) when compared to the aglycone,15 as well as from HMBC correlations of H-1'’ to C-3a/3b within each kaempferol diglycoside moiety (Figure 1). Further HMBC correlations of H-6 and H-8 with C-7 (δ 164.6) confirmed the assignments for ring A and suggested the interflavonoidic linkage at C-7 due to the observed downfield shift of its signal when compared to the monomer.15 Moreover, ESIMS analysis showed peaks of m/z 298 (70) and 133 (40) resulting from Retro Diels- Alder (RDA) fragmentations. From moiety A wherein bonds 1 and 3 undergo scission, lead to formation of ions I and II as well as scission of bonds 0 and 2 led to the formation of fragment m/z 433 (30). The fragment m/z 298 (70), was generated by both RDA suffered by moiety A and moiety B (Figure 2). Additional fragments observed in the mass spectra are in accordance with those reported for kaempferol.16 These data, combined with HPLC analysis, which showed a lower retention time for compound 1 (5.7 min) when compared to monomeric flavonol diglycosides 2 (9.8 min) and 3 (13.8 min.) (Figure 3), confirmed the proposed structure for compound 1 as kaempferol 3-O-β-rutinosyl-(7α→O→7β)-kaempferol-3- O-β-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-galactopyranoside. Further studies of the EtOAc extract from leaves of C. turbinata resulted in 10 known flavonoids already reported in the literature: Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol- 3-O-rutinoside (3), kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamno- Figure 1.

These compounds were identified and their structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments and compared with literature data (Figure 4).13-15, 18, 19-22, 26-28 The radical scavenging effects obtained for compounds 2-11 assayed with DPPH are shown in (Table 2) using as reference the antioxidant standard rutin (IC50 21.34 μg mL-1) and BHT (IC50 62.50 μg mL-1). These results indicate that the free-radical scavenging activity of these 1356 Cardoso et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. micromolecules is due to its hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the ease of stabilization of the phenoxyl radical after reduction of DPPH and is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by the IC50 values for compounds 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11.24 It is also evident from Table 2, that ortho-dihydroxy moiety plays more important role for this type of activity than the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, as the lack of the latter, e.g. in compound 10, contributed in a lesser extent to the loss of activity, as observed for compounds 3, 4 and 7-9, due to the missing catechol group.

Experimental General experimental procedures Commercial β-carotene (Aldrich) and DPPH (Aldrich) were used in the antioxidant assays. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C and referenced to the residual proton solvent resonance (CD3OD at δ 3.33 and 49.0 for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively). IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR-Nicolet, model EMACT-40 Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrophotometer, in the range 500-4000 cm-1. ESIMS spectra were acquired using an ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10-20 eV with argon. Silica gel 60H (230-400 μ), (60-230 μ) (Merck), Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) and XAD-16 (Sigma) were used in column chromatography. TLC plates were illuminated under UV light at 254 and 366 nm. For preparative HPLC, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, ODS Phenomenex,, Luna column (250 x 21.20 mm, 5 μm), and pre-Column (50 x 10.00 mm) were used in this study. For semi-preparative HPLC, a Supelco ODS column 8 (250 mm x 10 mm x 5 μm) was used. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All EIMS spectra were obtained by direct insertion of the samples, using an electric cone potential of +70 eV. Plant material Leaves from C. turbinata DC Rodr. were collected at the Viro Reserve, in the State of Pará, in October 1996 and February 2000. Dr. Inês Cordeiro identified the specimen, and a voucher No. Cord-2367 was deposited in the Herbarium of the São Paulo Botanic Garden, São Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation C. turbinata were collected twice, and the plant material obtained (1.0 kg), were dried, powdered and extracted with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v) and EtOH, successively, affording extracts A and B, respectively, after solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. Extract B was dissolved in MeOH:H2O (80:20) and partitioned with hexane. The hydroalcoholic fraction was partially evaporated to MeOH:H2O (60:40), and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. All fractions were preliminarily screened with β-carotene solution on TLC for antioxidant compounds. The EtOAc fraction (1.0 g after solvent evaporation) was dissolved in MeOH (5.0 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-1 to A-12. Fraction A-5 (160.0 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with MeOH and the obtained subfractions were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-5-I, A-5-II and A-5-III. Fraction A-5-II was purified by HPLC [Phenomenex ODS, 250 x 21.2 mm, 10 μm; eluent: MeOH-H2O (2:3, v/v); 12.0 mL min-1; UV detection at 280 nm] affording compounds 2 (7.0 mg), 3 (16.0 mg) and 4 (12.0 mg). Fraction A-6 (63.1 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over9 Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH. The subfractions obtained were compared by TLC analysis and pooled into fractions A-6-I, A-6-II and A-6-III. Fraction A-6-I (25.0 mg) was purified by LC over polivinylpirrolidone (PVPP)25 eluted with MeOH affording the new compound 1 (2.6 mg). Leaves of C. turbinata (powdered and air-dried material 1.2 kg) obtained from the second collection were extracted exhaustively with EtOH at room temperature. The EtOH solutions were evaporated under vacuum to give a residue (57.1 g). This residue was dissolved in EtOH:H2O (90:10), and then extracted with n-hexane to give a n-hexane fraction (28.9 g). The EtOH:H2O fraction was extracted with CH2Cl2, EtOAc and n-BuOH successively, to give a CH2Cl2 fraction (4.0 g), EtOAc fraction (4.1 g), n-BuOH fraction (12.4 g) and H2O-soluble residues (7.6 g), respectively, which were screened by β-carotene test on TLC.

The n-BuOH fraction (12.3 g) was fractionated by LC over XAD-4, using H2O, MeOH:H2O gradient 20-100%, acetone, MeOH:CH2Cl2 (1:1, v/v), CH2Cl2 and Et2O (750.0 mL each) as eluents and afforded fractions XAD-1 to XAD-11. Fraction XAD-2 (700.0 mg) was submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH as eluent and afforded 23 fractions. Fraction XAD-2-II (90.0 mg), was purified by preparative HPLC [ODS, MeCN:H2O:AcOH (15:84.95:0.05), 12.0 mL min-1, UV detection at 280 nm], and resulted in the isolation of flavonoid 9 (1.8 mg). β-Carotene bleaching experiments TLC plates, after elution and drying, were sprayed with a solution of β-carotene (Aldrich) (0.02%) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of background was observed. The persisting yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.17 Determination of the radical scavenging activity 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was used in methanol (100 μmol L-1). 2. 0 mL of the reagent was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds, previously dissolved in methanol, with yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 and 5 μmol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and maintained for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin and BHT were used as standard compounds. DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in methanol (1.0 mL) served as control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer at 517 nm and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH treated control group.

Entre eles, a 1,2-diidro-3β-hidroxi-7-desacetoxi-7-oxogedunina é uma substância inédita. Além disso, alguns deslocamentos químicos da xilocensina k foram corrigidos e os dados de RMN 1H da 7-desacetilgedunina são descritos pela primeira vez na literatura. Seis dos limonóides isolados foram submetidos a ensaios com formigas Atta sexdens rubropilosa e apresentaram atividade inseticida moderada. Nine limonoids were isolated from Carapa guianensis and Cedrela fissilis. Among them, 1,2-dihydro-3β-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin is a new compound. Moreover, the assignments of some chemical shifts of xyloccensin k have been corrected and 1H NMR data of 7-deacetylgedunin have been assigned for the first time. These isolated limonoids were assayed on Atta sexdens rubropilosa workers showing moderate insecticidal activities. Keywords: Meliaceae, Carapa guianensis, Cedrela fissilis, limonoids, insecticidal activity Introduction The family Meliaceae includes many plants that are sources of valuable timber and many that have wide- ranging uses in ethnomedicine. The family is distinguished by the occurrence of characteristic substances called limonoids.1 These substances have wide spectrum of biological activities,2 particularly insecticidal action.3 The leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex use mostly fresh plant fragments to raise their symbiotic fungi4,5 and are the cause of considerable economic damage, due to defoliation that they cause.6 Control of this pest is still problematic, presenting only temporary effects and is sometimes, harmful to the environment, to man and other animals.6,7 Consequently, an extensive search for alternate methods to control these insects has been made in an attempt to substitute traditional agrochemicals with agents that yield faster decay, higher specificity and, therefore, less damaging to the environment. In this context, plants are considered a promising source for less toxic compounds that could be used as a soft control method. As a part of our search for new natural insecticides against leaf-cutting ants8 and because of the fact that limonoids have displayed biological activity towards a variety of insects, we decided to investigate the effect of limonoids isolated from two species of Meliaceae family, Carapa guianensis Aubl. and Cedrela fissilis Vell. on Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Carapa guianensis is a tall tree that grows wild throughout South America, West India and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in areas of the Amazon rainforest, that are rich in soils and swamps. From the nuts of this plant is extracted an oil, called andiroba oil, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, such as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, anti-parasitic and as an anti-cancer remedy.9-12 Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic and linoleic acids, together with 2-5% of unsaponificable material. In addition, from several parts of Carapa guianensis have been isolated limonoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, flavonoids and diglycerides.13-18 C. fissilis tree, known as “cedro” (cedar), is a valuable source of timber. In Brazil, it can be found from the Amazon forest as far south as Espírito Santo State. Previous investigation of fruits and seeds from this species 543 Limonoids from Andiroba Oil and Cedrela fissilis and their Insecticidal Activity Vol. 17, No. 3, 2006 afforded the limonoids fissinolide, mexicanolide and 3β-hydroxyisomexicanolide.19 Extracts and fractions from C. fissilis and one commercial C. guianensis oil showed to have activity against A. sexdens rubropilosa workers.20,21 In the herein study we report the insecticidal activities towards A. sexdens rubropilosa of six gedunin derivatives limonoids obtained from these active fractions besides spectroscopic data for 1,2-dihydro-3β-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), 7-deacetylgedunin (6) and xyloccensin k (9). Results and Discussion The chemical investigation of one commercial andiroba oil sample afforded seven limonoids: 17β-hydroxyazadiradione (1), gedunin (2), 6α-acetoxy- gedunin (3), 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (4), 1,2-dihydro- 3β-hydroxy-7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), methyl angolensate (8) and xyloccensin k (9). Moreover, from roots and leaves of C. fissilis were isolated 7-deacetyl- gedunin (6) and photogedunin (7) along with limonoids 2, 3, 4 and 5. Compounds 1, 2 and 9 have been isolated for the first time from C. guianensis and all the limonoids isolated from C. fissilis are new for this species. Compound 5 is new to the literature. Limonoids 1,22 2,23 3,13 4,15 7,24 and 825 were identified by comparison of their NMR spectral data to those previously reported in the literature. The 1H NMR data of compound 6 (Table 1) supplement and expand some hydrogen and carbon chemical shifts reported by Ekong and Olagbemi.26 Compound 5 was isolated as a white powder from C. fissilis leaves and from andiroba oil and identified by spectroscopic methods. It is a new compound, whose 3-OH epimer was obtained from Guarea thompsonii.27 The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 5 exhibited signals at: δH 7.40 (m), 7.36 (m), 6.36 (s) and δC 143.0, 141.0, 120.4, 109.9 of a β-furanyl ring; δH 1.13 (s), 1.12 (s), 1.08 (s), 0.98 (s), 0.84 (s) and δC 27.4, 20.9, 17.1, 16.9, 14.8 related to five tert-methyl groups; δH 5.45 (s), 3.83 (s) and δC 167.3, 65.7, 53.6, 78.1 corresponding to a lactone D-ring with an epoxide between C-14 and C-15. These features are characteristics of compounds classified in the gedunin group of limonoids. However, the NMR spectra of compound 5 lacked signals related to the A-ring α,β-insaturated ketone. In contrast, signals were observed at δH 3.26 (dd, 11.0 and 5.0 Hz) and δC 78.2. These signals indicated an equatorial hydroxyl group at C-3. Thus, limonoid 5 was identified as 1,2-dihydro-3β-hydroxy-7- deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and its spectral data allocations (Table 1) were established unequivocally through 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Compound 9 was isolated as a white powder from andiroba oil. It is classified as belonging to the mexicanolide group of limonoids and contains a tetrahydrofuran sub-unit with an oxygen bridge linking from C-3 to C-8. It was also isolated from the seed of Xylocarpus granatum.28 However, we found through 2D NMR spectra analysis that some chemical shifts were incorrectly determined by Kokpol et al.,28 among them H-17, H-28, H-29, C-8, C-17, C-18 and C-29. The chemical shift of C-17 was deduced from 1J correlation between H-17 (δ 6.28, s) and one carbon at δ 76.5. H-18 (δ 1.00, s) was assigned through 3J correlation between the methyl hydrogens and carbinolic carbon at δ 76.5 (C-17). Furthermore, H-28 (δ 1.12) and H-29 (δ 0.67) were determined through 3J correlation to C-3 (δ 91.4). Finally, the 2J-3J correlations among H-30 (δ 2.52, dd, 12.4 and 6.1 Hz), H-2 (δ 2.98, br t, 6.1 Hz) and a quaternary carbon at δ 85.2 established C-8. Some of the limonoids isolated from C. guianensis and C. fissilis were evaluated for their effects on A. sexdens rupropilosa ants. The results (Table 3) showed that control and limonoid-treated groups had on average the same Table 1.

The gedunin type limonoids do not seem to be highly active against these ants. Indeed, C-seco limonoids, such as azadirachtin, are more active insecticidal compound, possessing both antifeedant and growth-regulating activities.2,29 The toxicity for the ants observed for the C. fissilis and C. guianensis extracts seems not to be related only to the presence of the limonoids. Perhaps the limonoids act in synergism between them or with other compounds in the extracts. Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlation spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using Bruker DRX-200 and ARX- 400 NMR spectrometers, and using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. HPLC was carried out using a preparative LC-8A Shimadzu system with SPD-6AV Shimadzu UV detector. Plant material The roots and leaves of Cedrela fissilis Vell. were collected in São Carlos-SP, Brazil in June 01, 2001 and identified by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, where a voucher specimen (6701) was deposited. The commercial andiroba oil sample was purchased in Belém city (Pará, Brazil), in 1996. Isolation of the limonoids from Carapa guianensis A portion of andiroba oil sample (21.0 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH gradient, to yield the four corresponding fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (2.6 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 267 x 38 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane→MeOH gradient) to give three fractions. The second fraction (Ac2; 2.3 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 264 x 45 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity Table 2.

Fraction FA (19.0 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 309 x 38 mm i.d., stepwise with a hexane:CH2Cl2:acetone→MeOH gradient) to give nine fractions. Several chromatographies of fractions five, seven and eight (FA5, FA7 and FA8) afforded limonoids 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, as described below. The fifth fraction (FA5; 1.1 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 269 x 32 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2:acetone→MeOH) to afford nine fractions. The limonoids 2 (FA5,6,4; 4.5 mg) and 3 (FA5,6,3; 1.5 mg) were isolated from fraction six (FA5,6; 30.1 mg) by preparative HPLC (Asahipak GS-310 2G polymeric column, 500 x 22 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH (100%), flow rate: 5 mL min-1, detector UV at 220 nm). Fraction seven (FA7; 338.4 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 466 x 24 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2:acetone→MeOH) to afford seven fractions.

Through preparative HPLC (Asahipak GS-310 2G polymeric column, 500 x 22 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH (100%), flow rate: 5 mL min-1, detector UV at 220 nm) of fraction two (FA7,4,2; 38.9 mg) were isolated the limonoids 4 (FA7,4,2,3; 5.8 mg) and 8 (FA7,4,2,4; 17.4 mg). Fraction eight (FA8; 342.9 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230-400 mesh, 342 x 24 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane:CH2Cl2:acetone→MeOH) to afford six fractions. The fourth fraction (FA8,4; 195.4 mg) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh, 473 x 24 mm i.d.) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2:acetone→MeOH) to yield nine fractions. Limonoid 1 (FA8,4,6,2; 6.6 mg) was isolated from fraction six (FA8,4,6; 15.3 mg) through preparative HPLC (Hypersil 5m column, 290 x 10 mm i.d., eluted with hexane:isopropanol (9:1), flow rate: 3 mL min-1, detector UV at 240 nm). Isolation of the limonoids from Cedrela fissilis The powdered air-dried roots from C. fissilis were extracted by maceration for three times (72 h) with hexane, dichloromethane and and/or methanol at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. A portion of the hexane extract (3.5 g) from roots of C. fissilis (RH) was submitted to VLC on silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (704 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (230- 400 mesh), and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1) to give 5 fractions (A→E). Fraction E was twice chromatographed as above to give four fractions. Fraction E-4 was submitted to HPLC [Asahipak GS-310 2G polymeric column, 500 x 22 mm i.d., eluted with MeOH (100%), at a flow rate of 5 mL min-1, detector UV at 254 nm] affording 2 (13.1 mg) and 3 (2.5 mg). The powdered air-dried leaves from C. fissilis were extracted by maceration as described above. The CH2Cl2 extract (29.0 g) from leaves of C. fissilis (LH) was submitted to VLC as described to the hexane extract from roots (RH). The CH2Cl2-soluble fraction (6.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (70-230 mesh)-florisil (1:1), with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient to afford 9 fractions (A→I). Fraction D was three times chroma- tographed with hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3.5:0.5) to give 4 (8.3 mg) and 6 (5.1 mg). Fraction I was also chromatographed three times over silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (7:2:1) yielding 9 fractions. Fraction I-3 was purified by HPLC [Hypersil 5 μ column, 290 x 10 mm i.d., eluted with hexane:isopropanol (8:2), flow rate: 2.5 mL min-1, Table 3.

Bioassays The A. sexdens rubropilosa workers used in the assays were randomly removed from laboratory nests. They had a combined body mass of 20-25 mg. Before assaying the nests were supplied daily with leaves of Eucalyptus sp., oat seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such as Hibiscus sp., Ligustrum sp. or rose petals. Fifty ants were randomly removed from the nests and distributed to five Petri dishes (ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assays the ants were maintained on an artificial diet consisting of glucose (50 g L-1), bacto-peptone (10 g L-1), yeast extract (1.0 g L-1) and agar (15 g L -1) in distilled water (100 mL).30 The diets (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of limonoids (experiment) or without (control) were supplemented daily in small plastic caps. The control was prepared with the diet and the solvent. The compounds were poured into the hot diet immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration of the limonoids added to the diet was 100 μg mL-1. To ensure that undetectable remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants, a comparison was made with another set of dishes in which water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not shown). During the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at a temperature of 25 (±1) oC and relative humidity ranging between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation was 25 days and the number of dead ants was recorded daily. The survival average 50% (S50) was calculated and survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted software Graph-Pad TM using the log-rank test. Figure 1.

(Rutaceae) levou ao isolamento de alcalóides furoquinolínicos (dictamina, g-fagarina e esquimianina) e 2-arilquinolin- 4-ona (2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona) e limonóides (ácido limonéxico e limonina). Os compostos 2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona e ácido limonéxico foram isolados pela primeira vez no gênero Spiranthera. Os alcalóides furoquinolínicos, 2-arilquinolin-4-ona e os limonóides mostraram atividade inseticida e/ou fungicida no ninho da formiga Atta sexdens rubropilosa. The study of the Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil (Rutaceae) branches extracts led to the isolation of the furoquinoline (dictamine, g-fagarine and skimmianine) and 2-arylquinoli-4-one (1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one) alkaloids and limonoids (limonexic acid and limonin). The compounds 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one and limonexic acid were isolated for the first time from the Spiranthera. These furoquinoline and 2-arylquinoli-4-one alkaloids and limonoids showed insecticidal and/or fungicidal activity in the nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Keywords: Spiranthera odoratissima, furoquinoline alkaloids, limonoids, Atta sexdens rubropilosa, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus Introduction Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae), popularly know as Manacá, is a shrub found in the savannah and forest of Central Brazil, and in Bolivia.1 In folk medicine is used in the treatment of rheumatism, gout, kidney infections, urinary retention, abdominal pains, acne and boil.2 According to Matos et al.,3 the ethanolic extract of the S. odoratissima roots contain compounds with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. In previous phytochemical studies of S. odoratissima roots and leaves were reported to contain furoquinoline and b-indoloquinazoline alkaloids, coumarin, terpene, steroid and limonoids.4-5 Leaf-cutting ants (Hymenoptera) are dominant herbivores in the tropics and can be found from the United States Southern to Northern Argentina countries.6 They cultivate a symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, thus they are considering plague.7 Therefore, the biological control of these insects has been the aim of many studies. In this work was determined the toxicity of crude extract and compounds isolated from S. odoratissima branches in nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlations spectra were obtained using Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, with CDCl3 and acetone-d6 using TMS as internal standard. Terezan et al. 883 Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010 For ESIMS analysis, low resolution, was used on triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument. GC/MS (EI) analysis was used a QP5000 Shimadzu, capillary column DB 5MS (30 m, 0.25 mm id, film 0.25 mm). The temperature was programmed initially at 70 °C for 4 min, them increased with a rate of 10 °C min-1 to 280 °C respectively, injection volume was 1 mL in a split mode and temperatures of the detector/ injector were 300 /280 °C. The mass selective detector at 70eV with scans from 50 to 500 u. Plant material Branches of S. odoratissima were collected in Rio Verde-Jataí, GO, Brazil in January/2001 and identified by Dr. José Rubens Pirani. Voucher specimens (4778) were deposited at the Institute of Bioscience herbarium of the University of São Paulo. Compounds extraction and isolation The dried and powdered branches (1.1 kg) were subsequently extracted with n-hexane (1.9 g), CH2Cl2 (7.2 g) and MeOH (16.7 g). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH gradient. The CH2Cl2-EtOAc fraction (4.1 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluting with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient to give 3 fractions A-C. Fraction A (34.4 mg) was fractionated as above, n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient. The fraction A-1 (15.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane- CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding 1 (7.8 mg). Fraction B (689.3 mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient yielding 26 fractions. The fraction B-15 (37.0mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding 2 (8.7 mg). Fraction B-16 (210.1 mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (3.5:6:0.5) and yielded 32 fractions. The fraction B-16.27 (44.5 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (0.5:4:0.5) yielding 3 (7.4 mg). Fraction C (2.1 g) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 70 fractions. The fraction C-34 (397.5mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient and fraction C-34.86 was purified by preparative TLC using CH2Cl2-acetone (4:1) and yielded 4 (18.0 mg). Fraction C-67 (40.4 mg) was fractionated by TLC using CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:3) yielding 5 (5.0 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract was submitted to liquid partition with n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The union of the n-hexane and CH2Cl2 fractions (510.0 mg) was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH, MeOH-CH2Cl2 (4:1, 3:2 and 1:1) to give 38 frations. Fraction 22 (89.0 mg) was submitted to centrifugational chromatography (Cromatroton) using n-hexane-CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 10 fractions. Fraction 22-2 (20.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (1:8:1) and yielded 6 (16.0 mg). Identification of the isolated compounds The isolated compounds were identified using NMR, MS techniques. The furoquinoline alkaloids, dictamine (1), g-fagarine (2) and skimmianine (3) presented spectral data in agreement with the literature.8-9 1-Methyl-2- phenylquinolin-4-one (4)10: Amorphous solid, EIMS m/z (rel. int. %) [M+] 235 (100), 207 (71), 178 (6), 165 (11), 102 (19), 89 (9), 77 (17), 51 (11).

Fungicidal bioassay The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Singer) Möller (syn Rozites gongylophorus) was isolated from an Atta sexdens rubropilosa laboratory nest. The medium for fungus maintenance and methods for the bioassays were previously described.12 Solvent (n-hexane or dichloromethane or methanol) or solution of each extract or solution of compounds (1.0 mL) were added to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose (10.0), sodium chloride (5.0), peptone (5.0), malt extract (10.0) and agar (15.0). Control tubes received 1.0mL of solvent and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes were autoclaved at 121 °C by 15 min and then slanted. The final concentration of n-hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts were 1000 µg mL-1 and of the compounds 1, 2 and 3 were 50 µg mL-1. The fungal suspension was prepared by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1.0gL-1) and gently fragmented. This suspension (1.0 mL) was spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at 25 (±1) °C for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two sets of five tubes each). Fungal growth was estimated macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and density using the modal value. Leaf-cutting ant insecticide biossay The A. sexdens rubropilosa workers used in the assays were randomly removed from laboratory nests. They had Activities of Extracts and Compounds from Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 884 a body mass of 20-25 mg. Before the assays the nests were supplied daily with leaves of Eucalyptus sp., oat seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such as Hibiscussp., Ligustrum sp. or rose petals. Fifty ants were removed from the nests and put into five Petri dishes (ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assay the ants were maintained on an artificial diet prepared with glucose (50.0g L-1), bacto-peptone (10.0 g L-1), yeast extract (1.0gL-1), and agar (15.0 g L-1), in distilled water (100mL).13 The diet (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of compounds (experiment) or without (control) were offered daily in a small plastic cap. The control was prepared with the diet and the solvent. To ensure that undetectable remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants, a comparison made with another set of dishes in which water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not shown). The compounds were poured into the hot diet immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration of the extracts added to the diet were 2000 mg mL-1 and of the compounds 100 mg mL-1 or 500mg mL-1. During the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at a temperature 25(±1)°C and relative humidity ranging between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation was 25 days and number of dead ants was registered daily. The survival median 50% (S50) was calculated and survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted software Graph-Pad™ using the log-rank test. Results and Discussion The compounds isolated from dichloromethane crude extract of the S. odoratissima branches were dictamine8 (1), g-fagarine9 (2), skimmianine8 (3), 1-methyl-2- phenylquinolin-4-one (4), limonexic acid (5) and limonin (6) (Figure 1). The 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4) and limonexic acid (5) were isolated for the first time from the Spiranthera. Compounds 1-3 were identified by comparison of NMR spectral data with those described in the literature,8,9 and the structures of compounds 4, 5 and 6 were confirmed on the basis of 1H NMR, EIMS and ESIMS spectra, and carbon attributions that were made by HSQC and HMBC correlation spectra. The S. odoratissima branches crude extracts showed high inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present insecticidal activity on A. sexdens rubropilosa ants. The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol crude extract (1000 mg mL-1) showed 100% of inhibitory activity on symbiotic fungus (L. gongylophorus). The activities of compounds 1-3 were comparable to those of extracts above. However, 1 and 2 were more fungicide than 3, the two first inhibiting fungus growths at 100% and the later 80%. The compounds 4, 5 and 6, were not tested in this bioassay. These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids are the potentially active compounds in the fungicidal bioassay of dichloromethane crude extract. The fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids skimmianine, kokusaginine, maculine, dictamine, flindersiamine and quinolone obtained from Rutaceae family,10,14 already had been described in literature as powerful inhibitors of symbiotic fungus growth. The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic extracts were tested in ants (A. sexdens rubropilosa) ingestion bioassay (Table 1) and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present insecticidal activity. In contrast with high fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids against the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ants, the ingestion bioassay showed that compounds 1 and 2 showed weak activity in ants ingestion assay, which had S50 ranging from 11.0 and 14.0, respectively, while in the control S50 was 15.0. Only compound 1 presented statistic difference in comparison with control (Table 2), according to the log- rank test (p < 0.05), which considered all tested period. Compound 3 was tested in previous work15 and showed not be toxic to the leaf-cutting ants. Compounds 4-6 isolated from dichloromethane and methanolic extracts showed toxicity against leaf-cutting ants (Table 3). The ants survival median (S50) were in the 7th and 4th day of the experiment, respectively, compared with the control (S50 = 12 days) for Figure 1. Molecular structures of the compounds isolated from S. odoratissima branches extracts: 1: dictamine, 2: g-fagarine, 3:skimmianine, 4: 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one, 5: limonexic acid and 6: limonin. Terezan et al. 885 Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4) and limonin (6) in concentration of 500 mg mL-1. For limonexic acid (5), the most potent compound, at concentration of 500 mg mL-1, the survival median (S50) of the ants were in the 3rd day of the experiment and 98% mortality occurred at the 17th day. This latter result was also observed by Biavatti et al.16 Therefore, these results indicate that the compounds 4-6 are potentially active compounds against A. sexdens rubropilosa. The potential insecticidal and fungicidal activities of the S. odoratissima extracts and of the compounds isolated from the dichloromethane and methanolic extracts suggest the use of this plant in the nest of the leaf-cutting ants control, and the continuation of the investigation of the S.odoratissima bioactive compounds.

The mechanisms involved in the observed cell growth arrest of the four most potent compounds were carried out by studying their effect in cell cycle profile and programmed cell death. The results showed that one triterpene (odoratol) and two limonoids (gedunin and cedrelone) caused cell cycle arrest while only the limonoids gedunin and cedrelone were found to be very potent inducers of apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION Cancer represents one of the most severe health problems worldwide and the development of new anticancer drugs and more effective treatment strategies are fields of utmost importance in drug discovery and clinical therapy. Based on significant advances in cancer biology, much of the research in these areas is currently focused on cancer-specific mechanisms and the corresponding mo- lecular targets [1]. Natural products have been the major sources of chemical di- versity driving pharmaceutical discovery over the past century. Many natural products and synthetically modified natural product derivatives have been successfully developed for clinical use to treat human diseases in almost all therapeutic areas [2]. In fact, plant-derived compounds have played an important role in treat- ment of cancers, and some of the most promising and effective drugs have come up from plant sources like taxol®, camptothecin, combrestatin, vinblastine and vincristine. These drugs have also been the major source of new drug candidates for cancer chemo- therapy [3]. Apart from these, many other plant-derived compounds are now in clinical trials as anticancer agents. One of the most interesting groups of plant natural products is the triterpenoid group. Over the past decade, coming to the fore- ground of interest due to their diverse biological effects are a large group of cyclic triterpenoid-like substances which comprise more than 4000 different identified compounds so far. Triterpenoids are studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, hepatoprotective, anal- gesic, antimicrobial, antimicotic, virostatic, immunomodulatory and tonic effects. They are used in prevention and treatment of hepatitis, parasitic and protozoal infection and above all, for their cytotoxic effects [4]. *Address correspondence to this author at CEQUIMED-UP - Centro de Estudos de Química Medicinal, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Aníbal Cunha 164, 4050-047 Porto, Portugal; Tel: (351) 222078916; Fax: (351) 222003977; E-mail: madalena@ff.up.pt §These authors equally contributed to this work From a biological point of view, most important triterpenoid structures are oleanane, ursane, lupane and dammarane triterpe- noids. However, in what concerns the anticancer effects, not many triterpenoid compounds have been so far studied. Among these, the lupane triterpene betulinic acid and the ursane triterpenes boswellic acid and ursolic acid have been exhaustively studied for their anti- cancer effects. Betulinic acid, which belongs to the lupane group, has been investigated intensively for its anticancer activity. Betulinic acid was found to exhibit the cytotoxic effects against human melanoma cell lines MEL-1, 2 and 4 having the IC50 ranging from 0.5-1.6 g/ml and dose dependent fragmentation of DNA with induction of apoptosis occurred 24 hours after administration [5]. Cytotoxic effects of betulinic acid were also found in other cell lines including ovarian A2780, OVCAR-5, GROV-1, large cell lung cancer NCI- H460, epidermoid carcinoma A431, melanoma Me665/2/21, Me665/ 2/60, small cell lung cancer POGB and POGB/DX (doxorubicin resistant) with the IC50 values ranging from 1.5-4.5 g/ml. How- ever, it showed lower toxicity to non-tumor cell lines such as HDFC (normal dermal fibroblasts, IC50 = 10.2 ± 1.5 g/ml) and PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes, IC50 = 50 g/ml), in compari- son with doxorubicin (HDFC, IC50 = 0.38 g/ml; PBL, IC50 =0.02 g/ml). Interestingly, betulinic acid was markedly more effective than cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and radiation on the primary cancer cells isolated from glioblastoma multiforme [6]. It was demonstrated also that one of the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid and its derivatives was apoptosis induction which was mediated by increasing permeability of the mitochondrial membrane which disturbs the transmembrane potential, causing the release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), with the resulting activation of caspases 3 and 8. Subsequent cleavage of the substrates and nuclear fragmentation thus occurred [7]. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 or BcL-xL proteins suppresses activation of caspases and other markers of apoptosis of neuroectodermal origin [8]. Furthermore, betulinic acid was found to exert its cytotoxic effect against human glioma cell lines 770 Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 Cazal et al. (LN-229, U87, MG, T98G, LN-18 and LN-308) and an increased level of the proapoptotic protein Bax was observed 24 hours after treatment with betulinic acid. The induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for activation of caspase 3, also occurred [9]. On the other hand, clones of these cell lines express- ing high levels of Bcl-2, showed reduced ROS without activation of betulinic acid induced apoptosis. These findings were in accordance with the fact that the antiapoptotic properties of Bcl-2 are connected with antioxidative defence mechanisms. This underlines the importance of producing ROS in the induction of apoptosis by betulinic acid. Betulinic acid is also an inhibitor of the enzyme aminopeptidase N which takes part in the angioproliferative and metastatic activity of tumors. From a clinical perspective, it is interesting to point out that betulinic acid exhibits its greater effect in an environment with a pH lower than 6.8, which is the case for the majority of tumors [10]. Tellingly, in contrast to non- cancer cells, cancer cells subjected to hypothermia showed increased sensitivity to betulinic acid [11]. For the ursane group, boswellic acid and its derivatives were found to be cytotoxic to glioma cell lines [12]. In animal model, depending on dose, they caused an increased passage of cells to apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival after implantation of cell lines of malignant glioma C6 [13]. Deriva- tives of boswellic acid were found to induce differentiation in leu- kemic cell lines in low concentrations and in high concentrations they led to apoptosis [14]. The antiproliferative effects of these derivatives are connected to their ability to inhibit both topoi- somerase I and II, whose activity is critical for the proliferation of cancer cells. Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (AKBA), originally isolated from Boswellia serrata, was found to inhibit constitutive STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription-3) in human multiple myeloma cells [15]. Activation of STAT3 has been linked with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and angiogene- sis of tumor cells, including human multiple myeloma. Thus, agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential as cancer thera- peutics. Lipophilicity of boswellic acid derivatives allows them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and thus renders them the potential for use in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS. Concerning this, they were found to show higher inhibitory effects against glioma cells than those of the clinically used anticancer agents camptothecins [16] and etoposide [12]. Furthermore, derivatives of boswellic acid are shown to be suitable for palliative treatment of progressive or relapsing brain tumors, due to, among other things, their anti-edematous properties [17]. Another interesting member of the ursane group is ursolic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid in higher plants. This compound was found to show inhibitory activity against mammalian DNA polymerases and , and human DNA topoisomerases I and II. It also inhibits bovine DNA polymerase , rat polymerase , HIV reverse transcriptase. It was also found to lower transcription of COX-2 by inhibition of the signal pathways PKC and AP-1. As the expression of PKC and AP-1 is elevated in a number of tumors, thus targeting these molecules is one of the aims of antiproliferative therapy [18]. One of the most important members of the oleanane group is oleanolic acid which is present in high concentration in the ginseng root and it showed a range of antitumour effects. Oleanolic acid was shown to induce differentiation in the teratocarcinoma cell line F9 [19]. Furthermore, it was found to exhibit also antimutagenic and antiangiogenic activities [20, 21]. In addition, it also stimulates the release of NO and TNF-, including induction of iNOS activity and TNF- expression in macrophages. This effect is mediated by its ability to activate DNA binding to the transcription complex NF- B and thereby its activation. Maslinic acid, another oleanane triterpenoid which is present in high concentrations in the protective wax-like coating of olives, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of HT29 colon cancer cells [22]. Treatment with maslinic acid resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death in colon- cancer cells. Mechanism study has revealed that maslinic acid in- hibited considerably the expression of Bcl-2 whilst increasing that of Bax. It also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-c and activated caspases 9 and 3. Finally, for the dammarane group, fomitellic acids A and B, the secondary metabolites of basidiomy- cete Fomitella fraxinea, were shown to inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase and , and human DNA topoisomerase I and II. It exhibited also cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines NUGC-3, and PC-12 where differentiation was observed with subcytotoxic concentrations [23]. In the course of our research program on isolation, synthesis and evaluation of anticancer activity of plant natural products, we have evaluated the capacity of two dammarane type triterpenes (1 and 2), four tirucallane type triterpenes (3-6, Fig. 1) and eight Fig. (1).

Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the four most active compounds was also investigated for their effects on the cell cycle profile and the programmed cell death of the NCI-H460 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, at ambient temperature on a Bruker ARX 400 instrument operating at 400 and 80 MHz, respectively. The Shimadzu LC-6AD model HPLC equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-6AV UV detector (240 and 215 nm) and a Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2Ga column (400 x 25 mm, 5m particle size) was used. For column chromatography, Silica gel 60 (Acros organics) and Sephadex LH 20 (Amersham Pharma- cia Biotech AB) were used. Solvents were from Synt and reagents were from SIGMA, unless otherwise stated. Extraction and Isolation of the Compounds Isolation of Cabraleadiol (1) and Ocotillone (2) Fruits of Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. was collected in Federal University of Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The plant material was identified by T.D. Pennington of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (UK). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of De- partamento de Engenharia Florestral, Dendrologia of the Federal University of Viçosa. After removing seeds, dried fruits (460g) were ground and ex- tracted with ethanol (3 x 500 mL), at room temperature and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 88 g of a concentrated ethanolic extract which was dissolved in 400 ml of a 3:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O. The aqueous methanolic solution was partitioned successively with hexane (2x300 ml), CH2Cl2 (2x300 ml) and EtOAc (2x300 ml) to furnish hexane (47.4 g), dichloro- methane (5.4 g) and ethyl acetate (4.4 g) fractions. The hexane fraction was applied over a silica gel column (250 g) and eluted with hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, eight 700 ml fractions were collected as follows: fr 1 (hexane), fr 2 (hexane- CH2Cl2, 1:1), fr 3 ((hexane-CH2Cl2, 3:7), Fr 4 (hexane), fr 5 (CH2Cl2-EtOAc, 1:1), fr 6 (EtOAc), fr 7 (EtOAc-MeOH, 1:1), fr 8 (MeOH). Fr. 2 (120 mg) was placed on a gel permeation column of Sephadex LH- 20 (50 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of MeOH-CH2Cl2 to afford three 250 ml subfractions. Subfr 2 (88.6 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (15 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of hex- ane-Me2CO to give five 100 ml fractions. Frs 3 and 4, after evapo- ration of the solvent by reduced pressure, afforded, respectively, 24.4 mg of cabraleadiol (1) and 16.3 mg of ocotillone (2) whose structures were established by 1H and 13C NMR as well as compari- son of their spectral and physical data with those reported in the literature [24, 25]. Isolation of 7-Deacetoxy-7-Oxogedunin (7) and 6-Acetoxygedunin (10) Fruits of Carpa guianensis Aubl. were purchased from the city of Belém (Pará State, Brazil). Dried and ground fruit aril (160g) was extracted with MeOH (3 x 500 ml) at room temp. The metha- nolic solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 40 g of the crude methanol extract which was dissolved in 150 ml of a 4:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O and then partitioned with hexane (3x 150 ml) and EtOAc (3x 150 ml) to give, respectively 23 g and 15 g of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. The ethyl acetate extract was Fig. (2). Structure of limonoids (7-14) evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.

Purification of fr 8 by isocratic HPLC, using a mixture of MeOH/ CH2Cl2 (7:3) as solvent and a UV detec- tion at 254 nm, yielded 32.1 mg of 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (7) and 55.8 mg of 6-acetoxygedunin (10) whose structures were estab- lished by comparison of their 1H and 13CNMR data with those re- ported in the literature [26]. Preparation of Acetonide of Odoradol (5) Odoratol (4, 25 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of acetone and one drop of conc.H2SO4 was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, under N2 atmosphere, for 3 h after which the solution was evaporated and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was washed with H2O to remove H2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent gave 15 mg of acetonide of odoratol (5). Isolations of the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3), odoratol (4), 22-hydroxytirucalla-7, 24-diene-2,3-dione (6) and the limon- oids gedunin (8) and 7-deacetoxygedunin (9) from Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona cilata var. australis have been described previ- ously by de Paula et al. [27, 28]. Isolation and characterization of the limonoids 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12), toonacilin (13) from Toona ciliata were described by Neto et al. [29, 30] while isolation of guyanin (14) from Hortia oreadica, was reported by Severino et al. [31]. Biological Activity Reagents RPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, phos- phate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were from Gibco Invitrogen Co. (Scotland, UK). Acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), penicillin, streptomycin, sulforhodamine B (SRB) and trypan blue were from Sigma Chemi- cal Co (Saint Louis, USA). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Tris were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Solutions of Compounds Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and kept at -20 ºC. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were freshly prepared just prior to each assay. Cell Lines Three human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 (breast adenocarci- noma, ECACC), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, a kind gift from NCI, Bethesda, USA) and A375-C5 (melanoma, ECACC) were grown as a monolayer and routinely maintained in RPMI- 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml strepto- mycin), at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Tumour Cell Growth Assay The effect of the compounds on the growth of the described human tumour cell lines was evaluated according to the procedure adopted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) in the “In vitro Anticancer Drug Discovery Screen”, which uses the protein- binding dye SRB to assess cell growth [32, 33]. The plating density of each cell line was 1.5 x 105 cells/ml for MCF-7, and 7.5 x 104 cells/ml for NCI-H460 and A375-C5. Cells were allowed to attach overnight in 96-well plates and were then exposed for 48 h to five serial concentrations of the compounds, starting from a maximum concentration of 150 μM (final concentration). At the end of this incubation period the adherent cells were fixed in situ with 10% TCA (final concentration), washed with distilled water and stained with 0.4% SRB (solubilised in 1% acetic acid). The bound stain was solubilised in 10 mM Tris and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (EAR400 STL-Labinstruments). For each test compound and for each cell line a dose-response curve was made and the value of GI50, corresponding to the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the net cell growth, was calcu- lated as described elsewhere [33]. Doxorubicin, used as a positive control, was tested in the same manner. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile and Levels of Apoptosis in the NCI-H460 Cell Line The compounds with GI50 bellow (or similar to) 10 M were selected for further analysis of their effect on cell cycle profile and apoptosis. These assays were carried out in the NCI-H460 cells, since they were one of the most sensitive cells to these compounds. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7.5104 cells/ml) and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h, in order to adhere. Cells were then incubated for 48 h with complete medium (control), the compounds solvent (DMSO) or with the compounds at their respective GI50 concentra- tions (determined by the SRB assay). Cells were then harvested and further processed for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cellular DNA content (for cell cycle analysis and presence of sub-G1 peak) was then analyzed as previ- ously described [34], using an Epics XL-MCL Coulter flow cy- tometer, plotting at least 20,000 events per sample. Apoptosis was analyzed using the Human Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis Kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Measurement of phosphatidylserine externalization was processed using a flow cytometer plotting at least 20,000 events per sample (as above). Both cell cycle distribution and apoptosis data were analyzed using the FlowJo 7.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). At least three inde- pendent experiments were carried out and results are presented as the average and standard error (SEM) of those experiments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Six triterpenes (Fig. 1) and eight limonoids (Fig. 2) were evalu- ated for their ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of three human tumour cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non- small lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5), using the protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) method and their growth inhibitory effect, expressed as GI50 (M), is shown in Table 1. Following a continuous exposure for 48 h, all six triterpenes (1- 6) and only four limonoids (8, 11, 12, 13) were found to be active against all three tumour cell lines whereas the other four limonoids (7, 9, 10 and 14) were inactive (Table 1). The tirucallane triterpene odoradol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15 - epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) showed strong cell growth inhibitory activity, presenting their GI50 values below 12 M for all three cell lines. Interestingly, the limonoid cedrelone (12) was found to be not only the most active growth inhibitor but also more selective on NCI-H460 (GI50 = 2.77 ± 0.07M) and A375-C5 (GI50 = 2.60 ± 0.21M) cell lines when compared to odoradol (4), gedunin (8) and 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11). While the dammarane cabraleadiol (1) showed moderate activity in all three cell lines (GI50>30 M), the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3) and 22-hydroxytirucalla-7,24-dien-2,3-dione (6) showed moder- ate growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but strong activity against A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, the dammarane triterpene ocotillone (2) showed only weak inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but moderate activity against A375-C5 cells whereas the limonoid toonacillin (13) showed weak inhibitory activity against all three cell lines. Though cabraleadiol (1) and ocotillone (2) are both 20, 24 – epoxydamma- rane, they differ only in the stereochemistry of C-24 and the func- tional group on C-3. With the C-24S configuration and the hydroxyl Evaluation of Triterpenes and Limonoids on Human Tumour Cell Lines Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 773 group on C-3, cabraleadiol (1) exhibited ca. three times higher in growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells than that of ocotillone (2) which has a ketone function on C-3 and the opposite configuration of C-24. However, the growth inhibitory effects on the A375-C5 cells are similar for both compounds. In fact, cabraleadiol (1), isolated from various plant sources, has been previously tested for its cytotoxicity against various tumour cell lines. Phongmaykin et al. [35] reported a weak cytotoxic effect of this compound, isolated from Chisocheton penduliflorus (Meli- aceae), on a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Qiu et al. [24] have found no cytotoxic effect of cabraleadiol (1), isolated from Aglaia lawii, on the LNcaP, Col 2 and KB cancer cell lines. On the other hand, ocotillone (2), isolated from Betula platyphylla var. japonica, was evaluated against a variety of human cancer cell lines, and was found to show no cytotoxicity against the KB (human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx), K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and COLO205 (colon carcinoma) cell lines. Interest- ingly, though ocotillone (2) did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against KB-C2 (cochicine-resistant KB) cells (IC50 values >100 M), it was found to show moderate cytotoxic activity (with IC50 ranging from 20.6 to 64.2 M) in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine. The en- hanced cytotoxicity of ocotillone (2) against KB-C2 cells in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine as compared with that in the absence of colchicine, suggesting that this triterpene might show some MDR-reversing effects [25]. For the tirucallane triterpenes, odoratol (4) was the most active analogue exhibiting GI50 values in the rank of 10 M. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 of odoratol (4) by a ketone group in odoratone (3) caused a two fold decrease of the growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cell lines; however this structural alteration did not affect the growth inhibi- tory activity against the A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, trans- forming the vic diol functionality on the furan ring of odoratol (4) into its acetonide (5) led to a loss of activity. Concerning the limonoids, the most active analogue was cedre- lone (12), exhibiting GI50 values below 5 M in all three cell lines. Although the capacity of cedrelone (12) to inhibit the in vitro growth of human tumour cells have not been previously reported, this compound is known to demonstrate several other activities including insecticide [36], antifeedant [37] and antifungal activity [38]. Although its growth inhibitory effect was ca. two folds less than that of cedrelone, the structurally related limonoid 6-acetoxy- 14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) also exhibited strong growth inhibi- tory activity against all three cancer cell lines. Interestingly, Maneerat et al. [39] have found that 6-acetoxyepoxyazadione, isolated from Chisocheton siamensis and which differs from 11 only in the presence of the carbonyl group on C-16 of the former, was inactive against oral human epidermal carcinoma (KB), small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Among the limonoids whose structure possessing the lactone moiety on the ring D, gedunin (8) was the only member which exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three human tumour cell lines (GI50 10 M); however 7-deacetylgedunin (9) was inactive. Inter- estingly, Brandt et al. [40] have evaluated, among several ana- logues, gedunin (8) and 7-deacetylgedunin (9), obtained from neem oils, for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cell lines. While gedunin (8) was found to exhibit strong antiproliferative activity against both cell lines (IC50 = 8.84±0.03 for MCF-7 and 3.22± 0.6 for SKBr3), 7-deacetylgedunin (9) showed only moderate activity (IC50 = 28.96±4.48 for MCF-7 and 21.09± 5.95 for SKBr3). Gedunin (8) was also shown to mani- fest anticancer activity via inhibition of the 90 kDa heat shock pro- tein (Hsp90) folding machinery [41] and to induce the degradation of Hsp90-dependent client proteins similar to other Hsp90 inhibi- tors [42]. In order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the most active compounds, they were assayed for their effect on the cell cycle profile of the NCI-H460 cells. Thus, NCI-H460 cells were treated with odoratol (4), gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) at their respective GI50 concentrations (values of GI50 for NCI-H460 from Table 1) for 48 h and processed for cell cycle analysis. Results (Fig. 3) show that the majority of the compounds tested (with the exception of 11) affected the normal cell cycle distribution of the NCI-H460 cells. Odoratol (4) was found to induce a cell cycle ar- Table 1.

Doxorubicin was used as positive control of the assay and the following GI50 values were obtained: MCF-7 = 42.8 ± 8.2 nM; NCI-H460 = 94.0 ± 8.7 nM; A375-C5 = 79.5 ± 8.4 nM. 774 Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10 Cazal et al. rest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% cells in this phase upon DMSO treatment to 70% of cells following treatment with this compound), causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 13%) and G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 11%) phases of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with gedunin (8), the cell cycle progression was blocked (arrested) in the S phase (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 60%), leading to a de- crease in the % of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). Incubation with cedrelone (12) caused an accumulation of cells (arrest) in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 40%) and the G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 43%) phases of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the % of cells in G1 (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). In addition, there were indications that odoratol (4), gedunin (8) and cedrelone (12) induced apoptosis because of the increase in the sub-G1 popu- lation of cells when compared to control. Therefore, a specific apoptosis assay was carried out. Indeed, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was performed to deter- mine the % of cells in early and late apoptosis (and necrosis) by flow cytometry, following treatment of NCI-H460 cells with the selected compounds. Results showed that for all tested compounds, but very modestly for odoratol (4) and 6-acetoxy-14,15- epoxyazadirone (11), the % of cells in early (annexin V positive, PI negative) or late apoptosis (annexin V-positive, PI positive) were increased upon treatment of cells with the GI50 concentration of the compounds (Table 2). Gedunin (8) caused an increase in cell death from approximately 12.6% in controls (or 11.2% in DMSO control) to 47.2% in cells treated for 48 h with the GI50 concentration of this compound. Indeed, cedrelone (12) was particularly effective in inducing programmed cell death, causing 80.3% of cell death upon 48 h treatment of the cells with its GI50 concentration. It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the observed apoptotic inducing effects, particularly the effects on caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be investigated, by analyzing the levels of Bax and other apoptosis related proteins, such as Bcl-2 or BcL-xL. This would be possible by analyzing ex- tracts of cells treated with the compounds (with or without caspase inhibitors) for the levels of apoptosis associated proteins, by West- ern Blot with appropriate antibodies, as has been carried out by others for example in order to study the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by lupeol [43]. CONCLUSION Six triterpenes (two dammaranes and four tirucallanes) and eight limonoids, isolated from the members of the families Meli- aceae and Rutaceae, were evaluated by the SRB method for their cytotoxic effect against three human tumour cell lines. The tirucal- lane triterpene odoratol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12) were the most active inhibitors of cell growth (GI50 less than 12 μM). Of these, cedrelone (12) has shown to be the most active growth in- hibitor, presenting GI50 values below 4.20 μM in all three tested cell lines. From the analysis of the cell cycle profile in NCI-H460 cells, it was possible to conclude that odoratol (4) arrests cell cycle at the G1 phase, gedunin (8) causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase and cedrelone (12) at the S and G2M phases while 6-acetoxy-14,15- epoxyazadirone (11) did not affect the cell cycle profile of these cells. In addition, analysis of programmed cell death indicates that odoratol (4) and 6-acetoxy-14,15-epoxyazadirone (11) cause a very small increase in cell death but gedunin (8) and particularly cedrelone (12), are very potent inducers of programmed cell death. In conclusion, cedrelone (12) is very potent by causing cell cycle Fig. (3).

It is evident from the number of recent studies that triterpenoid compounds represent a promising and expanding platform for natu- ral anticancer agents whose potential is currently still not fully ex- ploited by pharmaceutical industry. As a number of recently studied triterpenoids compare very favourably with drugs in current use [44], it is foreseeable that attention of many research institutions and pharmaceutical companies will be drawn to this class of com- pounds.

Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of H. oreadica, H. brasiliana and H. superba searching for other secondary metabolites present in substantial amounts for taxonomic analysis. In a continuation of the investigation of the H. oreadica, three new limonoids have now been isolated 9α-hydroxyhortiolide A, 11β-hydroxyhortiolide C and 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7- deoxoinchangin. All the isolated compounds from the Hortia species reinforce its position in the Rutaceae. With regard to limonoids the genus produces highly specialized compounds, whose structural variations do not occur in any other member of the Rutaceae, thus, it is evident from limonoid data that Hortia takes an isolated position within the family. In addition, H. superba afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen, which may not be a genuine natural product. Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle- spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, X-Ray fluorescence and Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy experiments show that the Sephadex LH-20 was modified after treatment with NaOCl, suggesting that when xanthotoxin (8-methoxy-psoralen) was extracted from cleaning of the gel column, chlorination of the aromatic system occurred.

Introduction Previous investigations of H. oreadica reported the presence of a wide spectrum of complex limonoids and dihydrocinnamic acids [1–3]. Our interest in the Rutaceae motivated a reinvestigation of H. oreadica, H. brasiliana and H. superba. Three new limonoids have now been isolated (1–3), 1 and 3 from taproots and 2 from stem of H. oreadica. In addition, H. superba afforded the unexpected coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (4) from branches (Figure 1). Figure 1.

Hypohalite (HOX) is the halogenating species produced by haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. This may be considered as a source of electron-deficient halogen (X+) that can react with an electron-rich centre in the substrate, as the coumarins. In contrast, the most common types of halogenated coumarins are those with a prenyl epoxide ring, which was cleaved under acid conditions (H+/Cl−). There is some suspicion that these compounds are artefacts of the isolation procedures. These compounds are a comparatively rare group isolated from Rutaceae plants such as in Toddalia asiatica [5,7-dimethoxy-6- (3-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)coumarin], Murraya paniculata [7-methoxy-8-(1-hydroxy-2-chloro- 3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin, 7-methoxy-8-(1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl)coumarin], and in Triphasia trifolia [7-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)-8-(3-methyl-2-oxobutyl)coumarin, 5-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-3-chloro-2-hydroxybutoxyl)psoralen] [4–6]. Aromatic systems react with chlorine in an electrophilic substitution reaction, in which chlorine acts as the electrophile (Cl+), whose presence is rare in the isolation procedures. 3-Chloro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-chromen-2-one appears to be unique as natural metabolite in the coumarin class, which was isolated from leaves of Ficus krishnae, Moraceae [7]. Most of the phytochemical studies on Rutaceae genera have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed coumarin containing chlorine in the 1-benzopyran-2-one skeleton if they had been present. In developing countries, as in Brazil, where universities and research funding agencies cannot afford Sephadex (LH-20) in sufficient quantities for scientific studies, using cleaning gel with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a common practice. However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of Sephadex LH-20 and hypochlorite in the formation of compound 4, until the cleaning gel is analyzed by solid NMR, X-Ray fluorescence (XRF), Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), Infrared (IR), and Fourier transform Raman (FTR) to confirm whether this can serve as an efficient chloroniun ion supplier. Molecules 2014, 19 12033 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structure Elucidation of New Compounds The spectra of compounds 1–4 can be seen in Figures S1–S30 in the online Supplementary. Compound 1 showed spectral characteristics close to those of hortiolide A (5) (C27H32O7; Figure 1), which has previously been isolated from H. colombiana (H. colombiana = H. brasiliana) [8]. HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H32O8 for compound 1, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with 5. The main change observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 1 was the presence of a signal of a hydrogen of a hydroxyl group at δ 2.94 (s). This hydrogen at δ 2.94 showed HMBC correlation with the 13C-NMR signals of C-8 (δ 90.2). The methyl proton signal at δ 1.52, assigned to Me-19, showed cross peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-1 (δ 178.8), C-5 (δ 42.3), C-10 (δ 50.6), and at δ 80.5 (quaternary), allowing the assignment of the last signal to C-9, since it was the only carbon left in the skeleton for a 3J. These correlations indicated the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-9. The relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was determined from gNOESY experiments. The nOes of the H3-19 (δ 1.52), H3-18 (δ 1.21) and H3-30 (δ 1.71), coming from 9-OH (δ 2.94), required the 9-OH to be syn (α) to Me-18, Me-19 and Me-30. The structure of the new natural product 1 was thus established as 9α-hydroxyhortiolide A. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of hortiolide A (5) [9]. Table 1. 1H-NMR spectroscopic data for 1–4.

Compound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) to hortiolide C (6) isolated previously from dichloromethane extract of taproots of H. oreadica [2]. In HMBC experiments the unsubstituted Molecules 2014, 19 12035 C-12 emerged from the correlation between the H3-18 signal at δ 1.15 and the 13C signal at δ 42.7, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 1.68 (m), ascribed to H2-12. The signal for H-12 was coupled to the 1H signal at δ 4.43 (d, J = 4.8 Hz) assigned to H-11, indicating a hydroxyl group at C-11. HREIMS showed the molecular formula C27H32O9 and confirmed the structure 2 for this compound. In the g-NOESY experiments, the nOes of the H3-19 (δ 1.54) and H3-30 (δ 1.80), coming from H-11 (δ 4.43), required the 11-OH to be anti (β) to Me-18 and Me-30. Thus, the structure of compound 2 was proposed as 11β-hydroxyhortiolide C. The NMR spectra and extensive analysis of 2D-NMR spectra (Table 2) suggested the ichangin-type (7) [12] framework for compound 3. Some of the changes observed in the NMR spectra were signals for the presence of a secondary acetoxyl group (13C signals δ 169.6, 21.4, 1H signal -OCOMe δ 2.15). A significant downfield shift for C-1 (δ 80.0), when compared with ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7), determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. The 13C signal at δ 80.0 showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 4.04 (brd, J = 4.2 Hz), which showed cross-peaks with the 13C-NMR signals for C-3 (δ 169.4), C-19 (δ 65.6), and C-9 (δ 43.3). The 1H signal at δ 4.04 and a methyl signal at δ 2.15 showed long-range correlation with the 13C-NMR signals at δ 169.6, confirming an acetoxyl group at C-1. A second change observed in the 13C-NMR spectra was the replacement of the resonance for a carbonyl by signal for an oxymethine carbon at δ 73.2, which showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at δ 4.56 (t, J = 2.6 Hz). A hydroxyl group must thus be connected to C-7 due to the observed correlations of the 1H signal at δ 4.56 with the 13C-NMR for C-5 at δ 53.6, C-8 at δ 43.0 and C-30 at δ 18.4. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7). The NOE of the H-1 (δ 4.04) coming from H-5 (δ 2.25) and H-9 (δ 2.72) were weak but definite, suggesting a spatial proximity of H-1α to H-5α and H-9α, and confirming the acetoxyl group in the β-configuration as in ichangin (Figure 1, structure 7, S* configuration at C-1) [12]. In addition, the NOE of the H-7 (δ 4.56) coming from H3-30 (δ 0.95) required the hydroxyl group at C-7 to be anti (α) to H3-30 (β). The structure of the new natural product 3 was thus established as 1(S*)-acetoxy-7(R*)-hydroxy-7-deoxoinchangin. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C-NMR spectrum (Table 2) with those of ichangin (7) [12]. The coumarin 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen (4) was not separated from xanthotoxin (8) and isopimpinellin (9). The 1H-NMR in addition to signals described in the literature for 8 and 9, revealed signals nearly the same as that of 9 (Table 1). In addition four methoxyl group signals were observed at δ 4.27, 4.16 (6H), and 4.29, which were placed at C-8 in 8, C-5 and C-8 in 9 and at C-8 in 4, respectively, by NOE experiments. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of coumarins if C-5 is unsubstituted the doublets arising from H-3 and H-4 are found at ca δ 6.2 and 7.6, respectively. The downfield shift of the H-4 to about δ 8.0 occurs in C-5 alkoxyl-substituted coumarins, as in 9 in comparison with 8 [13]. Hence, the doublets at δ 7.76, 8.11 and 8.15 were assigned to H-4 for 8, 9, and 4, respectively, and indicating that C-5 was substituted in 4. This mixture was analyzed by GC-MS (Figures S26–S29 in supplementary), which established that the coumarins were xanthotoxin (8), isopimpinellin (9), and indicated the compound 4 to contain chlorine, determining the position of this halogen at C-5, whose spectroscopic properties accord with the above data. This mixture was also analyzed by ESI-MS (Figure 30 in supplementary), which showed protonated molecule ([M + H+]) at m/z 251.5 and ([M+2 + H+]) 253.5 for compound 4. Simulation of isotope ratio mass spectrum for C12H7O4Cl provided the differences in Molecules 2014, 19 12036 naturally-occurring isotopic abundances, which showed peaks similar to those found for compound 4, the [M+2 + H+] (m/z 253) peak about one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak ([M + H+] m/z 251), confirming the presence of chlorine. Although, the structure of 4 has been described as being a synthetic product and the 1H-NMR data for both are in close agreement with the structure proposed 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen [10]. 2.2. Sephadex LH-20 Analysis The mixture of coumarins 4, 8 and 9 was purified by gel permeation column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20, which was repacked with cleaning gel with sodium hypochlorite (0.8% watery solution). Sephadex LH-20 is cross-linked dextran which has been hydroxypropylated to yield a chromatographic media with both hydrophilic and lipophilic character [14,15]. Solid-state cross-polarization/magic-angle-spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS 13C-NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural product formed by the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite. Pure Sephadex LH-20 and the gel, which was washed only with sterile distilled water and allowed to swell overnight, were used as control. The HETCOR experiment (Figure 2) permitted the assignments of the protonated carbons signals at δ 97–94, 72–70, 68–63, and 15–20 to all C-1, C-2-4, C-5-6 and the methyl of propyl group, respectively, comparable with those reported for dextran samples [16,17]. It is clear that water induces no change in chemical shifts as shown in Figure 3. However, it is noted that the treatment with water leads to the increase of the linewidth. Another important observation which should be noted regards the intensity of the signals related to the carbons from glycoside units. For non-treated Sephadex, the hydroxyl groups from glycoside units in different polymeric chains interact through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the structure becomes very rigid, favoring the dipolar coupling. In this case the cross polarization is more efficient and the signals become more intense, even when compared to side aliphatic branches [18]. The 13C-NMR spectrum for cleaning gel (Figure 3) showed that the signals for all C-1 (δ 97–94) were of markedly different intensity (lowest intensity), suggesting the oxidation of α-D-glucopyranoses by hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which would result in depolymerisation [19]. In Sephadex LH-20 C-2-4 are hydroxypropylated, thus δ-aldonolactone could have glycosidic linkages by hydroxypropyl groups. This spectrum also showed that sodium hypochlorite affected the shape of the 13C-NMR signals for all C-2-4 (δ 81-70), suggesting that the oxidation reaction of free -OH at carbons C-2 and C-3 may have occurred. The C-5, C-6 and methyl signals of control and cleaning gel appeared at similar chemical shifts. The CP/MAS 13C-NMR experiments showed that the course of the reaction with hypochlorite is somewhat more complex than the oxidation indicated for C-1, C-2 and C-3. Hypochlorite specifically oxidizes the α anomer, and the initial product formed is a δ-aldonolactone (Scheme 1). Although, the free -OH in the glycoside units and in the hydroxypropyl groups must have been involved in the reaction with hypochlorous acid formed in the equilibrium of sodium hypochlorite and H2O, resulting in dextran ether hypochlorite (Scheme 1), which can serve as an efficient chloronium ion supplier [20,21].

For pure Sephadex this ratio is 4.0, for Sephadex-H2O it is approximately 3.3 and for Sephadex-H2O-NaOCl it is 2.0. This variation seems to be quite intriguing, but it is possible that this is related to the exchange of hydrogen by chlorine atoms, which occurred in the polar hydroxyl groups from the glycoside units. Furthermore, the presence of chlorine atoms and water molecules induce the increasing distance between chains. Once these events takes place the cross-polarization 1H→13C becomes less efficient, and the signal becomes less intense as mentioned earlier [18]. In order to observe the possible formation of dextran ether hypochlorite in the structure of Sephadex, 35Cl solid state NMR experiments were run, however no signal was observed (as can be seen in Figure 31 in supplementary). There are few papers in the literature that investigate 35Cl-NMR in organic compounds, and they always involve small molecules [22–24]. Field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy analyses of pure Sephadex LH-20, gel washed with water, and gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite showed homogeneous beads in the first two (Figures 4 and S32–S34 in supplementary). In contrast, beads originating from gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite were not homogeneous and some strange material aggregates were observed between and on the polymer beads (Figure 4). These differences suggest modification in the structure of the polymer, or the presence of reaction products with hypochlorite or of salt sodium hypochlorite and HOCl. Comparing the standard gel with those treated with NaOCl shows that there is a decrease in the diameter of some particles, suggesting a dilution or formation of other products (Figure 4D,E). X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry was used and the results showed the presence of chlorine in pure Sephadex LH-20, in gel washed with sterile distilled water and cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (Figure 5). The chlorine content was 1.8 fold greater in the gel cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (0.159%) than that in pure Sephadex LH-20 (0.089%), and 2.9 than that in gel washed with water (0.055%).

These data suggest that if there were oxidation reactions and the formation of hypochlorite, their yields were low. In their FTR spectra there is a band at 847 cm−1 corresponding to the vibration of the α-anomer, characteristic of Sephadex [25]. Given that the yield of the reaction with hypochlorite was low, a second hypothesis is that the hypochlorite salt and HOCl retained on Sephadex beads react directly with the active aromatic system for aromatic substitution reactions with HOCl. Concluding two synthetic pathways to chlorination is possible, in the presence of dextran ether hypochlorite or HOCl retained on Sephadex beads, and when the mixture of xanthotoxin (8) and isopimpinellin (9) were extracted from cleaning Sephadex LH-20 column, the chlorination of aromatic system occurred in 8 giving 5-chloro-8-methoxy-psoralen. These results showed that the use of cleaning Sephadex LH-20, deserves more attention than it has received so far. 2.3. Identification of Known Compounds The major types of rutaceous secondary metabolites were also isolated and they show that H. oreadica, H.brasiliana and H. superba are related to other species of Hortia. However, the alkaloids N-methylatanine, robustine [26,27], 7,8-dehydrorutaecarpine [28], edulitine [29], integriquinolone [30], the coumarins psoralen, bergapten, xanthotoxin, 5-methoxyseselin, braylin, isopimpinellin, prangol, heraclenol, seselin, 5-methoxyseselin [31], the flavonoids isosakuranetin [32], acacetin [29], neoponcirin [33], and the limonoid limonin [34] are reported for the first time from the Hortia. Groppo and collaborators [35,36] studying plants of the genus Hortia showed that H. brasiliana, H. arborea, H. colombiana and H. chocoensis represent the same arborescent species, and that H. brasiliana V. and ex. DC. H. badinii M.A. Lisboa was used to designate individuals of Hortia, but this error was corrected by Groppo and collaborators [35], who recognized it as H. brasiliana. The name H. brasiliana was wrongly applied to a shrubby species of central Brazil by Saint-Hilaire, today recognized as H. oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani [35]. H. superba Ducke, H. regia Sandwith and H. longifolia Spruce (ex. Engl) are accepted species in the genus Hortia according to Groppo and Pirani [36]. The known compounds isolated in this work and occurrences in other Hotia species can be seen in supplementary Table S1. 3. Experimental Section 3.1. Instrumentation Optical rotations were measured by using a Perkin Elmer 241 spectropolarimeter, or DIP 370 Jasco.

IR: Bomen-Ft/IR. FEG-SEM Molecules 2014, 19 12041 micrographs: Supra 35-VP, Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany. NMR: Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard. All the solid state NMR experiments were performed in a Bruker Avance III 400 machine, operating at a 9.4 T magnetic field, which corresponds to 399.94 MHz for 1H, 100.57 MHz for 13C and 39.206 MHz for 35Cl resonance frequencies. This machine is equipped with a MAS 4mm broadband solid state probehead. The sample (powdered) was packed in a 4mm zirconia rotor, and a KEL-F cap. The carbon-13 1D spectra were obtained by using a ramped cross polarization under magic angle spinning with total side band suppression (pulse sequence named CPTOSS). These experiments were conducted at 298 K and using a spinning speed of 5000 Hz. The CPTOSS parameters were: contact time of 2 ms, recycle delay of 5 s, acquisition time of 34 ms, spectral width of 295 ppm and 512 scans were averaged. High power decoupling was done by using a TPPM15 decoupler program under a 1H field of 70 KHz. 2D 1H-13C FSLG-HETCOR experiment were run at 10,000 Hz of spinning speed. The pulse sequence parameters were: recycle delay of 2 s, contact time of 200 μs for observing spin diffusion signals, number of scans of 32, LG field of 80 Khz, acquisition time of 16 ms and SPINAL64 for decoupler program at 70KHz of 1H irradiation, and 256 transients were obtained in F1. FSLG-HETCOR was performed at only 298 K, in a total time of 4.5 h. The pulse sequence used for acquiring 35Cl solid state NMR was one pulse with acquisition time of 44 ms, a spectral window of 1200 ppm and the spinning speed was 10,000 Hz. For all the experiments the sample was spun by using gaseous nitrogen. FT Raman: I-Raman 485-H, Laser 785 nm BWTEK (USA). XRF: MiniPal 4, PW 4024, P Analytical B.V. (Almelo, The Netherlands). 3.2. Cleaning Sephadex LH-20 and Repacked Column When a column has been in use for some time, it may be necessary to remove contaminants. Thus the gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed with 0.8% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by gentle agitation and was allowed to react overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was washed three times with sterile distilled water to remove residual NaOCl. After cleaning, the column was carefully re-equilibrated with 2–3 column volumes of methanol before it is used again. Part of cleaning Sephadex was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis. The control gel was transferred into a large beaker and it was washed only with sterile distilled water by gentle agitation and was allowed to swell overnight. The supernatant was transferred into the other beaker, and the precipitate was dried in an air circulation chamber for solid 13C-NMR analysis. 3.3. Plant Material Hortia brasiliana V. and Ex. D.C. was collected (May 2000) in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. H. oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani was collected (September 2005) in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. H. superba Ducke was collected (December 2001) in road from Manaus to Itacoatiara km 31, Amazonas state, Brazil. All the plants were identified by José Rubens Pirani of the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo, and vouchers are deposited in the herbarium of the same department (Pirani 4672 and Groppo Jr. 458, Groppo Jr. 950, respectively). Molecules 2014, 19 12042 3.4. Extraction and Isolation Ground taproots (3.3 kg), stems (2.4 kg) and leaves (3.2 kg) of Hortia oreadica, stem (938 g), stem bark (270 g) and leaves (655 g) of H. brasiliana, stem (938 g), and stem bark (270 g) of H. superba were successively extracted using hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH, at room temperature. Small branches of H. superba were also analyzed, and ground branches (483 g) were extracted 3 times at room temperature using ethanol. All extracts were monitored by 1H-NMR (200 MHz) and ESI-MS/MS. Only those displaying features of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives and limonoids absent in the previous investigations were examined. These extracts were repeatedly purified by silica gel column chromatography (CC, 230–400 mesh), gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH-20), preparative TLC, by the centrifugal preparative TLC performed on a chromatotron of Harrison research 50B, Spectra/Chrom CF1-fraction collector, silica gel 375 mesh, diameter 26 cm, and then by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification (polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G).

Conclusions This study shows that H. oreadica taproots appear to be a rich source of complex limonoids. By contrast, other organs of Hortia species have long been the subject of chemical investigation, which have found many typically rutaceous compounds but the limonoids are simple and less abundant than in the H. oreadica taproots. Therefore, all Hortia roots or taproots should be re-examined for limonoids. Clearly further chemical investigations on the interaction of Sephadex LH-20 and sodium hypochlorite will be essential to better understand the structures of the products formed. Additional experiments by enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain the main oxidized components soluble for NMR and MS analysis are in progress. However, information on the risks to recover Sephadex LH-20 with NaOCl must be clarified immediately, to avoid publication of possible chlorinated compounds as a natural occurrence.

(Received: July 22, 2008 - Accepted: May 13, 2009) ABSTRACT As part of our ongoing bioprospecting studies on secondary metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of São Paulo State (Brazil), we describe the identification of triterpenes and sterols present in the hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax of Pterogyne nitens Tulasne (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) using high resolution gas chromatography. Compounds detected in these extracts include β-amyrin (1), taraxerol acetate (2), lupenone (3), β-amyrenone (4), germanicone (5), campesterol (6), stigmasterol (7), and β-sitosterol (8). The method reported herein is shown to be a rapid, sensitive and reproducible tool for describing triterpenes and sterols present in non-polar extracts. Keywords: Pterogyne nitens; Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae; sterols; triterpenes; gas chromatography. INTRODUCTION Nature is an extremely rich source of highly diverse and innovative chemical structures, which have played a significant role in the process of drug discovery and design.1,2 In this context, there has been renewed alert in the rapid rate of plant species extinction3, which reduces the time left to explore the remaining resources of natural compounds. Urgent efforts are thus mandatory to speed up collection and selection of plants for chemical-biological investigation and possible conservation for future beneficial use of humankind.4 Among legumes of the Caesalpinioideae subfamily, Pterogyne nitens Tul. popularly named “bálsamo”, “cocal”, “amendoim-bravo”, “yvi-raró” is the sole member of the genus, and has been submitted to a strong anthropogenic impact, which has led to its numerical population retraction, and classification into the category of species in critical risk. It is found only in small non-protected areas in South America, and is therefore, subjected to the prompt possibility of extinction5-7. Regarding ethnopharmacological information, this legume is used for treatment of parasitic infestations, mainly Ascaris lumbricoides.8 In previous chemical reports, the chromatographic fractionation of the extract from the leaves furnished cytotoxic guanidine alkaloids.9,10 Recent works on the leaves and fruits led to a series of flavonols and flavones which exhibited myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging properties.11-14 In this work, we have employed high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) to investigate the sterols and triterpenes from P. nitens, as a promising tool to our bioprospecting activities within program BIOTA-FAPESP (The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program), which aims to inventory and characterize the biodiversity of São Paulo State, and explore mechanisms for its conservation and sustainable use. EXPERIMENTAL Plant material The leaves, stems, fruits and flowers of Pterogyne nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003 and identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Preparation of the hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax Each plant material (50.0 g) was dried at 40 oC, powdered and extracted exhaustively at room temperature with hexane (200 mL, 5 days x 3). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure in a rotatory evaporator (< 40 oC) to yield dried hexane extracts from leaves (3.1 g), stems (1.8 g), fruits (2.5 g) and flowers (1.7 g). Fresh leaves (100.0 g) were individually dipped for ca. 5 s into 50 mL dichloromethane. After filtration to remove plant debris, the solvent was evaporated using a stream of gaseous nitrogen affording a foliar epicuticular wax (87.0 mg) which was immediately analyzed by HRGC. Samples clean-up Samples of each crude extract (10 mg) were dissolved in chloroform (3.0 mL) and percolated through chromatographic column over celite:norit (1:1, 100.0 mg) + silica gel (200.0 mg) eluted with chloroform (10.0 mL). After evaporation to dryness at room temperature, the eluate was dissolved in hexane: ethyl acetate (7:3) and analyzed by HRGC in three replicates. Gas chromatographic conditions All the extracts were analyzed by HRGC on a Varian model CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with split injector [initial splitless; 0.75 min (1:50); 2.00 min (1:20)] at 260 ºC, and flame ionization detector at 310 ºC for SPB- 5 column and 290 ºC for SPB-50 column. The injected volume was 2.0 µL. SPB-50 (cross-linked 50% phenyl-methyl-siloxane, 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm) and SPB-5 (cross-linked 5% phenyl-methyl-siloxane, 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm) capillary columns were employed. In the case of SPB-50, the column temperature was 280 ºC (isotherm), whereas for SPB-5, a column temperature program was employed in which the initial temperature was 250 ºC, held for 12 min, followed by a temperature increase of 6 ºC min-1 to 280 ºC, then held for additional 30 min. Nitrogen was employed as carrier gas at an average linear velocity of 1 mL/min. Triterpenes and sterols were identified by comparison of the relative retention (RR) of the samples with the RR of the standard sterols and triterpenes. Cholesterol was used as internal standard. Authentic standard sterols and triterpenes Triterpenes and steroids used as standards were previously isolated from Lauraceae and Rubiaceae species, including Alibertia macrophylla, A. sessilis, Licaria rodriguesii, L. subbulata, and Aniba parviflora. Their molecular structures were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS techniques.15-17 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Hexane extracts from leaves, fruits, flowers and stems of P. nitens, in addition to the foliar epicuticular wax were analyzed by HRGC using a method which does not require pre-derivatizations. The GC-FID method used in this study employed two different columns: SPB-5 and SPB-50, which were used due to their low polarity, inertness towards organic compounds and high temperature limit. Such features make them ideal for the analysis of underivatized semi-volatile plant extracts. The chromatogram obtained in SPB-50 column for the hexane extract from P. nitens stems evidences good resolution of peaks and thus proper identification of major components by comparison of RR (relative retention) values with those of authentic samples (Figure 1A). The presence of each triterpene or sterol was additionally confirmed by co-injection with authentic standards to avoid misclassifications due to overlapping of retention zones. e-mail: dhsilva@iq.unesp.br J.

(+) presence of the compound; (-) absence of the compound. Our results indicate that β-sitosterol (8) is present in all the analyzed extracts. Additional widely occurring sterols: campesterol (6) and stigmasterol (7), were also characterized in all analyzed hexane extracts, except from the leaves. The pentacyclic triterpenes β-amyrin (1) and lupenone (3) were detected in the stems and flowers, whereas germanicone (5) was identified in the leaves and stems; and β-amyrenone (4) was detected in the flowers extract. Further GC-FID analyses of foliar epicuticular wax showed the presence of 1, 5 and, taraxerol acetate (2). These results clearly demonstrate that the hexane extracts from stems and flowers present higher chemodiversity than the others. On the other hand their chemical profile indicated common major constituents concerning sterols and triterpenes in the analyzed samples evidencing great similarity among the studied plant part extracts. Altogether, these results corroborate differences in the secondary metabolites production by different plant tissues, which can be relevant from the point of view of the chemical interface between plants and the surrounding environment.18 In this context, several studies indicated variable production of secondary metabolites by medicinal plants.19 Zangerl and Bazzaz reported different levels of furanocoumarins from Pastinaca sativa (Apiaceae) leaves and roots.20 Likewise, Rees described flowers of Hypericum hirsutum (Clusiaceae) contain five to ten times more hypericin that the leaves.21 Considering that young leaves and other growing plant parts are generally better protected by secondary compounds than mature tissues, young leaves of rosette plants of Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae) were found to contain up to 53 times higher levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids than older leaves.22 In the case of non-polar extracts, bioactivity has been often associated with complex mixtures of triterpenoid and/or steroid compounds23-26. However, no further analysis/identification of the mixture components is subsequently performed in most cases due to two reasons: Firstly, traditional phytochemical procedures, which include isolation of the components from isomeric mixtures, may be tedious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. Secondly, due to their structural complexity the analysis of triterpenes and sterols by spectroscopic techniques has been shown to be difficult in many cases. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has emerged as the best technique for characterization of low-polarity compounds, including triterpenes, sterols, glycerols, waxes, and derivatized fatty acids. However, this hyphenated analytical technique is still inaccessible to many research groups around the world. On the other hand, GC is more readily available and might also be employed as a preliminary procedure for rapid, simple, and relatively cheap characterization of non-polar compounds from plant extracts, including epicuticular waxes. The present phytochemical screening using HRGC showed to be reliable and useful for the identification of triterpenes and sterols in complex matrices such as hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax from P. nitens (Figure 2). Other interesting applications of this technique include the selection of plant extracts containing bioactive non-polar compounds for further phytochemical and pharmacological investigations, which may represent a crucial step in bioprospecting studies and corroborates its importance as a tool for conducting phytochemical studies.
