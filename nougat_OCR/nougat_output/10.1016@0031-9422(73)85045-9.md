C6H6-CHCl3 (1:1) with the aid of a few ml of EtOH. Addition of 100 g of silica gel followed by evaporation of solvent gave a free-flowing powder which was placed on a column of 500 g of siliciic acid and rechromatographed in the usual manner, 1 l. fractions being collected. The only solid material was found in fractions 91-93 (CHCl3-MeOH 99:1). Recrystallization afforded 0:25 g of 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone, m.p. 246-248deg (lit 253-254deg,3 246-247deg 4), NMR signals (DMSO-_d_6) at 7:91 \(d\) and 6:90 \(d\) (_J_9, \(A\)2_B_2 system of H-2', H-3', H-5' and H-6'), 6:62 \(d\) and 6:27 \(d\) (_J_2, _AB_ system of H-6 and H-8), 3:82 and 3:78 (two methoxyls), UV _l_max 352:5 and 267 nm, with added NaOAc 355 and 268 nm, with added AlCl3 352:5, 305 and 277 nm, with added NaOAc 395 and 270 nm, with added NaOAc-H3BO3 350 and 267 nm. Direct comparison with an authentic sample of 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone supplied by Prof. P. R. Jefferies established identity. Extraction of Barr No. 65-191 gave similar results.

The present report corroborates the findings of Higo _et al._1 that _A. eriocentra_ yields no easily crystallizable homogeneous sesquiterpene lactone components. 5,4'-Dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone has previously been isolated from an unnamed new _Beyeria_ species,3 from _Alpinia Kumatake_,4_A. japonica_,5_Eucryphia lucida_,6_Cistus ladanifera_,7_Cheilanthes farinosa8 and _Larrea cuneifolia_,9 but not, to the best of our knowledge, from a Composite.

tives.3,4 We wish to report on the occurrence, now also in an _Aniba_ species, _A. gigantifolia_ O. C. Schmidt*, of tetrahydroderivatives: the known dihydrokawain (IIIa), dihydro-methysticin (IIIb)3 and tetrahydroiangonin (IIIc)4 and the new tetrahydro-11-methoxy-iangonin (IIId). Additionally, anibine (IV), the pseudoalkaloid of _A. duckei_ Kosterm., _A. rosaeodora_ Ducke and _A. coto_ (Rusby) Kosterm.2 was also found to be present.

The separation of type III compounds is notoriously difficult,3,4 and only partial separation of the crude C6H6 or EtOH extracts into sitosterol, a mixture, IIId and IV, in order of increasing polarity, was achieved by silica column chromatography. The mixture was resolved by fractional crystallization from C6H6 which gave pure IIIb in the first crop. The residual material was fractionated by careful chromatography on an alumina column. Light petrol.-Et2O eluted successively pure IIIa, pure IIIc and impure IIIb.

The structure of IIId was deduced from its PMR spectrum which was identical with the spectra of IIIa, IIIb and IIIc with the exception, of course, of the signals due to the protons and the substituents of the aromatic ring. The constitution of this ring was established through oxidation of IIId to veratric acid.

The absolute configuration of the _Piper_ products IIIa and IIIb is known.5 The ORD curve of a sample of IIIb ex _Piper methylsucum_ Forster, kindly supplied by Prof. R. Hansel, Freie Universitat Berlin, was superimposable on the analogous curves given by all type III constituents of _A. gigantifolia._ The same (6_S_)-configuration was consequently ascribed to all of them.

## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation of the constituents of_ Aniba gigantifolia. Powdered trunk wood (1*0 kg) was extracted successively with C6H6 and EtOH. The C6H6 extract (27*5 g), redissolved in a little C6H6, crystallized in the refrigerator. The crystals (IIIb, 4*5 g) were separated by filtration. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue was chromatographed on a column of Merck's Kieselgel 0*05-0*0*020 mm. C6H6 eluted sitosterol (100 mg), C6H6-AcOEt, 9:1 eluted a mixture (12 g), C6H6-AcOEt, 4:1 eluted IIId (6*5 g) and AcOEt-MeOH, 19:1 eluted IV (420 mg). The mixture was fractionally crystallized from C6H6 giving IIIb (9 g). The mother liquor was chromatographed on a column of Merck's alumina G. Light petrol.-Et2O 9:1 eluted IIIa (210 mg) and light petrol.-EtO2, 4:1 eluted IIIc (150 mg). Other fractions contained mixtures of IIIa, IIIb and IIIc. The EtOH extract (21*8 g) was treated in the same way as the C6H6 extract. IIIb (680 mg) crystallized directly. Sitosterol (120 mg), IIIa + IIIc (380 mg), IIIb (730 mg), IIId (790 mg) and IV (1*5 g) were obtained by chromatographic techniques.

* Herbarium specimen INPA (Manaus) 37397. The botanist W. Rodrigues, to whom we are indebted for the classification, reports that _A. gigantifolia_ has previously only been located at the Tapajos river (Para State, Brasil) and in Peru. Near Manaus, where our specimen was collected, occurs _A. hostmamiana_ (Nees) Mez, which differs from _A. gigantifolia_ only with respect to the pillosity of the ovary, a fact which makes distinction between the two species very difficult.
