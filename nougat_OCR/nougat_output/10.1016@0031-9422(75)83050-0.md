and steroidal compounds one of which was sistosterol (mmp, IR).

The CHCl3 extract gave a main mixed band (_R_7 062) by preparative TLC (Si gel G with CHCl3-EtOH, 9:1) not separable by crystallization or argentized TLC. NMR and MS indicated that the band was a mixture. Separation of the mixed acetylated methyl esters by GLC (2% XEUR0, on WHP (Aw-DMCS) with 30 ml/min N2 at 250') gave three peaks with \(K\)3s equivalent to the derivatives of oleanolic, trosolic and micrometer acids.

## Experimental

_Isolation of the alkaloids._ Finely powdered bark (5-7 kg) of _Nectandra megapatomica_ was percolated with cold EtOH giving, after evaporation, a resinous extract (1200 g). This extract (950 g) was treated with dil. aq. tartaric acid at pH 4 at 5deg for 15 hr and filtered. The filtrate (25 l) was extracted successively with hexane, C6H0, and CH2Cl2 at pH 4. Three more CH2Cl2 extractions were then made at pH 7 (by addition of NaHCO3) pH 9, pH 12 (by addition of Na2CO3) and pH 14 (by addition of NaOH). During the basification a semi-solid mass precipitated, and was separated at pH 14 by decantation. Little basic residue was obtained from the various organic extracts, but repeated Soxhlet extraction of the semi-solid mass with CH2Cl3 gave a brown residue (50 g) which exhibited 2 principal spots on TLC. The 2 components were separated by distribution between EUOAc and H2O, followed by evaporation for lyophilization. The water soluble component slowly crystallized and after recrystallization from _n_-propanol gave _N_-methyltryptamine (0-57 g) as needles mp 168-169. The alkaloid was identical with an authentic sample by TLC, mmp, IR and UV spectrometry. The NMR spectrum (100 MHz, D2O) showed: 2-80 (3H singlet, N-CH3) 3:29 (4H, A2B2, Ar CH2Cl2 N), 17: 7-8 (5H, multiplet, aromatic H) 5. The mass spectrum (Atlas, ion-source inlet, 70 eV) showed principal peaks at _n_/_v_/14 (100% M+), 161 (27), 160 (21), 131 (42), 130 (381, 117(16), 115 (12), 103 (22), 77 (25), 44 (100% CH2=N+HCH3).

The EtOHAc soluble component also crystallized on standing and after recrystallization from _n_-propanol gave 6-methoxy-N-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-b-carbonitrile (0-24 g) as rods, mp 183-184deg, IR \(\begin{equation*}{\mathrm{x}}{\mathrm{x}}_{{\mathrm{NH}}}^{{\mathrm{6}}{\mathrm{8}}{\mathrm{6}}{\mathrm{2}}{\mathrm{8}}{\mathrm{m}}}\end{equation*}\) (6-28 (m), 668 (m), 82-88 (s),
