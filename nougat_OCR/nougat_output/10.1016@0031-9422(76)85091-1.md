###### Abstract

The trunk wood of _Emmotum nitens_ (Icaciancacea) contains the aromatic sesquiterpenes (2R,3S)-2-hydroxy-3-(2'-hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethyl-1-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (emotin-F), 2-hydroxy-3-(2'-hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethylnaphthalene (emmotin-G) and 3-(2'-hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethyl-1,2-naphthoquinone (emmotin-H). The identity of the carbon skeletons of these emmoTins was proved by conversion of all three into an identical quinoxaline derivative. The nature of this skeleton and the absolute configuration of emmoTin-F, as well as of the previously described emmoTins A and B, was established by conversion of emmotin-F into (+)-occidol.

## Results and Discussion

_Emmotum nitens_ (Benth.) Miers, an arboreous Icaciancacea species, has a wide geographical distribution. A trunk wood sample from a specimen growing in the vicinity of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, contained two sesquiterpenoid tetralins, designated emmotin-A (**1a**) and -B (**1b**), and two sesquiterpenoid naphthalenes, designated emmotin-C (**2**) and -D (**3**). Their structural proposals were based mainly on PMR evidence, and, consequently, only the relative configurations for C-2 and C-3 of emmotin-A and -B were established. Allocation of the substituents to C-5, based on \({}^{13}\)C NMR evidence in the case of emmotin-A and -B, was considered a reasonable postulate also for emmotin-C and -D in the light of a probable biogenic relationship [1].

The chemical investigation of another trunk wood sample, collected from a specimen growing in the Linhares Reserve, Rio Doce, Espirito Santo, where the species is known as "faia", revealed three different compounds. Elemental analysis and MS MW determination indicated their formulae to be C15H2H2O3 (emmotin-F, **1c**), C15H18O2 (emmotin-G, **4a**) and C15H16O3 (emmotin-H, **5**).

Formation of a diacetate (**1d**) upon Ac2O-C3H5N acetylation at reflux temp and of a triol on NaBH4 reduction assigned the three oxygens of emmotin-F to two OH and one CO functions. The CO function must be substituted by a benzene ring and one of the carbinols. Evidence for conjugation with the benzene ring are UV (lmax 259 nm, \(\epsilon\) 11200) and IR (vmax 1680 cm-1) spectra, as well as ease of catalytic hydrogenolysis of emmotin-F to a diol (**6a**). Evidence for vicinality with a CHOH group was found in the formation of a red _o_-quinone (7) upon dehydrogenation of emmotin-F with Pd-C in refluxing xylene. Functionality and structural features of 7 were established by derivatization with _o_-phenylene-diamine to a quinoxaline, C21H18N2 (**8**). An isopropy group (t 7.47, \(t\), \(J\) 1.5 Hz [3H] and 4.53, \(q\), \(J\) 1.5 Hz [2H]) is present in this compound (**8**), as well as in a derivative (**9**) obtained by heating emmotin-F or its diacetate (**1d**) in TsOH-Ac2O, and shows the additional carboni of emmotin-F to be part of a hydroxypropyl unit.

These facts, in conjunction with the interpretation of the PMR spectrum, which was very similar to those of emmotin-A (**1a**) and -B (**1b**) (Table 1), led to the tentative classification of emmotin-F as the tetralene emmotin **1c**. Both emmotin-A diacetate (**1e**) [1] and emmotin-F diacetate (**1d**) were deacetoxylated on reduction with Zn. The derivative (**10a**), submitted successively to catalytic hydrogenolysis and saponification, gave (+)-occidol (**11b**), characterized by mp, optical rotation [2] and direct UV, IR and PMR spectral comparison with a sample of synthetic (+)-occidol kindly supplied by Dr. Y. Hirose, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tokyo, Japan. This correlation established not only the carbon skeleton and 3S-configuration, but also the 2R-configuration of emmotin-F, in view of the _trans_-diaxial relationship of H-2 and H-3, evidenced by PMR data (Table 1).

The ORD curve of emmotin-F is superimposable on those given by emmotins A (**1a**) and B (**1b**), compounds in which the substituents at C-2 and C-3 also are _trans_. All three tetralene emmotins, thus, possess identical absolute configurations. The constitution and absolute configuration of the previously mentioned diol can now be confidently formulated as **6a**. The racemates of **6a** and **10b** were prepared during a synthesis of (+)-krisinol (**6b**) [3]. The published data on these products, however, are insufficient to validate comparisons with our compounds.

If it is admitted, as a working hypothesis, that the carbon skeleton of emmotin-F prevails in emmotin-G and -H, only the respective formulae **4a** and **5** can represent these compounds. Indeed, emmotin-G is a naphthol (lmax 243 nm, \(e\) 53900; lmax1064254 nm, \(e\) 55200) with a pair of _o_-related protons (_t_ 2.82 and 2.92, doublets, \(J\) 8 Hz) and a pair of _p_-related _peri_-protons (_t_ 2.27 and 2.58, singlets); and emmotin-H is an _ortho_-naphtho-quinone (lmax 265 nm, \(e\) 40800; _vmax_ 1649 cm-1; intense red colour slowly discharged by addition of aq. Na2S2O4 to a CHCl3 solution) with a pair of _o_-related protons (_t_ 2.64 and 2.87, doublets, \(J\) 8 Hz) and a single _peri_-proton (_t_ 2.14, singlet).

As expected, acetylation of emmotin-G (to **4b**) caused a strong paramagnetic shift (D 0.59 ppm) of the H-1 singlet, and oxidation with Fremy's salt at room temperature yielded emmotin-H (**5**). Attempted direct acetylation of **5** under a variety of conditions led to mixtures. In contradistinction, either reductive acetylation in presence of zinc or acetylation of the quinoxaline derivative **12** gave good yields of isopropenyl compounds, **13** and **8** respectively. Since the dehydration product **8** is equally available from emmotin-F the initial hypothesis is correct, and also the emmotins G and H must possess the carbon skeleton of occidol (**11b**).

The 3S-configuration of the emmotins is typical of the natural eudecanme type sesquiterpenes. This fact suggests their biogenetic relationship with this class of compounds. It is, consequently, proposed that their biosynthesis, by analogy with that of occidol [4], should involve a one carbon shift by a dienol-benzene rearrangement of an eudesmane type precursor.
