16]. The assignments of chemical shifts for tetrahydrofuran carbons were assigned by direct comparison to that of laticiresinol [14] or using dihydrocubebin as a model compound (Table 1). An important effect observed on chemical shifts of aromatic carbons is due to a b-effect caused by the oxygen of the tetrahydrofuran ring on C-1 of compounds **1a** (137.0) and **1c** (137.2) as compared to dihydrocubebin (134.3), and a g-effect on carbons C-2/C-6 of **1a** (106.3/119.1) and **1c** (106.2/119.0) as compared to dihydrocubebin (108.1/121.9).

The accumulation of furofuran, tetrahydrofuran, dibenzylbutanedioi and dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans in seeds has been previously demonstrated in _V. venosa_[3]. Nevertheless, remarkable differences were observed in _V. elongata_ in which these lignans accumulate only in its pericraps, arils and seed coat, while in kernels the presence of aryltetralins and aryltetralone neoligans are ubiquitous [19].

The absolute configurations for all isolated lignans were established as 8_R_/8'_R_ from optical rotation signals and/or circular dichroism curves. Indeed, the biosynthetic sequence (+)-furofuran, (+)-tetrahydrofuran, (-)-butanediol and (-)-butyrolactone, involving the series 8_R_/8'_R_, has recently been proved to occur enzymically in _Forsythia intermedia_ plants [20] and might be the case in _Virola_ species, considering solely their absolute configurations.

## EXPERIMENTAL

_General._ Prep. TLC was carried out on Silica gel PF-254 (Merck) and Alumina GF-254 (Merck) and CC on Silica gel 60H (0.005-0.045 mm) (Merck) and Alumina-90 (Merck). Mps were obtained on Electrothermal equipment and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A-Carl Zeiss and CD with a dichrograph Jobin Yvon CD6. The 1H NMR (200 MHz) and 13C NMR (50 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker-AC 200 in CDCl3 with TMS as int. standard. EIMS were obtained at 70 eV on HP 5988-A.

_Plant material._ Seedlings of _V. michelii_ Heckel were collected in April of 1989, at Gaviao Reserve (INPA-WWF), Manaus-Caracarai Road, Amazonas State, Brazil. The specimen was identified by William Rodrigues, Departamento de Botanica, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (Manaus).

_Extraction and isolation of the constituents._ The dried kernels (24.98 g) of the seedling of _V. michelii_ were ground and exhaustively extracted with CH2Cl2 at room temp. The CH2Cl2 extracts were coned _in vacuo_ to give a brown mass (15.63 g, 62.6%). A portion of this extract (10 g) submitted to CC using solvents of increasing gradient of polarity (_n_-hexane, EtOAc and EtOH), gave different groups of frs (1-14). Frs 1-5 (2395 mg) contained a mixt. of non-polar materials that was not further investigated. Frs 6 and 7 (135 mg) were submitted to prep. TLC (CH2Cl2-Me2CO, 0.25%) to give (+)-sesamin (5.2 mg), (+)-fargesin (8.3 mg) and (-)-hinokinin (37.2 mg). Frs 8-12 (1321 mg) were subjected to CC on silica gel and eluted with CH2Cl2-Me2CO, MeOH to give frs A-N. Frs B-D yielded (-)-kusunokinin (688.6 mg) and frs E-G afforded (-)-dimethylmatrained (175.1 mg). Frs H and I were pooled and recrystallized with MeOH to give (+)-phillogenin (11.2 mg). Fr K was purified by prep. TLC (CH2Cl2-Me2CO, 5%) and yielded **1a** (4.7 mg) and (-)-3',4'-dimethoxy-3',4'-domethylenedioxycubebin (11.5 mg). Fr. L was purified by prep. HPLC (Lichrosorb RP-8 column; 250 x 22 mm; flow rate 12 ml min-1; detection at 254 nm) with H2O-MeOH [3:17 - 3:22 (30 min)] to give (-)-dihydrocubebin (2.0 mg). Frs 13 and 14 (562 mg) were subjected to CC on alumina _in vacuo_ using solvents of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2, Me2CO and MeOH) affording 8 frs (a-h). Fr. b and frs d and f afforded (-)-dimethylmatrained (27.6 mg) and (+)-laticiresinol dimethyl ether (1b, 21.8 mg), respectively. Frs g and h were purified by HPLC (Perkin-Elmer C-18 column; 250 x 4.5 mm; flow
