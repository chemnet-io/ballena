# Abstract

The branches of the shrub _Aniba lanicifolia_ Kubitzki et Rodrigues (Lauraceae) contain besides 2-hydroxy-4,5-dimethylbenzylbenzene and its dimer cyclohexan-2-allyl-5-en-4,5-dimethoxy-4-O-(2'-allyl-4',5'-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-one (lanclilin, **2**) 6 further novel neoligans: (4S,2'R)- and (4R,2'E)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4,5-dimethoxy-4-[2'-(1'-guaiacyl)-propyl]-1-one (lancifolins **A** and **B**, **3a** and **3b**), (4S,2'R)- and (4R,2'R)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4,5-dimethoxy-4-[2'-(1'-veratryl)-propyl]-1-one (lancifolins **C** and **D**, **3c** and **3d**), (4S,2'R)- and (4R,2'R)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4,5-dimethoxy-4-[2'-(1'-piperonyl)-propyl]-1-one (lancifolins **E** and **F**, **3e** and **3f**).

## INTRODUCTION

_Aniba lanicifolia_ Kubitzki et Rodrigues, to date known only from the type locality 130 km north of Manaus, is the sole species of its genus with shrubby habit and broadly cordate leaf bases. The rocky campina in which it was discovered would merit to be preserved as a relic, due not only to the very peculiar characteristics of its vegetation, but also to the wealth of endemic and rare species. Unfortunately, this area is at present being irreversibly destroyed, as many others in Amazonia [2].

Branches of the shrub were found to contain a simple allybenzene (**1a**) together with 7 related compounds belonging to two novel neolignan types in which two allybenzene units are linked either head to head by a 2.O.3' bridge (lanclilin type, **2**) or tail to head by a 8.3' bridge (lanclolin type, **3**).

Systematic nomenclature, which we have used so far for neoligans (cf. [3] and previous papers), detracts from the fact that, in spite of diversity of skeletons and functions, they form a singularly homogeneous bioge genetic group of natural compounds. This homogeneity is honoured in a system of nomenclature and numbering outlined in a recent review [4] which is adopted in the present paper.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Compound **1a**, C1H14O3, was characterized as a hydroxy-dimethylylenzene by 'H NMR. In this spectrum the aromatic protons are represented by singlets and hence are _para_-related. Among the three possible alternatives, the _meta_-dimethoxy structure can be excluded by MS evidence. Intense M-15 and M-15-28 peaks are typical of _ortho_- and _para_-dimethoxyphenzenes [5]. From the remaining alternatives **1a** was selected by analysis of the 'H NMR shifts upon acetylation which are closely comparable to analogous shifts for **1b**[6] (D_d

a rationale. The biosynthesis of both these types requires fundamentally only oxidation [3], while the biosynthesis of the lancifolins requires additionally hydride addition. The peculiar morphology of **_A. lancifolins_** thus corresponds to a characteristic chemistry.**

## Experimental

### Isolation of constituents.

Branches of a specimen (voucher herbarium INPA, Manaus, 43479), collected near km 130 of the Manaus-Caracari highway, were dried and their powder (3 kg) was percolated with EtOH. The extract (165 g) was washed exhaustively with CHCl3. CHCl3 was evaporated and residue (30 g) chromatographed on a Si gel column (400 g). Elution with the following solvents gave the indicated fractions: petrol-C6H6 1:1 (A), 3:7 (B, C), C6H6 (D to G). Fraction A (1.9 g) was composed of aliphatic esters. Fraction B (70 mg) was crystallized from MeOH to yield stosterol. Fraction C (4.3 g) was separated by TLC (Al2O3, petrol -C6H6. 1:9) into **3I** (120 mg) and a mixture of **3e** and **3I**. Fraction D gave by TLC (Si gel, CHCl3-Me2CO3, 9:1) **1a** (175 mg). Fraction E gave by TLC (Si gel, CdH6-EtOAc, 3:1) **2** (130 mg). Fraction F (850 mg) was separated by TLC (Al2O3, CdH6-EtOAc, 49:1) into **3c** (93 mg) and **3d** (72 mg). Fraction G (75 mg) was separated by TLC (Al2O3, C6H6-EtOAc, 24:1) into **3a** (9 mg) and **3b** (12 mg).
