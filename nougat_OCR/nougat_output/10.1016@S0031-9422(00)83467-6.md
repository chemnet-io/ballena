Alphonse Kelecom

# Abstract

20-Deoxocarnoosol, isolated from the stems of _Coleus barbatus_, was shown by chemical and spectral methods to be a new phenolic diterpene with an abietane skeleton.

## INTRODUCTION

As a part of our studies on the cardioactive dichloromethane crude extract of the false boldo, _Coleus barbatus_ Bentham (Labiate) [1-3], we isolated a new diterpene, 20-deoxcernosol (1), as a crystalline light yellow solid [mp 173.5-175.5deg; [_a_]D = - 78.7deg (1.00, CHCl3); yield: 0.06 % from dry planti material]. I wish to report now on the structure elucidation of 1.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

High resolution mass spectrometry of 1 established the empirical formula \(\text{C}_{20}\text{H}_{28}\text{O}_{3}\) (316.2056, requires 316.2039). The IR spectrum showed the presence of hydroxyl functions (_v_max 3560 and 3480 cm-1) that underwent acetylation to furnish a diacetate 2 devoid of further hydroxyl absorptions in the IR spectrum. IR (_v_max 1765 cm-1) and 1H NMR spectral data (_d_2.29 and 2.30, OAc) of 2 suggested the phenolic nature of both hydroxyl groups in 1. The UV spectrum of 1 confirmed the latter conclusion and indicated that the hydroxyl groups were not _para_ to each other [4]. The _ortho_ relationship between them came from Ag2O oxidation of 1 into the unstable _o_-quinone 3 identified by its IR and UV spectra [2,5] (_v_max 1670 and 1650 cm-1; _a_max 222, log \(e\)3.76 and 428 nm, log \(e\)3.28). The pentabusubstituted nature of the aromatic ring range from 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data (1H, _br s_ at \(d\)6.58; six aromatic carbons _5s_ and _1d_, see Table 1). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 also showed signals for two methyl groups on a quaternary carbon (two 3H, \(s\) at \(d\) 0.86 and 1.14) and for an isopropyl group (6H, \(d\),_J_ = 7 Hz at 5.125 and 11 H _hept_, \(J\) = 7 Hz at \(d\)3.16). The small upfield shift (_d_d_0.24 ppm) of the isopropyl methine signal, observed on acetylation, indicated that the isopropyl group was linked to the phenol moiety. Moreover, the non-equivalence of the isopropyl methyl groups in the 1H NMR spectrum of diacetate 2 (two 3H, \(d\), \(J\) = 7 Hz at \(d\)1.17 and 1.21) suggested that a hydroxyl was probably vicinal to the isopropyl group of 1. These data allowed three different arrangements of the aromatic substituents (A-C). Among them, **B** could be eliminated since **1** gave a

positive Gibbs test [6], and C was discarded mainly on biogenetic grounds since several abietane diterpenes had already been isolated from stems [2, 3] and leaves [7-9] of _C. barbatus_. Fragment A accommodates with an abietane (A1) but also with a semi-perity type compound (A2). The latter could be discarded since the 1b-H of 1 was found to be deshielded to d 2.65 due to the 'rabbit-ear effect' [5] of the hydroxyl group at C-11. Additional support for the abietane skeleton was obtained from the 13CNMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) which also showed that the third oxygen atom of 1 was part of a -CH-O-CH2- ether moiety (_d_ 71.11, \(d\) and 68.48, _dd_). This was further substantiated by the poorly resolved _dd_ at \(d\) 4.72 (_J_ = 3.9 and 1.5 Hz) for the H-7 and by the AB quartet observed at \(d\) 3.08 and 4.31 (1H each, \(d\), \(J\) = 9 Hz) attributable to the hydrogens of the oxymethylene moiety. The greater than 1 ppm difference in chemical shifts proved that the latter two hydrogens were in very different environments, and suggested that one hydrogen points towards and the other away from the aromatic ring, a requirement only compatible with the ether being located at C-20. Comparison of the 13CNMR spectral data of the methyl groups of 1, with those of ferruginol (4) [10, 11] (Table 1) confirmed this assignment. This structure was also supported by the mass spectrum of 1 which was dominated by an ion at _m_/_z_ 286 corresponding to the loss of a CH2O fragment from the molecular ion, and it is known that the fragmentation giving rise to the base peak, in the abietatriene series, is the loss of the C-10 substituent [12]. Furthermore, both the chemical shift and the multiplicity of the signal at \(d\) 4.72 indicated that the cyclic ether of 1 closed at the C-7 benzylic position. A Dreiding model showed that, in an abietane derivative, any six-membered ring from C-20 to C-7 necessarily creates an _a_-oriented H-7. This orientation was further confirmed by the coupling constants of the C-7 hydrogen [13]. Hence, 1 is _7b_, 20-oxidoabieta-8,11,13-trien-11,12-diol and it is thus the 20-deoxy derivative of carnosed (5) [13, 14]. Additional support for the proposed structure was furnished by the large _g_-gauche effect observed in the 13CNMR spectra of 1 and 2 on C-5, shielded by _ca_ 8 ppm, and the important _anti_-periplanar effect on C-1, shielded by _ca_ 9 ppm from their positions in 4 (Table 1). In turn, C-10 was deshielded by _ca_ 3 ppm.

Since compounds 1 and 5 possess identical asymmetric carbons, the molecular rotation of 1 ([*]D = -248.7deg) strongly supported the proposal that 1 has the same absolute configuration as 5 ([*]D = -249.9deg) [15], i.e. 1 belongs to the normal series, a conclusion also arrived at from biogenetic considerations [2, 3]. It is peculiar to note that, although 20-deoxyacronosol (1) and 6b-hydroxycarnosol (6) [3] are both found in _C. barbatus_, no carnosol (5) could be detected in this plant.

## Experimental

All the equipment used for this work has been described previously [2].

_Isolation of 20-deoxyacronosol_ (1). _Coleus barbatus_ Bentham was collected in the surroundings of Rio de Janeiro during October 1981. Leaves and stems were separated, air-dried, and the stems pulverized in a hammer mill. The stems (1 kg) were extracted successively with hexane, EtOAc and MeOH at room temp. for several days. The hexane crude extract was evaporated under red. pres. to afford a brownish residue (21 g) which was dissolved in MeOH (50 ml). The insoluble material (7 g) was filtered off and the filtrate second to a vol. of 10 ml. Aliquots of 2 ml were applied on a Sephadex LH-20 column (200 ml bed volume) eluted with pure MeOH. 20-Deoxcamosol (1) was eluted from the column together with (+)-ferruginol (4), barbatusol [2], _6b_-hydroxycarnosol (6) [3] and several other minor diterpenes. Silica gel column chromatography (eluted with a gradient of EtOAc from 10 to 25% in hexane) afforded 1 still contaminated with

another unknown diterpene. Crystallizations from hexane-CH2Cl2 afforded 585 mg of pure 1 as a light-yellow solid, mp 173.75-175.5deg; [a] = - 78.8deg (589), - 82.6deg (578), - 94.8deg (546), - 169.1deg (436) and - 287.4deg (365 nm) (_c_1.00, CHCl2); IR \(\frac{\text{v}\text{lim}}{\text{max}}\) cm-1: 3550 and 3480 (OH), 2950, 2860, 1602, 1450, 1290, 1050, 1030 and 998; UV \(\frac{\text{M}\text{M}\text{M}\text{M}\text{M}}{\text{M}\text{M}\text{M}}\) nm: 224 (log \(e\) = 3.78) and 278 (3.15) shifted to 224 (3.83), 248 (3.74) and 291 (3.43) in alkaline MeOH; MS _m_/_z_ (rel. int.) 316.2056 (C20H28O3 requires 316.2039, 14), 301 (5), 299 (5), 286 [M - CH2O]+ (100), 271 (14), 243 (8), 215 (32); 1H NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): d 0.86 (3 H, s, 19-Me), 1.14 (3H, s, 18-Me), 1.25 (6H, \(d\), \(J\) = 7 Hz, 16-Me and 17-Me), 2.65 (1H, \(m\), H-1\(\beta\)), 3.08 (1H, \(d\), \(J\) = 9 Hz, H-20), 3.16 (1H, _hept_, \(J\) = 7 Hz, H-15), 4.31 (1H, \(d\), \(J\) = 9.0 Hz, H'-20), 4.72 (1H, _dd_, \(J\) = 3.9 and 1.5 Hz, H-7), 604 and 6.20 (each 1H, \(m\), disappear on D2O addition, two OH) and 6.58 (1H, _br_, s, sharpens on D2O addition, H-14); 13C NMR (25.2 MHz, CDCl3); see Table 1.

_Acetylation of 20-deoxyacornosol._ 20-Deoxocarnosol (1,85 mg) in pyridine (2 ml) was treated at room temp. with Ac2O (2 ml). After 3.5 hr, the reaction medium was diluted with H2O and extracted with CHCl3. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under high vacuum. The crude material (92 mg) was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-EtOAc from 95:5 to 80:20). Diacetate **2** was obtained pure (82 mg), [a] = - 36.6deg (589), - 38.3deg (578), and - 43.8deg (546 nm) (_c_ = 1.19 in CHCl3); IR \(\frac{\text{v}\text{lim}}{\text{max}}\) cm-1: 2940, 1770 (>C=O), 1450, 1365, 1320, 1210, 1185, 1130, 1047, 1030, 1010, 885 and 864; UV \(\frac{\text{v}\text{lim}}{\text{max}}\)H+ nm (log \(e\) = 222 (3.59) and 260 (2.69) MS _m_/_z_ (rel. int.) 400 (C24H3O3, _th_, 6), 370 (16), 364 (2), 358 (8), 328 (48), 316 (12), 286 [M - CH2O, two CH2CO]+ (100), 215 (14); 1H NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): d 0.85 (3H, s, 19-Me), 1.15 (3H, s, 18-Me), 1.17 and 1.21 (3H each, \(d\), \(J\) = 7 Hz, 16-Me and 17-Me), 2.29 and 2.31 (3H each, \(s\), two OAc), 2.94 (1H, _hept_, \(J\) = 7 Hz, H-15), 306 (1H, \(d\), \(J\) = 9 Hz, H-20), 4.38 (1H, \(d\), \(J\) = 9 Hz, H'-20), 4.79 (1H, _dd_, \(J\)69/78 = 4 Hz and \(J\)69/78 = 1.5 Hz, H-7) 7.02 (1H, \(s\), _H_-14); 13C NMR (25.2 MHz, CDCl3); see Table 1.

_Oxidation of 20-deoxyacornosol._ 20-Deoxocarnosol (1,10 mg) in dry THF (5 ml) was oxidized with Ag2O (25 mg) at room temp. during 15 min. The reaction medium turns gradually from yellow to deep red. Filtration of the solids followed by evaporation under red. pres. afforded crude _o_-quinone (3) which was purified by preparative TLC developed with hexane-EtOAc (85:15).
