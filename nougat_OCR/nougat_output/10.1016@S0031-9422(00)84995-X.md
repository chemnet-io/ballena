and the compounds should thus be stereoisomers. The close correspondence of the 1H and 13C NMR signals assigned to the cyclohexanone part of the structures indicates that the difference resides in the configuration of C-2 or C-3. Indeed, the compounds differ only in the 2,3-_cis_ (**3a**) and 2,3-_trans_ (**3b**) arrangement of the aryl/methyl substituents, as shown by the 1H NMR Me-doublets (_J_ = 8 Hz) at \(d\)0.77 versus 0.96, respectively. The sole other conspicuous difference in these spectra refers to the H-2 doublets (_J_ = 10 Hz) at \(d\)5.40 versus 4.67, respectively. This indicates the association of H-2 with the oxygen atom of HO-7a only in **3a** which thus must sustain both substituents in the _syn_-configuration; in contradistinction to **3b** where H-2 and HO-7a occupy opposite sides of the molecule. As is consequently to be expected, the 13C NMR spectrum reveals hydroxyl-7a to contribute _g_-effects on C-2 (_d_d_81.7) and C-3 (_d_44.3) of **3a**, but not on C-2 (_d_88.7) of **3b**. However, the configurations of C-3 in both compounds are identical and it is less easy to rationalize the fact that as C-2, C-3 (_d_50.3) of **3b** also does not feel the _g_-effect due to hydroxyl-7a. The H-2, H-3 coupling constants for both compounds are rather large (_ca_ 10 Hz) and the H-2-H-3 dihedral angle thus must be close to 0deg in **3a** and close to 180deg in **3b**. Models of the compounds, constructed considering also this conformational information, indicate the possible existence of a hydrogen bridge between the oxygen at C-7a and the aryl at C-2. This preferential orientation of the hydroxyl towards the aryl in **3b** impedes the transmission of the _g_-effect from its oxygen to C-3.

The allelic methylene carbons of **3a** and **3b** are shielded (_d_40.1, 39.6, respectively) in comparison with the analogous group of the model compound **4** (_d_43.9) [7] and thus occur most probably in a _syn_-relationship with the methyls at C-3. Indeed these substituents appear to be shielded reciprocally if **3a** and **3b** (_d_10.6, 9.4, respectively) are again compared with the model compound **4** (_d_12.0) [7].

The relative stereochemistries which thus result for ferrerain-B (**3a**) and C (**3b**) differ from those originally proposed for ferrerain-A (**5a**) and B (**5b**) [6]. The structures of the two latter compounds thus must be revised respectively to **3c** and **3a**. The model compound (**6**) on which the previous assignments were based lacks

the hemiketalic hydroxyl at C-7a shown in the present paper to be of essential importance in the interpretation of NMR data.

The ferrearins are devoid of oxygenation at one of the two ring-carbons _para_ related to a C-3 substituent. As for only-2,3,4,7,7-_hexachlorhydro-7-oxobenzofuran_ (3a, _fererearin-B_), other neolignan types which share this biosynthetically interesting feature [6] their genesis from properly- and allyliphenol derived radicals (7 and 8, respectively) might thus involve an allylic rearrangement (9 - 10; Scheme 1).

## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation of the constituents._ Trunk wood of _O. actiphylla_ (Nees) Mez, identified by Prof Jose Elas de Paula, Universidade de Brasilia, was dried, powdered (3.9 kg) and extracted with petrol. The solvent was evapd and the residue (44 g) crystallized from MeOH to pure 1 (2.4 g) and other less pure fractions. The mother liquor was evapd and the residue (30 g) was submitted to dry CC (300 g silica gel +10% H2O, C6H6-EtOAc 4:1). The column was divided into 10 equal portions which were eluted separately with Me2CO. The eluates of portions 2 + 3 (6 8 g) were crystallized from MeOH to 3b (180 mg). The eluate of proton 4 (34 g) was purified by CC and repeated TLC (silica gel) to 2b (10 mg). The eluates of portions 5 + 6 + 7 (12 6 g) were separated by an analogous procedure into 3a (30 mg) and 2a (10 mg).
