# Abstract

_Plants. Derris floribunda_ (Benth.) Ducke, trivial name "timbo venenoso", _D. amazonica_ Killip, trivial name "timbo-rana" and _D. urucu_ (Killip et Smith) Macbr., trivial name "timbo urucu", "timbo verdadeiro" ("="true timbo") [2], were collected in the vicinity of Manaus, Amazonas, and identified by the botanist W. Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus. _Constituents of_ D. floribunda. Powdered root (1:3 kg) was extracted with petrol. The CHCl3-soluble portion (22 g) of the extract (30 g) was chromatographed on silica (600 g) giving the following fractions with the indicated eluants: A1 (petrol-C6H6 9:1), A2, A3 (C6H6), A4-A7 (C6H6-CHCl3 9:1). A1 was crystallized from petrol giving 3,5-dimethoxy-4-prenylstiline (1a, 40 mg), mp and mmp with an authentic sample from _D. rariflora_ (Mart.) Macbr. [3] 84-86deg. A2 was crystallized from petrol giving Ion-chocarpin (2a, 40 mg), mp and mmp with an authentic sample from _D. sericea_ (H.B.K.) Ducke [4] 108-109deg. A3 was crystallized from petrol giving 3,5,4'-trimethoxy-4-prenylstilbene (1b, 30 mg). A4 was crystallized from petrol giving derricidin (25 mg), mp and mmp with an authentic sample from _D. sericea_ [4] 115-116deg. A5 was crystallized from petrol-C6H6 giving isocordoin (40 mg), all data, incl. mp 162-163deg, as reported for a sample from an undetermined _Lonchocarpus_ sp. [5] A0 was crystallized from C6H6 giving 5,7-dihydroxy-6-prenylflavanone (35 mg), mp and mmp with an authentic sample from _D. rariflora_ [3] 212-214deg. A7 was crystallized from C6H6 giving 4-hydroxylochocarpin (2b, 30 mg), 1st crop, and a mixture of 2b and possibly 2c, 2nd crop.

The PMR spectrum of the diacetate (**2d**) showed all the expected features [_t_(CDCl3): 2:47 (_d_, \(J\) 15 Hz, H-b), 2:46 (~ \(d\), \(J\) 9 Hz, H-2, H-6, H-6'), 2:56 (_d_, \(J\) 15 Hz, H-z), 2:88 (~ \(d\), \(J\) 9:0 Hz, H-3, H-5), 3:30 (_d_, \(J\) 9:0 Hz, H-5'), 3:65 (_d_, \(J\) 10 Hz, H-4"), 4:30 (_d_, \(J\) 10 Hz, H-5"), 7:72 (s, 2 COMe), 8:57 (_s_, 2 Me-6"). This compound occurs also in an unidentified _Lonchocarpus_ sp. [6].

_Constituents of_ D. amazonica. Powdered aerial wood (08 kg) of the creeper was extracted with EtOH. The C6H6-soluble portion (3 g) of the extract (27 g) was chromatographed on silica (450 g). Elution with solvent of increasing polarity gave, in succession, sitosterol (20 mg), (3S)-2'-O-methylvestitol (3b) (15 mg), lupenone (20 mg). lupeol (10 mg) and (6aS,11aS)-demethylhomoptercorapin (20 mg), mp and mmp with an authentic sample from _Dalbergia decipularis_ Rizz. et Matt.

Comparison of the IR [_v_max (cm-1): 3360, 1600, 1585, 1495, 835], PMR [_t_(CDCl3): 3:05 (_d_, \(J\) 9 Hz, H-5 or H-6'), 3:16 (_d_, \(J\) 9 Hz, H-6' or H-5), 3:45-380 (_m_, H-6, 8, _3', _5'_), 4:58 (s, OH), 5:75 (_dd_, \(J\) 9, 3:5 Hz, H_eq-2), 5:97 (_d_, \(J\) 9 Hz, _H__ax_-2), 6:24 (s, 2 OMe), 6:30-690 (_m_, H-3), 7:15 (_d_, \(J\) 7 Hz, ArCH2) and ORD [(c 2 mg/100 ml. EtOH, 300-274 nm) [_ph_]298 0, [_ph_]274 -2800, [_ph_]274 -4500] curves with the analogous curves of **3a** [8, 9] revealed the compound as a hydroxydimethoxyisoflavan of identical absolute configuration and oxygenation pattern. Base peak of the MS [(_m_/_e_): 286 (91%) M, 164 (100), 152 (36), 151 (91), 149 (59), 135 (9), 121 (54)] was compatible only with a dimethyl-oxidated B-ring and identified the compound with the 2'-O-methyl derivative of (3S)-vestitol (3b).

_Constituents of_ D. urucu. Powdered aerial wood (3:4 kg) of the creeper was extracted with EtOH. The extract was chromatographed on silica giving the following fractions with the indicated eluants: \(A\)1 (light petrol.). A2 (CHCl3). A1 was rechromatographed on silica giving, upon elution with solvent of increasing polarity, in succession, aliphatic acids (1:5 g, mp 70-72deg), rotenone (**4a**, 6 g), mp and mmp with an authentic sample 162-164deg [10], and 6a.12a-dchydroxtenone (0:6 g), mp and mmp with a sample prepared by treatment of rotenone with I2-AcONa 228-230deg [10]. A2 was rechromatographed on silica giving, upon elution with solvent of increasing polarity, 3-methoxy-8,9-methylenedioxy-6a,11a-dehydropterocarpan (26 mg), all data, incl. mp 179-180deg, as reported for a sample of hemi-chapparin-B [11], and a mixture of 12a-hydroxy-rotenone and tephrosin. (**4b** + **4c**, 0:5 g).

12a-_Hydroxyrotenone_ (**4b**) _and tephrosin_ (**4c**), crystals, mp 80-84deg (one TLC-spot upon devel with several solvent systems). The nature of the mixture was indicated by MS [(_m_/_e_): 410 (52deg) M, 209 (29), 208 (100), 207 (37), 203 (21), 193 (8), 187 (8), 181 (10), 165 (10). Acetate, (_m_/_e_): 452 (41dego) M, 393 (12), 392 (29), 250 (94), 208 (100), 207 (29), 203 (9), 194 (9), 193 (11), 192 (29), 191 (9), 187 (18), 182 (24), 181 (12), 165 (12), 159 (53), 151 (17)]. The respective proportion, 65:35, of its components was determined by PMR [_t_(CDCl3), **4b**: 2:20 (_d_, \(J\) 8 Hz, H-11), 3:45 (s, H-1), 3:50 (_d_, \(J\) 8 Hz, H-10), 3:55 (s, H-4), 4:80 (_ad_, \(J\) 9, 8 Hz, OCH). 5:00 (_m_, =CH2), 5:30-5:70 (_m_, H-6a, 2H-6, OH), 6:22 (s, OMe), 6:30 (s. OMe), 6:78 (_dd_, \(J\) 16, 9 Hz H-1'), 7:08 (_dd_, \(J\) 16, 8 Hz, ArCH2), 8:22 (s, = CMe). **4c**: 2:30 (_d_, \(J\) 8 Hz. H-11), 3:45 (s, H-1), 3:45 (_d_, \(J\) 10 Hz. ArCH=), 3:55 (s, H-4), 3:60 (_d_, \(J\) 8 Hz, H-10), 4:45 (_d_, \(J\) 10 Hz, =CH), 5:30-5:70 (_m_, H-6a. 2H-6), 6:22 (s, OMe), 6:30 (s, OMe), 8:55 (_s_, OMe). Resolution of all PMR features was achieved in the spectrum of the mixture of the acetates (also one TLC-spot) [_t_(CDCl3), **4d**: 2:16 (_d_, \(J\) 8 Hz, H-11), 3:12 (s, H-1), 3:45 (_d_, \(J\) 8 Hz, H-10), 3:54 (s, H-4), 4:59 (_dd_, \(J\) 4, 2 Hz, H-6a), 4:80 (_dd_, \(J\) 9, 8 Hz, OCH), 5:00 (_m_, =CH2), 5:42 (_dd_, \(J\) 13, 4 Hz, H-6), 5:72 (_dd_, \(J\) 13, 2 Hz, H-6), 6:20 (_s_, OMe), 6:23 (s, OMe). 6:73 (_dd_, \(J\) 16, 9 Hz, ArCH), 7:07 (_dd_, \(J\) 16, 8 Hz, ArCH), 7:80 (s, COMe), 8:21 (s,

=CMe). **4e**: 2:28 (_d, J_ 8 Hz, H-11), _3:12_ (s, H-1), 3:42 (_d, J_ 10 Hz, ArCH=), 3:54 (s, H-4), 3:60 (_d, J_ 8 Hz, H-10), 4:45 (_d, J_ 10 Hz, =CH), 4:59 (_dd, J_ 4, 2 Hz, H-6a), 5:42 (dd, \(J\) 13, 4 Hz, H-6), 5:72 (_dd, J_ 13, 2 Hz, H-6), 6:20 (s, OMe). 6:23 (s, OMe). 7:80 (_s_, COMe), 8:54 (_s_, CMe), 8:60 (CMe)]. The PMR data show that the stereochemistry of both components is unexceptional [10]. Reflux of the mixture in 10% methanolic H2SO4 (40 min) gave a product from which only 6a,12a-dehydrotactone was isolated by TLC.

_Plant--Byrosonima verbascifolia_ (L.) Rich. (Malpighiaceae), trivial name "murici", was collected near Brasilia, D.F., and identified by the botanists A. P. Duarte and C. T. Rizzini. _Bark_. The C6H6 extract (134 g _ex_ 11 kg) was recrystallized from MeOH giving \(\beta\)-amyrin (120 g). The mother-liquor was evaporated and the residue (14 g) was chromatographed on silica. Elution with solvent of gradually increasing polarity gave fractions which, after crystallization from the indicated solvents, gave sitosterol (MeOH-CHCl3, 165 mg), friedelin (MeOH-CHCl3, 67 mg), 3-_O_-acetyloleanolic acid (EtOAc, 51 mg), \(\beta\)-amyrin (500 mg), \(\beta\)-amyrenone (MeOH-CHCl3, 16 mg), 3-_O_-acetyllupeol (MeOH-CHCl3, 220 mg) and glochlorone (MeOH-CHCl3, 65 mg). \(\beta\)-Amyrenone was identified by direct comparison with a sample prepared by oxidation of \(\beta\)-amyrin with Jones reagent. Glochlorone was identified by direct comparison with an authentic sample _ex Glochidium_ sp. (Euphorbiaceae) [1] kindly supplied by Prof. T. R. Govindachari.
