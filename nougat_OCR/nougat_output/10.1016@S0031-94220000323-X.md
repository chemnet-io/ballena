###### Abstract

Two _C,O_-diglycosylated compounds, the anthrone picraminoside F, and the oxanthrone mayoside C, were isolated from the stem bark of _Picramnia taepensis_, along with the previously reported anthraquinones, 1-_O_-b-d- and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin. The compounds were separated by recycling-HPLC, and their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. CD measurements were used to establish the absolute configuration of the anthrone and oxanthrone. The antifungal activity of 1-_O_-b- and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ was shown to be similar to that of the lignan sesamin. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

## 1 Introduction

In a previous paper (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) we reported the isolation and characterization of two _C_-glycosylated anthrones (picraminosides D, E), and two _C_-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B), as well as emodin and umbelliferone, from the stem bark of _Picramnia taepensis_ Tul., a tree found in Central America. Further investigations afforded, in minor quantities, two new _C,O_-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picraminoside F (**1**), and an anthrone, mayoside C (**2**), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**3**) and 8-_O_-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against _Leuco Agaricus gongilophorus_ (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of compounds **1** and **2**, and the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.

## 2 Results and discussion

The EtOAc extract from the bark of _P. taepensis_ afforded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds **1**-**4**, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shimadzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones **3** and **4** were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989; Coskun et al., 1990; Inoue et al., 1992).

Compound **1** was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum exhibited pseudo-molecular ions at \(m/z\) 671 ([M+1]\({}^{+}\)), 693 ([M+Na]\({}^{+}\)) and 709 ([M+K]\({}^{+}\)), with the base peak at \(m/z\) 509 ([M+1-C6H10O5]\({}^{+}\)). The corresponding molecular formula, C33H34O15, was consistent with the \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectroscopic data.



## Page 2

All of the spectroscopic characteristics of **1** were coincident with those of anthrones which we have previously reported (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at _l_max 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cm\({}^{-1}\)), ester carbonyl (1735 cm\({}^{-1}\)) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cm\({}^{-1}\)) groups. The \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at \(d\) 7.4-7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of _meta_-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at \(d\) 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at \(d\) 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at \(d\) 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at \(d\) 3.40-3.95, indicating sugar moieties.

The presence of 33 carbons was evident from the \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at \(d\) 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at \(d\) 95.8 and \(d\) 105.4. Signals in the region of \(d\) 62-81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D-E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agreement with lyxose (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on Solis et al. (1995) which identified the sugar of picramniosides A-C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-_O_ were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments confirmed only one CH\({}_{2}\) signal at \(d\) 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit.

Complete assignment of the \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In particular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) \({}^{3}J\) coupling between the ester carbonyl (_d_ 164.7) and H-1\({}^{\prime}\), H-2\({}^{\prime\prime}\) and H-6\({}^{\prime\prime}\), indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-1\({}^{\prime}\) of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) \({}^{3}J\) coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-5\({}^{\prime}\) (_d_ 81.4), confirming the position of the aglycone at C-5\({}^{\prime}\) of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a \({}^{3}J\) correlation of the anomeric

## Page 3

proton of the glucose unit (H-1, \(d\) 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the _O_-glucose unit at C-8.

The magnitude of the coupling constant between H-5' and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. The configuration of the lysrose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (Solis et al., 1995; Hernandez-Medel et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-1' and H-2' (_J_ = 0 Hz) suggesting an _eq_-_eq_ conformation for these protons. Likewise, the \(J\) value of H-5'' (12 Hz) indicated an _ax_-_ax_ conformation for H-5'' and H-4'' in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety.

Further observations helped to establish the configuration at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of **1** (1H and 13C NMR) were almost identical to those of picraminoside E (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the following expected differences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to _O_-glucosylation at C-8.

Compound **2** was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of **2** gave pseudo-molecular ions at _m_/_z_ 709 ([M + Na]+) and 725 ([M + K]+). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H]-), which was consistent with the molecular formula C33H34O16. The daughter ions, from an MS-MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (_m_/_z_ 563), lysose (_m_/_z_ 432), CH2OH (_m_/_z_ 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corresponding to emodin (269).

As observed previously for the mayosides (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1996, 1999; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed the same pattern described for **1**, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of **2** had almost identical 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). _O_-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound **2** at ring A.

Asignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with published data (Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not afford all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1'' with C-1 (_d_ 162) helped to confirm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1''.

Circular dichroism confirmed the absolute configuration at C-10 of **1** and **2** as \(S\) and \(R\), respectively. The CD data of

**1** and **2** presented the same Cotton effects as picraminoside B and E (Solis et al., 1995; Rodriguez-Gamboa et al., 1999) and saroside (Hernandez-Medel et al., 1999), namely a negative Cotton effect near 270 and 315 nm, and a positive Cotton effect near 350 nm.

The compounds mayoside B, picraminoside E, **3**, **4**, emodin and umbelliferone were tested in the growth inhibition assay of _Leucoagaricus gongilophorus_, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. (1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds **3** and **4** presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in _Sesamm indicum_. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material.

## 3 Experimental

### General

Mp: uncorr.; IR: BOMEM-FT-IR; UV: Hewlett Packard 8452A; 1H NMR, COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HSQC, HMBC and 13C NMR, in methanol-_d__a_, containing TMS as int. standard: Bruker DRX-400; ESIMS: Micromass Quattro LC, HRMS: Autospec-Micromass EBE.

### Plant material

The bark of _P. taepensis_ was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San Jose de la Montana, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica.

### Isolation of constituents

Dried and powdered bark of _P. taepensis_ (615 g) was macerated with EtOH-H2O (4:1, v/v). The extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H2O and CHCl3. The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then _n_-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID x 50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml min-1 UV detector at 254 nm), to afford compound **1** (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-_O_-b- **(3)** and 8-_O_-b-glucopyranosyl emodin (**4**). Further purification of **3** (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and **4** (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described). Fraction 11 was submitted to HPLC separation under the same conditions (6.5 ml min-1, 7 cycles) to afford pure compound **2** (1.2 mg, 0.0004% w/w).
