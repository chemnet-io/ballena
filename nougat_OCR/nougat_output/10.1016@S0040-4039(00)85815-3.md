Summary : With the help of Natural Abundance 13C - 13C Coupling Constants, observed

via double quantum coherence, the structural determination of VELLOZIOLONE (1), a

new diterpene, has been carried out.

During the course of a continuing phytochemical survey of Brazilian Velloziaceae, we have examined a sample of Vellozia caput-adeae L.B. Smith & Ayensu, a species occuring in Diaman-

tina, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from which a new diterpene, vellozione (1) was iso-

lated.With the help of 'INADEQUATE' n.m.r. experiments 1 we establish herein its structure.To

our knowledge, this example is the first application of the two-dimensional Freeman technique
1b

for studying a naturally occurring substance of unknown constitution.

The molecular formula of velloziolone (1), (C20H3202), m.p. 113-114degC, 589

578 546 436 365 -60.8 -70.8 -135.2 -276.9 (c 0.83, CHC13), was determined by microanalysis and by mass spectrometry [ m/e 304.2377 (M*)].Its 100 MHz 1H n.m.r. spectrum (CDC13) showed the following clearly resolved signals : three methyl singlets at 0.75, 0.92 and 1.15 ppm and two ole-

finic protons at 4.92 and 5.02 ppm.Based on conventional carbon-13 n.m.r. data (Table), on the

results given above and on the structure of other compounds isolated from Vellozia species 2,

two different seco-ent-kaurena-16-eno structures (1) and (2) were considered as a working hypo-

thesis for the new diterpene.

Carbon-13 n.m.r. spectral analysis of velloziolone was first attempted at 50.31 MHz with a

Bruker WM-200 spectrometer.The double quantum pulse sequence was used 1a.This allowed the detection of carbon-carbon coupling constants at natural abundance with suppression of the strong signals from molecules with a single carbon-13 nucleus.Although, a number of matching satellite

pairs were identified from this experiment, the structure of velloziolone (1) could not be established.Ambiguities were due to the close chemical shift of some resonances (Table) and especially to coupled nuclei forming strong AB systems with reduced satellite intensities 3.Therefore, the spectral study was attempted again at 100.62 MHz with a Bruker WM-400 spectrometer.

A solution of velloziolone (1) was prepared in dioxan-dg [ 850 mg of (1) in 1 ml solvent].As a preliminary experiment, first an APT-type spectrum was measured 4.This defines the multiplicity

(number of bound protons) for each carbon signal and allows the determination of the maximum number of carbon connectivities possible for each carbon atom.Then, the double quantum pulse sequence was optimized for \({}^{1}\)JCC = 44 Hz (JCC = 1/4) in order to observe coupling constants for both sp3-sp3 and sp2-sp3 type linkages with the maximum intensity in one experiment.Data was accumulated at 95degC overnight using a recycle time of 4.33 sec.The number of data points was 16K with a frequency range of 6040 Hz giving a digital resolution of 0.75 Hz/point.Resolution enhancement with the Gaussian multiplication technique was applied 5.

Analysis of the results permitted to recognize 17 one-bond and 1 two-bond matching satellite pairs (Table and Figure).Although, this ID-INADEQUATE experiment suggested structure (1) for velloziolone, 5 one-bond coupling constants (J8,9 * J11,9 * J13,16 * J15,16 and J16,17) were missing from the spectrum based on formula (1).A choice between structures (1) and (2) was extremely simple with the help of this powerful new n.m.r. technique.For instance the latter structure would imply the 73.69 ppm carbon signal to be coupled with three methylene type carbon resonances.However, inspection of the spectral data indicates clearly that the neighbours of the 73.69 ppm carbon signal are a methine, a methylene and a methyl type resonance, in agreement with structure (1).

Missing satellites were due to carbon atoms involved in bonds with each of the two carbon atoms C-9 and C-16, expected to have especially long relaxation times.It has been shown previously that couplings to carbons exhibiting long T1 values were suppressed or have given strongly reduced satellites in intensity if the recycle time used was too short \({}^{2}\)b,6.However, unambiguous evidence was afforded for the connectivity between C-8/C-9 and C-9/C-11 by the detection of the two-bond coupling constant J8,11 (Table).Such coupling constants (\({}^{2}\)JCC) through a ketone have been shown to be of the order of 9 - 12 Hz in cyclohexanone systems 6. The ID-INADEQUATE spectral analysis of terpenic molecules at high magnetic field is often very difficult.Complications are due to the similarity of most coupling constants and to the rather important isotope shifts.Furthermore, the coupling carbon pairs display AX or only weak AB systems.

In order to establish the complete connectivity of the molecular framework of velloziolone and to confirm the ID-n.m.r. results, a two-dimensional study was undertaken on (1) as described by Freeman \({}^{1}\)b.The two-dimensional spectrum was recorded on the sample used in the 1D-INADEQUATE experiment, at 60degC in order to shorten spin-lattice relaxation times.The data,

ppm in CDC13) 7.Chemical shifts of C-5, C-8 and C-13 are in agreement 7 with the stereochemistry shown which is the same in previously isolated related compounds 2a.

The digital resolution in this 2D-study was insufficient to determine precise coupling constants.The latter (Table and Figure) result from the ID-INADEQUATE experiment described above.It is worth noting that the low values of the coupling constants (Table) corresponding to J8,14 and J11,12 reflect the \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) position of these linkages with respect to the C-9 ketone.Such an effect has been demonstrated previously on cyclohexanone systems 6.

This investigation illustrates the advantages of high magnetic field for structural studies based on natural abundance 13C - 13C coupling constants.The study could be completed in spite of the unfavourable dispersion of the carbon signals, five of which appear in (1) within 1.46 ppm in the 42 - 44 ppm region.
