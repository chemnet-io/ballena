###### Abstract

Five tetrahydrofuran lignans and two known flavones were isolated from the aerial parts of _Peperonia blanda_. The structures of the isolated lignans were elucidated by interpretation of their spectroscopic data, including by gHMQC and gHMBC. The relative and absolute configurations of the isolates were determined from NOESY interactions and optical properties, respectively. Four of the lignans were diastereomeric whilst one was of mixed biosynthetic origin. All but one of the lignans exhibited high _in vitro_ trypanocidal activity when assayed against epimastigotes of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ strain Y.

## 1 Introduction

Chagas disease is one of the most widespread of tropical diseases, being endemic in 21 countries, with some 16-18 million individuals infected and a further 100 million people at risk (Molfetta et al., 2005; Pozas et al., 2005).

Significant antiprotozoan activities have recently been reported for a number of lignans derived from members of the Piperaceae family (Martins et al., 2003; Luize et al., 2006). This family, which is included among the basal angiosperms and can be found in the tropics mainly as pioneer plants, has been the subject of numerous phytochemical investigations. The major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Parmar et al., 1997; Benevides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Alecio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (Moreira et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005).

_Piper_ and _Peperonia_ represent the most important genera of the Piperaceae family with 2000 (Wanke et al., 2006) and 1700 species (Quijano-Abril et al., 2006), respectively. Species of _Peperonia_ are well known as ornamental plants and have found application in folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, asthma and gastric ulcers, and as analgesic and antibacterial agents (Arrigon-Blank et al., 2004). The major classes of compounds present in the relatively few species of _Peperonia_ that have been investigated are prenylated phenols and benzoic acids (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Seeram et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998; Salazar et al., 2005), and also dibenzylbutarolactone and dibenzylbutanediol lignans (Li et al., 2006).

Additionally, several lignans (Li et al., 2007) and unusual seco- and nor-lignans have also been described (Bayma et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006). More recently, two new tetrahydrofuran lignans were isolated from _Peperomia pellucida_ (Xu et al., 2006) and thus a phenylprognoid-based lineage for the _Peperomia_ species can be supported.

_Peperomia blanda_ H.B. & K. is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet rock crevices (Guimaraes and Giordano, 2004). At the present time, information is only available concerning the essential oil (Santos et al., 2001) and two chromenes isolated from the non-polar fraction of the aerial parts of the species (Velozo et al., 2006). In the present work, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of four new tetrahydrofuran lignan stereoisomers and a new tetrahydrofuran lignan of mixed biosynthetic origin. The antitripanosomal properties of these novel lignans have been determined.

## Results and discussion

The EtOAc extract derived from aerial parts of _P. blanda_ was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 was fractionated chromatography to yield five lignans **1-5**; (Fig. 1) and two flavones (**6** and **7**). The 1H NMR spectra of compounds **1-4** were characteristic of non-symmetric tetrahydrofuran lignans since each exhibited a pair of doublets at \(d\) 0.63 +- 0.05 (CH3-9) and 1.04 +- 0.04 (CH3-9') corresponding to methyl groups, a second set of doublets at \(d\) 5.03 +- 0.02 (H-7) and 4.32 +- 0.03 (H-7') that were assignable to oxybenzyl methine groups, and multiplets at \(d\) 2.18 +- 0.03 and 1.69 +- 0.03 associated, respectively, with the H8 and H8' protons. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data corroborated the presence of the tetrahydrofuran system in each case, and all signals were assigned accordingly based on HMBC data (Tables 1 and 2).

As previously reported (Biftu and Stevenson, 1987; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989), the coupling constants of 8.5 and 9.0 Hz for the doublet at \(d\) 5.05, and of 4.33 Hz for H-7 and H-7' indicate that these hydrogens are in a _trans_ configuration with the adjacent H-8 and H-8' in a tetrahydrofuran ring. Differential NOE experiments (Fig. 2) confirmed the relative stereochemistry of all of the lignans isolated. Thus, as for lignan 3, H-7 showed clear NOE correlations with H-7' and H-8, H-7' correlated with H-7, H-8 and H-9', and H-8' correlated with H-9 confirming the _trans_ configuration of the adjacent H-8 and H-8' and a _cis_ configuration between H-7 and H-7'.

The differences observed in the NMR spectra of compounds **1-4** were due to different substitution patterns in the aromatic ring. The molecular formula of lignan 1 was established as C22H26O7 by HRMS. The aromatic moieties were determined to be syringyl and 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups on the following basis: (i) two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at \(d\) 6.49 (_s_, 2H) correlated to H7 in the HMBC spectrum, (ii) aromatic carbons C3 and C5 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.80) and to H2/H6, and (iii) the second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at \(d\) 6.61 (H2') and 6.64 (H6'), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-4' and C-7' in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, **1** was established as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S-4-hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,5,3'-trimethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan_.

Compound **2** showed a molecular formula of C23H28O7 by HRMS. 1H NMR spectra indicated two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at \(d\) 6.48 (_s_, 2H) correlating to H7 in the HMBC spectrum and aromatic carbons C3, C5 at \(d\) 152.8 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.77) and to H2/H6 and subsequently, C4 at \(d\) 136.6 displayed correlations to OCH3 (_d_ 3.76). The second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at \(d\) 6.61 (H2') and 6.64 (H6'), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-4' and C-7' in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, **2** was identified as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S)-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,3'-tetramethylenedioxy-7,7'-epoxylignan, i.e., a methylated derivative of **1**.

The molecular formula of **3** was determined to be C23H30O7 by HRMS, and the aromatic moieties were identified as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylophenyl groups. The aromatic singlets at \(d\) 6.49 and 6.67 were assigned to separate aromatic groups, since the HMBC showed correlation to H7 (_d_ 5.03) and H7' (_d_ 4.34), respectively. The remaining correlations between C3/C3', C4/C4' and C5/C5' perfectly matched those of H2/H2'and H6/H6'. Thus compound **3** was determined as _rel-(7R,8S,7'S,8'S/S)-4'-hydroxy-3,4,5,3',5'-pentamethoxy-7,7'-epoxylignan_.

Compound **4** showed the molecular formula C22H24O7 by HRMS, and both aromatic moieties were identified as 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups for the signals at \(d\) 5.97 (_s_, 2H) and \(d\) 5.96 (_s_, 2H) due to methylenedioxyphenyl groups connected to C4/C5 and C4'/C5', respectively. At \(d\) 3.93 (_s_, 3H) and \(d\) 3.90 (_s_, 3H) are the resonances of two methoxyl groups correlated to C3 and C3'.

The identity of **4** was thus established as _rel_-(7\(R\),8\(S\),7_'S_,8_'S_)-4,5_,4_'_,5_'_-dimethylenedioxy-3,3'_-dimethoxy-7,7'_-_-_epoxysilignan.

The molecular formula of **5** was established as C23H28O8 by HRMS. The compound differed from lignans **1-4** in respect to a hydroxyl group linked to C-9. The presence of this group was deduced from various sources: the IR spectrum (absorption at 3450 cm-1), from the 1H NMR by signals at \(d\) 3.40 (2H, m), from the 13C NMR both from resonances at \(d\) 62.5 and the presence of only one methyl group (_d_ 1.08; \(d\), \(J\) = 7.0 Hz), and from the HMBC, which showed connectivity between the H9 protons and C7. Thus, **5** was determined as _rel_-(7\(R\),8\(S\),7_'S_,8_'S_)-9-hydroxy-4',5'-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,3'-tetramethoxy-7,7'-

epoxylignan.

The known flavones 5-hydroxy-4',7,8-trimethoxyflavone (**6**) and 5-hydroxy-3',4',7,8-tetramethylaxone (**7**) were also identified in the extract derived from the aerial parts of _P. blanda_. These compounds have been previously isolated from _Peperomia sui_ (Cheng et al., 2003).

Compounds **1-5** were submitted to bioassay against epimastigotes of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ strain Y and the respective IC50 values are shown in Table 3. All of the lignans exhibited potent trypanocidal activity. Compound **4**, bearing two methylenedioxyphenyl groups, was more

active than other lignans possessing one or no methylenedioxyphenyl group.

### Concluding remarks

In this work, we describe the isolation and structural elucidation of five new tetrahydrofuran lignans from the aerial part of _P. blanda_. The trypanocidal activity of these compounds was evaluated against epimastigotes of _T. cruzi_ strain Y. All of the isolates showed potent activity when compared with the positive control benzidazole.

## Experimental

### General

\({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HREIMS were measured using a Bruker Daltronics model ultraTOFo ESI-TOF instrument. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar model SD-1 LC/UV/VIS chromatograph equipped with a Supelcosil C-18 reversed phase column (250 x 21.2 mm; Supelco). IR spectra were measured in KBr pellets in a Perkin-Elmer Infrared spectrometer FTIR series 1600. Optical rotations were measured at \(\lambda = 589\) nm in a digital polarimeter JASCO model DIP-370. UV spectra were recorded in MeOH using a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer. Separations by CC were carried out using silica gel (230-400 mesh; Merck). All solvents were redistilled prior to use.

### Plant material

The aerial parts of _P. blanda_ were collected at the Reserva da Ripasa, Ibate - SP, Brazil in January of 2005 and identified by Dra. Elsie Franklin Guimaraes. A voucher specimen (Kato-547) has been deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Biociencias, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo - SP, Brazil.

### Isolation of compounds

Dried aerial parts (86 g) of _P. blanda_ were milled, extracted with EtOAc (1.2 L) for 4 hours at room temperature, and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude extract (8.5 g). This extract was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 (1.95 g) was submitted to CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc to yield fractions 1-14. The precipitate present in fraction 3 (420 mg) was purified by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound **6** (6.3 mg), whilst the soluble part was submitted to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc producing subfractions 3-1 to 3-60. Subfractions 3-20 (12 mg) and 3-43 (46 mg) afforded compounds **4** and **2**, respectively. Fraction 4 (220 mg) was submitted to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc providing subfractions 4-1 to 4-37. Subfraction 4-23 (98 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (72:28) to afford compound **1** (8.6 mg). The precipitate present in fraction 6 (103 mg) was purified by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound **7** (8.0 mg). Fraction 7 (350 mg) was subjected to flash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc resulting in subfractions 7-1 to 7-167. Subfraction 7-140 afforded compound **5** (7 mg). Subfraction 7-79 (95.0 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (2:3) to yield five fractions, the penultimate of which afforded compound **3** (17 mg).

### 3.9. In vitro bioassays

The biological assays with epimastigote forms of _T. cruzi_ strain Y were performed as described previously (Bernacchi et al., 2002). Tetrahydrofuran lignans and benzmidazole (Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were stored as 1.0 mg ml\({}^{-1}\) stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and were serially diluted (1:3) prior to use with liver-infusion tryptose (LIT) medium to provide concentrations of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg ml\({}^{-1}\), each in triplicate. The number of viable protozoa was determined by counting in a Neubauer chamber after 72 h incubation at 28 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC\({}_{50}\)) values were calculated by fitting a nonlinear regression curve (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) and comparing with those of benzmidazole, the positive control. A one-way ANOVA test was used to establish the significance level of the activity corresponding to each compound evaluated in the _in vitro_ assay.
