# Abstract

The flowers of Cassia spectabilis yielded three new piperidine alkaloids, (-)-3-O-acetylspectaline (1), (-)-7-hydroxypedaline (2), and iso-6-spectaline (3), together with the known (-)-spectaline (4). The green fruits of this plant were also investigated, resulting in the isolation of 1 and 4. Their structure was elucidated using a combination of multidimensional NMR and MS techniques, and relative stereochemistries were established by NOESY correlations and analysis of coupling constants. The DNA-damaging activity of these compounds was evaluated using a mutant yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, assay.

Compound 2 was obtained as colorless oil, with a molecular formula at C20H3SnO3 indicated by the molecular ion peak at m/z 342.3072 in its HRESIIMS. The IR absorption bands for a secondary amine (3340, 1550 cm-1), ketone function (1725 cm-1), and a strong peak for a hydroxyl group (3450 cm-1) were similar to those of 4.9 Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data of 2 with those of 4 suggested that compound 2 was very similar to 4 except for the data related to the piperidine ring. The 13C data of 2 showed the same resonances observed for 4 with the exception of the values for C-2 (61.1), C-3 (66.2), C-6 (56.9), and C-7 (64.7), indicating that the C-7 methyl group in 2 is a hydroxymethylene group. The significant shielding observed for C-3 (66.2) when compared to 4 could be explained by the \(\gamma\)-effect of the C-7 hydroxymethylene (Figure 2, Supporting information). With this molecular feature, the OH group at C-3 prefers the axial orientation, permitting an intramolecular H-bond between the hydroxyl at C-7 and the lone pair of electrons on N.4,13 These findings were further supported by 1H NMR spectra, which showed signals at 0 3.66 (1H, dd, J = 6.5, 11.0 Hz) and 3.74 (1H, dd, J = 4.5, 11.0 Hz) attributable to hydrogens at C-7. The structure of 2 was also strongly supported by HMRC (Figure 1, Supporting Information), 1H - 1H COSY, and TOCSY correlations. The stereocenters C-2, C-3, and C-6 in 2 were also assigned as R, R, and S, respectively, by a combination of NMR spectroscopy, molecular modeling, and a comparative analysis based on the known configuration of 4.

Alkaloid 3 was assigned the molecular formula C20H4a-NO2 on the basis of the HRESIIMS. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data, however, were quite different from those observed for 4, mainly the data related to the piperidine ring. Detailed analysis of 1H and 13C chemical shift values closely matched those of iso-6-Caravaline5 and leptophylline.8,9 except for the values attributed to the long chain, which was similar to those found for 4. By NOESY spectra, no correlation was observed between H-2 and H-6, as expected due to the changing of configuration at C-6 (Figure 2, Supporting Information). Additionally, interrelation of COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra confirmed that 4 was iso-6-specaline.

Biological activity data for alkaloids 1-4 were obtained using mechanism-based yeast mutant bioassays14 and are summarized in Table 1. These data show that besides (-)-specaline (4),9 already reported to exhibit some effect on DNA, only alkalaloid 1 showed activity, which was comparable to that observed for 4.

### Experimental Section

General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 degC. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725xF T spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125.67 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using ESI mode and MeOH/H2O (1:1) as solvent (one voltage 30 V). Al2O3 grade 1, type WN-3 was used for column chromatography, TLC, and preparative TLC; visualization of TLC plates was made by spraying with iodochloroplatinate reagent (Merck) and Dragondorf's reagent.

Plant Material. The flowers and fruits of C. specidulis were collected in May and December 1999 from a specimen cultivated at the Botanical Garden of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen (SILVA-193) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden.

Bioassays. Identical to those reported earlier.14

Extraction and Isolation. The ethanolic extract of the flowers was concentrated, redissolved in MeOH/H2O (8:2), and partitioned successively with hexanes, CH2Cl2, EtOHac, and n-BOH. The CH2Cl2-soluble fraction was concentrated, yielding 39 g of crude material. This was redissolved in 100 mL of CH2Cl2 and extracted with aqueous 40% HCl (3 x 50 mL); the combined aqueous fractions were adjusted to pH 9 using concentrated NH2OH. The resulting aqueous basic solution was exhaustively extracted with CH2Cl2, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated, furnishing 9 g of a crude alkaloid fraction. The crude alkaloid portion was further chromatgraphed on a neutral Al2O3 column with a gradient mixture of EtOH/CHCl3/hexanes as eluent, affording piperidine alkaloids (-)-specaline (4) (4.82 g) and 1 (151 mg) and a complex alkaloid mixture. Further purification of this mixture on preparative TLC, using CH2Cl2/_n_-hexaneEtOH (6.5:3:0.0:5) as eluent, afford (-)-7-hydroxycysteine (2) (5.5 mg) and iso-6-specaline (3) (20 mg).

The fruit extract was partitioned successively with hexanes, CH2Cl2, EtOHac, and n-BOH. The CH2Cl2 fraction obtained from the partition procedures was extracted with aqueous 40% HCl (3 x 50 mL) and then adjusted to pH 9 with NH2OH. The aqueous basic solution was exhaustively extracted with CH2Cl2 as indicated above for the isolation of alkaloids from flowers. Purification of this alkaloid mixture by preparative TLC afforded 4 (3.0 mg) and 1 (4.2 mg) as the major constituents.
