### X-ray crystal structure analysis of 1

A colourless plate single crystal (0.50 x 0.33 x 0.07 mm) of **1** (C20H3O4) was mounted on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation and -2 scan-technique. The unit cell and the orientation matrix for the data collection were obtained by a least-squares fit of 25 centered reflections (8.69 < 14.1o). The intensities of three standard reflections were measured every 60 min and varied about 1.0% throughout the experiment. The intensity data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects, but not absorption corrections [a(Mo-K = 0.080 mm-1]. The number of measured reflections was 4930 in the range -10" h" 10, -9"k" 12, 0" l" 46, with 3530 unique reflections, and 2529 with the condition I '2 (I) were considered observed. Equivalent reflections were merged with Rint = 3.27%. Crystal data: orthorhombic, P212121 (no.19), \(a\) = 8.833 (2), \(b\) = 10.749(2), \(c\) = 39.837(8) Ao, Z = 8, with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by means of direct methods using SHELXS97 computer program4 and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 with SHELXL97 computer program5. H atoms were placed geometrically except those on the hydroxyl groups. The final refinement gave R (on F) factor of 0.055, wR (on F2) = 0.152 for 446 refined parameters.

## Results and Discussion

Jatrowediol **(1)** was obtained from the dichloromethane extract of the stems of _J. weddelliana_ as a dextrorotatory powder. The molecular formula C20H30O4 was deduced from the NMR data and the molecular ion ([M+1] at _m/z_ 335) from the Electron Spray Mass Spectrum. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of carbonyl (1716 cm-1) and hydroxyl groups (3495 cm-1). The UV spectrum in CHCl3 afforded a max at 239.5 nm (-C=C-C-O). The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra presented twenty carbon signals, including characteristic signals due to a trisubstituted double bond ( C154.3 and 140.4), two carbonyls ( C210.5 and 213.3), two carbonyls hydroxyls ( C71.5 and 85.9), five methyls, four methylenes, four methines and a quaternary carbon. Triplets at H 0.34 (t, 1H) and 0.79 (lt, 1H) in the 1H NMR spectrum suggested the presence of a cyclopropane moiety in the molecule. The unambiguous assignment of the protonated carbons was obtained by the HETCOR measurements (Table 1) and decoupling experiments, while that of quaternary carbons came from the long-range HETCOR spectrum and selective INEPT experiments (Table 2). Together, the above data suggested a lathyrane gross structure for **1**.

The relative stereochemistry of methyl groups and of carbons C-6 to C-15 was confirmed by a series of difference NOE experiments (Table 3). However, the stereochemistry of cyclopentanone ring junction with the macrocycle could not be confirmed. The signal at H 8.0 could not be unambiguously assigned as refering to the hydroxyl on C-15 or on C-6 or both. The absolute configuration of **1** was determined by single a crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 1). The two independent molecules of the asymmetric unit have the same absolute configuration.

Compounds **2-8**2-3 were also isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the stems and identified by 2D NMR experiments. In particular, some assignments of the carbon signals for compounds **3** and **5** have been revised.
