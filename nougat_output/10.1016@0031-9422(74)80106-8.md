###### Abstract

A re-examination of the heartwood of _Goniorhachis marginata_ disclosed the presence of additional peltogynoids: mopanone and peltochalcone.

## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation procedure._ The mother liquor of mopachalcone (**4a**) (_ex_ fraction F1, see Experimental, Ref. 2) was chromatographed on silica. CHCl3- MeOH 97:3 eluted a fraction which, upon slow evaporation of the solvent, gave crystals of **3a** (55 mg). Impure fractions and mother liquors of F2, F3 and F42 were chromatographed on silica. The eluate obtained with CHCl3-MeOH (24:1) was evaporated. The residue was washed with MeOH and recrystallized from MeOH giving 2b (95 mg).

_Mopanone_ (2b). m.p. 255-260deg (MeOH) (Found: C, 63:80; H, 40:1. Calc. for C10H12Ou: C, 64:00; H, 403deg0deg0), \(\lambda_{\max}^{\text{EHOH}}\) (nm): 240 inf.

_Trimethylether_ (3b). Treatment of 3a with Me2SO4-K2CO3-Me2CO (reflux, 1 hr), and purification of the reaction product by TLC, gave yellow crystals, m.p. 126\({}^{\circ}\) (MeOH). \(\nu_{\rm max}^{\rm BK}\) (cm\({}^{-1}\)): 2600 (broad), 1620, 1610, 1587, 1555, 1520, 1500. Direct comparison proved this compound to be identical with an authentic sample prepared from 1d, the trimethyl ether of natural peltogynone (1b),2 by the technique of flavanone-chalcone conversion described.2

_Terramethyl ether_ (3c). Exhaustive methylation of 3b by Me2SO4-K2CO3-Me2CO, and purificaton of the reaction product by TLC, gave yellow needles, m.p. 135-138 (MeOH). \(\nu_{\rm max}^{\rm BK}\) (cm\({}^{-1}\)): 1647, 1600, 1575, 1510, 1470, 1385, 1335, 1320, 1260, 1210, 1120, 1110, 1025.
