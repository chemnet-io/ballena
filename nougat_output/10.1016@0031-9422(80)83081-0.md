# Neolignans from Aniba Ferrea*

Carlos H. S. Andrade, Raimundo Braz Filho, Otto R. Gottlieb

# Abstract

The trunk wood of the Amazonian _Aniba ferra_ Kubitzki contains, besides three benzyl benzoates (\(\mathbf{1a,b,c}\)) and dillapiol (\(\mathbf{2}\)), four hydrogenofuranoid and two bicyclo [3.2.1] octanoid neolignans. The former comprise two representatives (\(\mathbf{3a,b}\)) of the novel ferrearin- (3a-ally-2-aryl-7a-hydroxy-3-methyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-7-oxobenzofuran) type, and two further representatives (\(\mathbf{4a,b}\)) of the known porosin- (3a-ally)-2-aryl-5-methoxy-3a,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran) type. The latter comprises a new representative (\(\mathbf{5a}\)) of the known canali- (1-ally-6-aryl-7-methylbicyclo [3.2.1] octane) type, and the methyl ether (\(\mathbf{6a}\)) of a known guianin- (1-ally-6-aryl-7-methyl-4-oxobicyclo [3.2.1] oct-2-en) type neolignan.

## Introduction

_Aniba ferrea_ Kubitzki, a Lauraceous tree popularly known as 'louro ferro', occurs in the vicinity of Manaus, Amazonas. Its heartwood gave besides three benzyl benzoates (\(\mathbf{1a,b,c}\)), the simple allylylbenzene dilapiol (\(\mathbf{2}\)) and six new neolignans belonging to the novel ferrearin type (\(\mathbf{3a,b}\)), the porosin [2] type (\(\mathbf{4a,b}\)), the cancellin [3] type (\(\mathbf{5a}\)) and the guianin [4] type (\(\mathbf{6a}\)). For reasons stated in a previous paper of this series [5], nomenclature and numbering of neolignans follow the rules outlined in a recent review [6].

## Results and discussion

Dillapiol (\(\mathbf{2}\)) [3] and benzyl salicylate (\(\mathbf{1a}\)) [7] were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples. Benzyl 2-methoxybenzoate (\(\mathbf{1b}\)) and benzyl 2,6-dimethoxybenzoate (\(\mathbf{1c}\)) were characterized spectroscopically as components of a mixture. The identification was confirmed by hydrolysis, which, as expected,

proceeded at a faster rate for **1b** than for **1c**, and separation of the corresponding acids and alcohol.

Analysis of the NMR spectrum of ferrearin-A (**3a**), C20H22O6, suggested its classification as a neolignan of partial constitution **7**. This was confirmed by the complete series of 1H NMR double irradiation experiments which established the sequence CHCHMe; by MS which shows peaks at _m_/_e_ 192 (33%) (**8**) and 181 (45%); and 13C NMR data which are close (cf. D_d_-values shown in **7**) to the data reported for the naturally occurring neolignan **9**[8]. The sole significant differential value refers to C-7, more highly deshielded in **9** due to electronic delocalization towards the carbonyl.

The yet undefined C9H10O2 moiety contains the sequences CH2CH=CH2 and CH2CH=CHCO (_n_max 1680 cm-1) again established by a complete series of 1H NMR double irradiation experiments. Both sequences are linked to unprotonated positions. 13C NMR not only confirms these assignments, but gives additional evidence of two fully substituted carbons; one linked only to C (_d_ \(d\) 52.5) and the other linked also to O (_d_ _99.7), i.e. to the non-acylatable hydroxyl causing a 1H NMR singlet at \(d\) 4.7 which disappears upon addition of D2O.

Among the alternative partial constitutions **10** and **11** compatible with these data, **11** was selected. Indeed, the C-1' resonance (_d_ 52.5) in **3a** occurs only 2 ppm downshell from the resonance of the analogous carbon in porosin (**4e**) [8]. Introductions of an _a_-oxo group as in **10** would be expected to result in a much stronger effect (cf. data for **12** and **13**[9]). In another independent comparison with a model, virtual coincidence of the chemical shifts of the allylic ring carbons in **11** and carvone (**14**) [10] is incompatible with the existence of a vicinal oxygenated C as in **10**.

Joining of the partial constitutions **7** and **11** must take into consideration the existence of only two carbons with oxy-substituents (_d_ 81.8, 99.7) and thus leads to the constitution **3a**. One of the mentioned carbons must thus be part of a hemiketal, as corroborated by 13C NMR evidence (cf. chemical shifts for hemiketal carbons of **3a** vs the model compound **15**[11], \(d\) 99.7 vs 102.2). Hemiketals are easily cleaved by acid, and, indeed, treatment of the compound with TsOH in dry MeOH at room temperature leads to the ketals **16** and **17**, as well as to the Cope rearrangement product **18**.

With respect to stereochemistry, a _cis_ Ar/Me relation is indicated by the high field Cb3-resonance (d 0.76). This fact, together with the _trans_ Me/allyl relation is also evidenced by the near identity of selected chemical shifts (see above) of **7** (incorporated in **3a**) and **9** (chiefly for C-9, d respectively 10.8 and 11.9). A better model for the comparison of the chemical shift value for C-7 of **3a** is, of course, **4c** (d respectively 40.4 and 39.0). The closeness of these values also reflects the absence of a g-effect on C-7' which would be contributed by a cis-hydroxyl at C-2'. The _trans_-_cis_ Ar/Me/allyl arrangement, which is more common among neolignans of the burchellin type **9** requires the C-9 and C-7' resonances at d 8.5 and 36.7 [8].

Comparison of IR, 1H NMR (Table 1) and MS of ferrarin-A (**3a**) and ferrarin-B (**3b**) shows all significant differences to be due solely to the absence of the methoxyl in the latter. Its constitution and stereochemistry may thus be formulated as shown.

The structural proposals for the neoligans of the porosin-type **4a** and **4b**, and of the canellin-type **5a** relied on UV, NMR (Table 1) and MS comparisons with the compounds **4c** [2] and **5b** [3]. All proton sequences in the new compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR double resonance experiments. Compound **6a** had already been obtained previously by Me2SO4-methylation of the naturally occurring **6b** [12] and was identified by direct comparison with an authentic sample. This comparison did not include ORD curves, and thus the configurations indicated in the formula **6a** and, for that matter, in all other formulae of the present report, are only relative.

The ferrearrains (**3a**, **b**) lack oxygenation at C-4'. Not considering neolignan types whose genesis seems to involve allyl rearrangement [6], only the recently reported cytotoxic meagphones [13] share this biosynthetically interesting feature.

## Experimental

### Isolation of constituents.

A sample of trunk wood of _Aniba ferrea_ Kubitzki (voucher herbarium INPA, Manaus, 21226) from the vicinity of Manaus, Amazonas, was reduced to powder (5 kg) and percolated with C6H6. The extract (80 g) was adsorbed on Si gel and the powder washed with C6H6. Evaporation of the solvent gave an oily residue (19 g) which was chromatographed on Si gel (360 g). Elution with petrol-C6H6(1:1), C6H6-CHCl3(1:1), CHCl3 and CHCl3-MeOH (99:1) i gave 4 fractions which were separated by Si gel TLC with the indicated developers into **3a**, **3b**, **1b** + **1e**, and **1a** (1st fraction, C6H6-CHCl3, 3:1), **4a** (2nd fraction, CHCl3-Et2O, 4:1), **5a** (3rd fraction, C6H6-CHCl3, 3:2), **6a** and **4b** (4th fraction, C6H6-EtOHC6-CHCl3, 3:2).
