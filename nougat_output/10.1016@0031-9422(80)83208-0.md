**Key Word Index--_Aniba_ sp.: Lauraceae; bicyclo[3.2.1]octanoid neoligans; hydrobenzofuranoid neoligans.

## INTRODUCTION

The trunk wood of an _Aniba_ (Lauraceae) species collected 130 km north of Manaus (Amazonas) contained, besides elemicin (3,4,5-trimethoxysallylbenzene), three burchellin-type neoligans (**1a**, **1b**, **2**) previously isolated from **A**. _terminalis_[2, 3] and five novel neoligans, four of the cancellin type (**3a**, **3b**, **3f**, **4b**) and one of the guainain type (**4a**). For reasons stated in the previous paper in this series [1], nomenclature and numbering of neoligans follow the rules which were outlined in a recent review [4].

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

\({}^{1}\)H NMR analysis showed **3a**, C18H18O(OH)2O2-CH2, **3b**, C18H18O*

## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation of the constituents._ Trunk wood of an _Aniba_ species (voucher Herbarium INPA, Manaus, 43254), collected near km 133 of the Manaus-Ilacoatiara highway (Amazonas) was reduced to powder (4.5 kg) and percolated with EtOH. The solvent was evapd and the residue (65 g) extracted with C6H6. The extract (5 g) was chromatographed on a dry Si gel (280 g) column. Development with C6H6-EtOCA (8:2) gave 6 fractions. Fraction 1 (0.9 g) was a fatty oil. Fraction 2 (0.7 g) gave elemicin. Fraction 3 (0.9 g) was separated with MeOH into an insoluble steroid and a soluble mixture. This was separated by TLC (Si gel; petrol-Mc2CO, 8:2) into **1a** and 3e. Fractions 4 (0.3 g) and 5 (0.3 g) were separated by the same TLC procedure respectively into **4a** + **4a**, **3a**, **2** and **1b**, **3h**. All products were purified by TLC (Si gel; C6H6-EtO7, 7:3) giving **1a** (8 mg), **1b** (159 mg), **2** (20 mg), **3a** (49 mg), **3b** (13 mg), **3c** (12 mg, **4a** (8 mg), **4b** (5 mg).Identifications of the known compounds elemicin, **1a**, **1b** and **2** involved direct comparison with authentic samples [2, 3].
