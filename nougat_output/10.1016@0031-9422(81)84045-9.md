# LIGNANS AND NEOLIGNANS FROM

_Licaria Armeniaca_

# Abstract

A re-examination of the trunk wood of _Licaria Armeniaca_ led to the isolation of 6,7-dimethoxyoumarin, 1,2,3-trimethoxy-7-oxoaporphine (tri-_O_-methylmoschatoline), 2e-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-6e-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo [3.3.0] octan (magnolin) and a novel neolignan (7S,8R,1'S,2'S,3'S)-2'-acetoxy-1'-allyl-3',5'-dimethoxy-8-methyl-7-piperonyl-bicyclo [3.2.1]-oct-5'-en-4'-one.

## Introduction

A previous study of the trunk wood of the Amazonian Lauraceae species _Licaria Armeniaca_ (Nees) Kosterm. revealed the presence of 6,7-dimethoxyoumarin and of two proosin-type neoligans [2]. The species is rather widespread and seemingly prone to chemical variation. Indeed, the study of another specimen indicated 6,7-dimethoxyoumarin and the oxoaporphine tri-_O_-methylmoschatoline [3] to be accompanied by the fourfuran lignan magnolin [4] and a novel neolignan. For reasons stated in a previous paper of this series [5], nomenclature and numbering of neoligans follow the rules outlined in a recent review [6].

## Results and discussion

The neolignan, C23H28O7 by C and H NMR counts associated with a mass spectrometric molecular weight determination, was assigned structure **1a** upon comparison with **1b** [6] and **2** [7] by IR, 1H NMR (Table 1), 13C NMR (Table 2) and ORD (Table 3) data. Indeed the H-9 (d 0.92 +- 0.02) and H-6' (d 5.65 +- 0.05) signals of **1a** and **1b** are similar and differ significantly from the H-9 (d 1.23) and H-6' (d 6.10) signals of **2.** As expected, the 13C NMR signals for C-9 (d 13.9) and C-6' (d 124.1) of **1a** (_endo_-Me-8) occur at a higher field than the signals for C-9 (d 17.4) and C-6' (d 126.8) of **2** (_ex_o_-Me-8), in view of the reciprocal _g_-effects felt by these carbons in the former compound.

The significant spectral differences between **1a** and **1b** are due to the existence of piperonyl and acetyl in **1a** vs 3-methoxypiperonyl and hydroxyl in **1b**. This was confirmed respectively by MS, which cleaves **1a** into the typical [CH2O2. C6H1. CH=CH. Mc]-1 fragment of the piperonyl-substituted neoligans, and by hydrolysis of **1a** into **1c**, which is accompanied by a 1.37 ppm diamagnetic shift of the H-2' signal to d 4.00, the chemical shift value shown by H-2' in **1b** (Table 1). The epimeric alcohol **3** is a by-product in this reaction. The 13C NMR spectra of the

epimeric alcohols. Association with pyridine causes consistently stronger shifts of the aromatic proton signals pertaining to 1c than those pertaining to 3. Most conspicuously, the CH2O2 band, split into two doublets in the case of 1c, remains a singlet in the case of 3.

## EXPERIMENTAL

### Isolation of constituents

Trunk wood of a specimen (voucher herbarium INPA, Manaus, 47251), identified by Dr. W. A.

Rodrigues, was collected at Igarape de Piau, Rio Castanho, near Manaus, Amazonas State. The powdered wood (5kg) was percolated successively with C6H4 and EtOH. The solvents were evapd and the residues submitted chronatographic fractionation employing solvent (C6H4, C6H3, EtOHAc, MeOH) mixtures of gradually increasing polarity. The C6H4 extract (16 g on 480 g Si gel) gave, in order, sistosterol (1g), 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin (30 mg), 1a (130 mg) and a mixture. Purification of the mixture by prep. TLC (Si gel, C6H4-Me2CO, 4:1) gave tri-O-methylconschatone (16 mg). The EtOH extract (10g on 350 g Si gel) gave, in order, sistosterol (0.3 g), tri-O-methylconschatone (82 g) and magnolin (14 mg).

### Identifications

Sitosterol, 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin [2] and tri-O-methylconschatoline [3] were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples. Magnolin was identified by comparison of 1H NMR and MS with the analogous data reported in the lit. [4].

### Hydrolysis

A son of 1a in 5% NaOH (H2O-MeOH, 5 ml) was maintained under reflux (2 hr). H2O was then added gradually to maintain a constant vol., while the MeOH was removed by distillation. The mixture was cooled to room temp., acidified with 10% HCl and extracted with CHCl3. The CHCl3 soln was washed, dried and evapd. The residue was separated by Si gel column chromatography into 1e (63 mg) and 3 (17 mg). 1c, oil, MS m/z (rel. int.): 372 (29) M*', 210 (8), 195 (6), 194 (18), 182 (14), 181 (100), 179 (5), 169 (45), 167 (11), 163 (4), 162 (12), 151 (14), 150 (9), 149 (36), 3, oil, MS m/z (rel. int.): 372 (56) M*', 331 (17), 210 (26), 195 (9), 189 (14), 187 (47), 169 (100), 167 (10), 163 (30), 162 (16), 150 (16), 149 (37), 135 (44).

Acetylation of 1e (Ac2O, C5H3N, room temp., 24 hr), followed by the usual work-up gave a product shown to be identical with 1a by TLC (Si gel) and 1H NMR spectroscopy.
