_(Revised received 26 January 1981)_Vismia cayennensis_ (Jacq.) Pers. [1] and _V. japurensis_ Reich. (Guttiferae) [2] are large shrubs which occur in north-eastern South America. The latter species has recently been located also in central Brazil (Prof. Jose Badini, private information). Wood samples were found to contain respectively physcion (**1a**), besides sitosterol, lupeol and betulinic acid, and the two physcion derivatives **1b** and **1c**, besides sitosterol, friedelin and friedelan-3b-ol.

The structures of **1b** and **1c** resulted from a comparison of their spectral data with those of physcion (**1a**) [3]. The 1H NMR spectra were very similar with respect to the signals of H-5 (\(\delta 7.38\pm 0.04\)), H-4 (\(\delta 7.59\pm 0.04\)), H-2 (\(\delta 7.05\pm 0.03\)), Me-3 (\(\delta 2.43\pm 0.02\)), OMe-6 (\(\delta 3.98\pm 0.02\)) and two chelated hydroxyls. The only significant differences were that the signal of H-7 (\(\delta 6.68\)) in **1a**, was replaced by signals assigned to a _trans_-3-methyl-1-butenyl group in **1b** and a 3-methyl-2-oxobutyl group in **1c**. All assignments and, most importantly, the fact that the C--Me group is flanked by two aromatic protons, were confirmed by double irradiation experiments. The IR spectra were consistent with the proposed structures indicating the existence in all three compounds of chelated (\(\nu_{\max}^{\rm{chr}}\) 1623 +- 2 cm 1) and unchelated (\(\nu_{\max}^{\rm{chr}}\) 1666 +- 1 cm-1) anthraquinone carbonyls and in **1c** additionally of an unconjugated ketone function (\(\nu_{\max}^{\rm{chr}}\) 1706 cm-1).

Physcion (**1a**) is a well known natural compound and has been isolated for instance from _Harungana madagascarensis_ Poir. which also belongs to the Guttiferae family [4]. 7-(3-Methyl-1-butenyl)-physcion (**1b**) has been reported previously as one of the alkaline decomposition products of visimone A, a constituent of the berries of _Vismia baccifera_ (L.) Tr. et Pl. subsp. _dealbata_ (H.B.K.) Ewan [5]. Goncalves and Mors [6], who isolated **1b** while our work on _V. japurensis_ was in progress and who named the compound vismiaquinone, demonstrated, however, that the product is a genuine constituent of the leaves of _V. reicharditana_ (O. Ktze.) Ewan.

In addition to visimone A and vismiaquinone, only the flavones atracarpin, norartocarpin [7] and chaplashing [8] from _Artocarpus_ (Moraceae) species have been reported to contain 3-methyl-1-butenyl side chains. Delle Monache _et al._ [5] postulated that these groups may be formed from the more usual _g_-dimethyl chains by shift of the double bond into conjugation with the aromatic nucleus. The isolation of the novel vismiaquinone B (**1c**) reveals a possible mechanism for this shift. Oxygenation of the _g_-carbon of _g_-\(\gamma\)_-dimethylally groups does occur in Gutitferae, as demonstrated by psrosoperm (**2**) [9] and an analogous intermediate substituted by -CH2.CHOR.CHMe2 may be a common

precursor to both 1b and 1c.

## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation of the constituents of_ Vismia caynenensis. Plant material was collected near km 63 of the Manaus-Itacoatiara road (Amazonas State) and identified by Dr. William A. Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus. Air-dried, powdered bark (700 g) was extracted with C6H6. The extract (62 g) was chromatographed on Si gel (300 g). Elution (50 ml fractions) was performed with C6H6 (fractions 1-6), C6H6-CHCl3 mixtures (fractions 7-21), CHCl3 (fractions 22-41) and CHCl3-MeOH 5:1 (fractions 42-73). The initial fractions contained fatty material. Fractions 33-41, 42-49 and 50-65 were evapd and the residues purified, by rechromatography and crystallization from the indicated solvents, to give respectively 1a (20 mg, EtOH-CHCl3), b-amyrin (20 mg, EtOH) and sitosterol (40 mg, MeOH). Air-dried, powdered wood (5 kg) was extracted with EtOH. The extract (10 g) was chromatographed on Si gel (100 g). Elution (50 ml fraction) was performed with solvents of increasing polarity. Fractions 21-50 gave betulinic acid.

_Isolation of the constituents of_ Vismia japurensis. Plant material was collected at Serra do Caraca near Ouro Preto (Minas Gerais State) and identified by Prof. J. Badini, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (voucher Herbarium, Escola de Minas de Ouro Preto No. 1379). Air-dried, ground wood (3.4 kg) was extracted with C6H6. The extract (25 g) was chromatographed on Si gel (150 g). Elution (25 ml fractions) was performed with C6H6 (fractions 1-49), C6H6-CHCl3 1:2 (fractions 141-189) and CHCl3 (fractions 191-205). The initial fractions contained fatty material. Fractions 9-14, 31-37 and 38-49 were evapd and the residue purified, by rechromatography and crystallization from the indicated solvents, to give respectively 1b (30 mg, EtOH-CHCl3, 19:1), friedelin (25 mg, EtOH) and friedelin-3b-ol (20 mg, subl.). Fractions 141-189 were evapd. The residue was crystallized from MeOH to give sitosterol (40 mg). Fractions 191-205 were evapd. The residue was rechromatographed. A yellow fraction, crystallized from EtOH-CHCl3 (19:1), gave 1c (12 mg).
