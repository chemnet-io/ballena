# Abstract

The leaves of _Rapanea umbellata_ yielded three terpeno-_p_-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives which appear to be novel. These compounds were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-benzoic acid; 5-carboxyl-7-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-2-(1'-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhexyl-4-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and 6-carboxy-8-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-3a-hydroxy-2a-methyl-2-(4'-methylpent-3'-enyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzopyran.

## INTRODUCTION

The fruits of _Rapanea umbellata_ (Mart.) Mez. have been shown to contain 3,6-dihydroxy-2-undecyl-_p_-benzoquinone, empelin [1]. An investigation of the leaves of _R. umbellata_, a Brazilian shrub or small tree, has led to the isolation of three additional compounds which were purified as their methyl esters (1-3) and which appear to be novel.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The dichloromethane extract of the leaves yielded, on chromatography over silica gel, 3-geranyl-5-phenyl-_p_-hydroxybenzoic acid (1) and two of its derivates (2, 3). The three acids were methylated with diazomethane prior to analysis.

The most apolar compound (1), \(C_{23}\)H\({}_{23}\)O\({}_{3}\) (MS), gave rise to an IR spectrum which indicated the presence of an arylcarbomethoxy (1720 cm - 1) and a hydroxy group (3350 cm - 1). 1H NMR spectroscopy (Table 1) showed the aromatic ring to be 1,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted, with CO2Me (63.85) and hydroxyl _para_ with respect to each other. The unsubstituted C-2 and C-6 (2H, _brs_, \(d\)7.69) must be vicinal to CO2Me. The 1H NMR spectrum also showed the presence of 7,7-dimethylallyl and geranyl systems [2, 3] (61.77-1.62, 5 vinyl methyls, \(d\)5.34, 3 olefin protons and \(d\)3.29, 2 aryl substituted methylenes). The mass spectrum showed peaks which indicated C5H9 (_m/z_ 339 and 231, Scheme 1) and C10H17 (_m/z_ 231 and 271, Scheme 1) substituents, both adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl [4]. Acetylation of 1 with acetic anhydride in pyridine gave an acetate which confirmed the presence of a phenolic group. The 13C NMR chemical shifts for the 7,7-dimethylallyl and geranyl groups agreed closely with published data for these groups in 3,4-dihydroxy-5-(2-isopentenyl)-benzoic acid (4) [2] and 6-geranyl-7-hydroxy-coumarin (5) [5], respectively. The new natural product is therefore 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-benzoic acid.

Compound 2, C23H2O4, had IR absorptions similar to 1. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), in addition to signals typical of a preynelbenzoic acid methyl ester, revealed two benzylic protons (63.22 and 3.20 H-3a, \(J\) = 8.5 Hz; H-3b, \(J\) = 9.4 Hz) which coupled with one oxy-methine proton (_d_4.69, _dd_, H-2, \(J\) = 9.4, 8.5 Hz), characteristic of a 2,3-dihydro-benzofurane derivative [6, 7]. Methyl resonances at \(d\)1.67, 1.60 and 1.27, as well as signals for an olefinic proton (_d_5.10) and a hydroxyl (_d_2.59) suggested the presence of a 1'-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl side chain attached to the dihydrofuran ring on C-2. This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed fragments at _m/z_ 245 and 127 (Scheme 1) due to fission of the side chain between C-2 and C-1'. The identification of the nucleus as a dihydro-benzofuran received further support from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which showed close agreement with published data for this group in 6 [6]. Compound 2 was resistant to (Ac2O-pyridine). The mass, 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the tetrahydroderivative indicated the absence of aliphatic double bonds. The structure of the new natural product is therefore 5-carboxy-7-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-2-(1'-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.

The third compound (3) also showed the spectral characteristics of a preynbenzoic acid methyl ester. However, the mass spectrum gave significant fragments for _m/z_ 289 and 233 (Scheme 1) requiring the presence of an hydroxyl group in the dihydropyran substituent. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed resonances for C-2 to C-4 in close agreement with the resonances for the corresponding carbons in a linear 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyldihydropyrancoumarin (7) [5]. In addition, two olefinic carbon signals at \(d\)132.20 and 123.75 confirmed the presence of the 4'-methylpent-3'-enyl side chain at C-2 of the dihydropyran structure. Mass spectral fission between C-2 and C-1' afforded the ion _m/z_ 289. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), 3 showed the carboninic proton and methoxy signals at _ca_ \(d\)3.84. The secondary nature of the hydroxyl function was apparent from the

downfield shift of the methine signal to \(d\) 5.10 \(m\) (d 5.4.90-5.30 \(m\), 3H, H-2', H-3', H-3) in **3** monoacetate (**3a**). As a further confirmation of the assignments, **3** was reduced to a tetrabdry derivative (**3b**) by catalytic hydrogenation. Acetylation of the product (**3b**) with acetic anhydride in pyridine yielded **3c**, the 1H NMR of which revealed the -CH2CHOH system (_d_ 5.07, H-3, _dd_, \(J\) = 6.4, 5.6 Hz; \(d\) 3.36, H-4a, _dd_, \(J\) = 15, 5.6 Hz; \(d\) 2.95, H-4b, _dd_, \(J\) = 15, 6.4 Hz) and suggested H-3 to be in a pseudo-equatorial configuration. Addition of Eu(fod) to **3b** caused shifts in the 1H NMR spectrum which indicated complexation to occur predominantly at the hydroxyl

group. A shift of the Me-2 signal (D_d_d_ 0.72) suggested for hydroxyl and Me-2 a _cis_ relationship. Oxidation of 3**b** with PCC and subsequent reduction with sodium borohydride gave the two possible primers (d1.26, 2a-Me; d1.28, 2b-Me). Addition of Eu(fod)3 caused a shift (D_d_ 0.58) of the Me-2 signal at d1.26. The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 6-carboxy-8-(3'-3'-dimethylallyl)-3a-hydroxy-2a-methyl-2(4'-methyl-3'-methyl-3-4-dihydronezopyran.

Previous studies of the Myrsinaaceae have led to the isolation of a number of 3,6-dihydroxy-2-alkylbenzoquinones [8]. 3-Geranylated-5-prenylated-_p_-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, which are very rare in nature, have been found in one of the Myrsinaaceae species. Other _m_-_y_-,_y_-dimethylylbenzoic acid derivatives have been recorded in the Compositae [2, 6, 7]. However, 3-geranylated-5-prenylated-_p_-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives represent a novel group of terpeno-p-hydro-xybenzoic acids.
