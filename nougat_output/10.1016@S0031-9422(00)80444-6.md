for the presence of a carbonl methine signal at \(d\) _d_ 3.36 (1H, _dd_, \(J\) = 10, 5 Hz) due to a secondary hydroxyl group. The multiplucty of the signal of the CHOH proton showed that it was flanked by two hydrogens. The coupling constants were in accord with the axial orientation of the carbonlic hydrogen. Consequently, the hydroxyl group was equatorial.

The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 confirmed the proposed structure. Thus, the presence of an equatorial hydroxyl group at C-7 was ascertained from the chemical shifts of C-14 and C-6 (_d_ 47.0 and 27.7, respectively). The shielding effect on C-14 was determined by the strong _g_-_gauche_ effect of the hydroxyl group, the densihelding on C-6 being due to a _b_-effect of the same group [5] (Table 1). The positive Cotton effect for the _n_-_p_* transition in the CD spectrum of 4 (8.2 x 10-2 g/ml in MeOH [_th_] = + 4487 at 285 nm) was comparable with that observed in the case of _b_-_amyrone, establishing the _trans_ junction for ring A/B, the 8-hydroxyl group being in the _b_-orientation [6].

During the course of our work, **4** was isolated from _Bromelia pinguin_ L. (Bromeliaceae) and its structure was deduced from X-ray spectroscopy [3].

#### Group II (c)testanthane type

The two diterpenes (**5** and **6**) of this group were isolated as a mixture. The difference of two amu in the mass spectrum and two doublets at \(d\) 6.12 (_J_ = 11 Hz) and \(d\) 7.45 (_J_ = 11 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture showed that **5** and **6** differed only by the presence of a supplementary double bond in **6** which was in conjugation with a carbonyl group, as demonstrated by 13C and 1H NMR.

Catalytic reduction of the mixture (10% Pd-C, 40 psi, ethyl acetate) afforded a single substance, spectrally similar to **5**, confirming the structural pattern previously postulated for the two diterpenes. After several chromatographic trials, it was possible to obtain **5** as a pure substance, identical in all respects to the single compound previously obtained by catalytic hydrogenation. On the

other hand, in spite of exhaustive attempts, it was not possible by preparative TLC or column chromatography to isolate **6** as a pure compound, minor amounts of **5** remaining as an impurity.

The high-resolution mass spectrum of **5** indicated the molecular formula C20H26O2. The IR spectrum showed absorptions for 'normal' (1700 cm-1) and conjugated (1665 cm-1) carbonyl groups and a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring (830 cm-1). This was confirmed by the UV spectrum which exhibited absorptions at 218 (\(\log\varepsilon\) = 4.09), 255 (\(\log\varepsilon\) = 3.85) and 304 nm (\(\log\varepsilon\) = 3.08). The 1H NMR spectrum showed four C-methyl resonances (61.12, 1.25, 1.41 and 2.37), this latter signal assigned to an aromatic methyl substituent, and two doublets for two aromatic protons _ortho_ to each other at \(\delta\) 7.07 (\(J\) = 8 Hz) and \(\delta\) 7.3 (\(J\) = 8 Hz). The signals at \(\delta\) 1.25 (3H, \(J\) = 7 Hz) and the complex pattern between \(\delta\) 2.8 at 3.1 (2H, \(m\)) corresponded to an ethyl group attached to the aromatic nucleus. Double irradiation experiments demonstrated that these five protons were mutually spin coupled.

These data, in combination with comparative analysis of the proton noise decoupled and single frequence off resonance decoupled 13C NMR spectra, allowed expansion of the partial structure to (CO)2 (C)2 (CH) (CH2)3

\[\begin{array}{l} {\text{Me}} \\ {\text{Et}} \\ {\text{H}} \\ \end{array}\quad({\text{Me}})_{3}.\]

These results, together with biogenetic considerations and the previous isolation of cleistanthane di terpenoids from plants of this family [7, 8], supported structure **5**. The chemical shift of the angular methyl carbon (d 21.3) also proved the A/B ring junction to be _trans_ with a carbonyl group at C-3. The absolute configuration of **5** was deduced by chemical correlation with cleistantha-8, 11,13-trien-7-one (7), isolated from _Yelloza leptopetala_[9] and of known absolute stereochemistry.

Catalytic hydrogenation of **5** in the presence of 10 % Pd-C at 62 psi in acetic acid gave compound **8**. However, when the reaction was run at 45 psi under otherwise identical experimental conditions, a mixture of **8** and **9** was obtained. The magnitude of the coupling constants for the carbonic proton in the 1H NMR spectrum of **9** indicates that the hydroxyl group has the equatorial (_b_) orientation. Reduction of ketone **8** with sodium borohydride in methanol afforded the alcohol **10** (IR: 3485 cm-1). This, upon dehydration with POCI3 in pyridine at room temperature furnished **11** (1H NMR: \(\delta\) 5.54, 2H, _m_). Catalytic reduction of olefin **11** in the presence of 10% Pd-C at 60 psi in ethyl acetate gave hydrocarbon **12**, previously obtained by hydrogenolysis of ketone 7 [9].

The crude extract (10 g) thus obtained was redissolved in CHCl3, absorbed on 0 log silica gel 60 and after evaporation of the solvent, placed on top of a column of 200 g of the same absorbent. Eluton was started with hexane and the polarity of the eluent increased gradually. Compounds were eluted in the following order, although in the first chromatographic fractionation the separations were not clear-cut, often requiring purification on smaller columns or by prep. TLC.
