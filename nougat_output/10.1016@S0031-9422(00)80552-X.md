# Catharinsine, an OXINDOLE ALKALOID FROM _Peschiera Catharinsinsis_

Angela R Araujo, Concetta Kascheres, Fred Fujiwara and Anita J Marsaoli

# Abstract

The structure of catharinsense isolated from _Peschiera catharnensis_ was deduced from a detailed analysis of its 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra. The synthesis of 17-demethoxyrhynchophylline confirmed its structure, and led us to suggest the configuration allo A for catharinsense Coronardine, isovacangne, heyneanme, 16-epaffinne, decarbonethoxyvoacamine and conodurine were also isolated

## INTRODUCTION

The presence of toxic plants in pastures is responsible for 5% of the cattle deaths in the State of Paranal, Brazil Giovannoni _et al_. [1] identified 54 toxic species and confirmed the presence of toxic principles in 12 Of these, _Peschiera catharinsens_ (DC) Miers (Apocynaceae, subtre Taberamontannae) was the only alkaloid-containing species not previously studied, _Peschiera_ represents an exclusvely Amercan genus and has not been fully investigated [2]

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

From the methanolic extract of the bark, we isolated a new alkaloid, catharinsense (1), together with coronazine (2), isovacangine (3), hexename (4), 16-epaffinine (5), decarbonethoxyvoacamine (6) and conodurine (7)

Catharinsense (1), C21H28N2O3, a light yellow, oily compound had [a]35 - 194deg, and a UV absorption spectrum analogous to that of isorhchophylline (8) [3, 4] suggesting that these two compounds possessed similar chromophores The 1H NMR assignments were based on comparison with isorhychophylline (8), rhynchophylline (9), cyronoxne (10) and isocorynoxne (11) [3, 4] The low-field doublet at d 7 56 (1H, \(J\) = 7 Hz) was indicative of a C-9 H and N-4 lone-pair interaction [3, 4] This and consideration of the most probable conformations of the eight possible diastereoisomers of the rychophyllinond type [4] suggested that 1 possessed either the configuration normal A, allo A, pseudo B or epallo B The presence of two singlets at d 5 46 and 6 46 and the lack of a peak attributable to a vinyl methyl ether group indicated a C-16 to C-17 terminal double bond

The mass spectrum of 1 displayed ions typical of a tetracyclic oxindole of the rlynchophylline type [5] (354 [M]+, 209 (ring D), 194 (ring D - Me), 180 (ring D - Et), 178 (ring D - OMe)) but these peaks were shifted to lower mass by 30 mu, thus indicating a modification in ring D of 1 compared with that of 8 Similarly, the differences in the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 8 were in the d-values of the ring D carbons and in the replacement of the olefinic quaternary and methane carbon resonances at 113 0 and 150 5 ppm assigned to C-16 and C-17, respectively, in 8 [6, 7] by the olefinic quaternary and methylene carbon resonances at 142 7 (C-16) and 125 2 (C-17) ppm, respectively. All these properties are consistent with structure 1 for catharinsense As this structure represents a novel oxindole alkaloid, the synthesis of 16 was undertaken to provide final confirmation and rlynchophylline (9) was taken as a startung material (Scheme 1) Only one of the two possible C-16 primers of 12 was obtained in 45% yield, by treatment of 9 with HgSO4-H2SO4 [8] followed by NaBH4-EtOH reduction Treatment of 12 with MgCl-proline m CH2Cl2 produced two mesplates, 13 and 14, in a ratio of 2 3 Because of the known C-7 isomerization of oxindole alkaloids in the presence of pyridine [3, 4] and the presence of a low-field doublet at d107 80 together with four singlets at d10 80 (-COOHe), 3 60 (-COOHe), 3 00 (-SOaMe), 2 84 (-SOaMe), it was concluded that the mesplates were C-7 primers Elimination of the mesyl group with DBN-CH2Cl2 at room temperature afforded 17-demethoxyrhynchophylline (15) and 17-demethoxysorhophylline (16) with the configuration normal B and normal A, respectively (taking into consideration that rlynchophylline (9), normal B [9], was our starting material and that the reactions should not alter the asymmetric centres, except for C-7) The mass spectra of 15, 16 and 1 had fragment ions with equal _m/z_ values but different relative abundances This fact and the nearly superimposable 1H NMR spectra of 15, 16 and 1 led us to the conclusion that these compounds were diastereoisomers. Thus the synthesis of 15 and 16 confirmed the proposed structure for 1 but not its configuration

Using the general procedure for configurational analysis of rlynchophylline-type alkaloids [4], we submitted a small sample of 1 to isomerization in pyridine After 48 hr,

the original alkaloid was still present m the equilbrium mixture thus indicating that compound 1 belongs either to the normal or the allo series

The non-symmetrical appearance of the C-18 methyl triplet signal in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 could have been indicative of a normal configuration [4] but this suggestion was eliminated by comparison with the 1H NMR spectra of 15 and 16 Hence we concluded that catharinsense (1) possessed the configuration allo A On the basis of this conclusion and also of the fact that the CD curves of corynoxine (10) (allo A) [4] and 1 are mirror images of each other (Fig 1), we suggest that these alkaloids have opposite absolute configuration and that catharinsense (1) is a 7\(R\),3\(R\),4\(S\),1\(S\),20_-oxindole alkaloid Semsynthess using corynoxine or coryran-clydome as starting maternal would certainly support our configurational suggestion, but unfortunately no samples of corynoxine or coryranthedine were available

## EXPERIMENTAL

1H NMR spectra were determined at 60 or 100 MHz using CDCl3 solns (unless indicated otherwise) and TMS as internal standard 13CNMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 at 25 2 MHz in the Fourier transform mode, the values are m ppm downfield from TMS [6(Me5H) = (CDC13) + 769] All mps are uncorr IR were recorded using thin films or KBr pellets Silica gel HF was utilized for TLC and spots were visualized by spraying
