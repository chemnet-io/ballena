piperonyl group must thus be linked to the carbonyl group. Strangely, the mass spectrum of 6e lacks another intense peak for 12e at _m/z_ 162 [11]. In our mass spectra the fragmentation ions 11 and 12 gave rise to intense peaks: 6a _m/z_ (rel. int.) 178 (100), 164 (97k 6b 178 (100), 162 (91k) 6c 178 (100); 6d 194 (100), 178 (99). Clearly the three new compounds possess a piperonyloyl residue and guaiacyl (6a), piperonyl (6b) and veratryl (6c) moieties, respectively.

The absolute configuration of (-)-galbumin (10) is known [12]. Since 10 can be obtained by acid-catalysed cyclization of 5 and 5 can be converted by oxidation into 6d, 5 and 6d must have the same chiralities at C-8 and C-8 as those known to occur in 10. The ORD and CD curves of 6d and of all the other representatives of series 6 show comparable Cotton effects and all these compounds thus have identical absolute configurations.

## Experimental

### Isolation of the constituents

A sample of the trunk of _N. puberula_ was collected from Cardoso Island (close to the southern littoral of Sao Paulo State) by Dr. Mario Motidome (Universidade de Sao Paulo). Identification of the species was done by Prof. Klaus Kubitzki (Universitat Hamburg). The sample was dried at room temp. and separated into bark and wood. Powdered bark (263 g) was extracted with CHCl, in a Soxhlet apparatus. The solvent was evaporated and the residue (59 g) was subjected to dry CC (190 g Merck silica gel 60; CHCl, EtOHa, 9:1). The column was cut into 25 parts of equal

length, each of which was extracted with CH2Cl2 MeOH. The solvents were evaporated. Residues 1, 2 and 3 were composed of fats. Residues 4, 5 and 6 were submitted separately to prep. TLC on silica gel developed with hexane Me2CO (9:1) followed by silica gel developed with C4H4. EtOAc (4:1) to give **6b** (33 mg) **6c** (34 mg) and **6a** (11 mg). Residue 4 was crystallized from Et2O to give 4 (65 mg). Residue 8 was purified by prep. Trp. (Cilixa gel C5H4-EtOAc 4:1) to give 5 (98 mg) Residues 9, 10 and 11 were submitted separately to prep. TLC on silica gel developed with C4H5, Me2CO (9:1) followed by silica gel developed with C4H4. EtOAc (4:1) to give 5 (98 mg) and 1a (80 mg). Powdered wood (3 kg) was extracted with CHCl2 in a Soxhlet apparatus. The solvent was evaporated. The residue (1:4 g) treated as above, gave 2 (38 mg) and 3 (27 mg).
