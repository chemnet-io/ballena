# Abstract

Two new alkaloids, 8-methoxycanthin-6-one and 3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione, were isolated from the EtOH extract of the bark of _Simaba cuspidata_ Spruce ex Engl. Elucidation of the structure of the latter compound included 13C NMR spectral comparison with 2-methoxypyridine-N-oxide and _N_-methoxy-2-pyridone.

## INTRODUCTION

_Simaba cuspidata_ Spruce ex Engl., var. _typica_ Conquist, an arborescent shrub or small tree, is common in the Rio Negro forest of Amazonas, Brazil [1]. Its bark gave an EtOH extract from which a yellow and a red alkaloid, characterized respectively as 8-methoxy-canthin-6-onc (**1a**) and 3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione (**2a**), were isolated.

## RESULTS

The yellow alkaloid (C15H10O2N2, mp 175-1769) shows in the IR spectrum a band at 1670 cm-1 in agreement with the presence of a lactam. The MS exhibits a M+ (_m/e_ 250) compatible with a methoxy-canthinone and a fragmentation pattern similar to that of other canthinones [2-4]. The UV spectrum is also compatible with a canthinone structure [2-5]: addition of acid, but not of base, causes a bathochromic shift of the maxima. The reduction product of the yellow alkaloid with Zn/HCl has a UV reminiscent of _b_-carboline derivatives [6]. The 1H NMR spectrum at 100 MHz permits a detailed analysis indicating the absence of substitution on rings C and D and the presence of a methoxy group. This must be located at C-8, since the signal at 88.13, attributed to H-7 by virtue of its low field location, shows no _ortho_-coupling (Table 1). Structure **1a** is therefore proposed.

The red alkaloid (mp > 320deg, strong green fluorescence in solution) shows in the IR spectrum an intense band at 1640 cm-1, indicating again at least one lactam carbonyl group. There is no evidence of OH groups. The high-resolution MS and elemental analysis signify a molecular formula of C15H10O3N2 with one more oxygen atom than **1a**. Otherwise, the MS is similar to that of **1a**, except for the facile loss of 31 amu, probably a OMe group, from the M+.

The UV spectrum is again in agreement with a cathinone structure. This time, however, the spectrum is not altered by the addition of either acid or base, indicating the absence of a phenolic function and the lack of basicity of _both_ nitrogen atoms. Again, the UV spectrum of the _T_n/HCl reduction product indicates a _b_-carboline.

The 1H NMR spectrum at 270 MHz, including the irradiation of each signal in turn, unambiguously establishes a sequence of 4 protons in ring A and of 2 protons in ring D (Table 1). Both the OMe gr- \(b\) and the additional oxygen must therefore be 1/c-c-c at ring C. This ring must also contain the only remaining proton, represented by a singlet at 87.27. This relatively high field position excludes one possible structure, 1-methoxycanthin-6-one-3-oxide (**5a**), since in the unsubstituted _N_-oxide, i.e. in canthin-6-one-3-oxide (**5b**), H-1 and H-2 appear at 87.78 and 8.32, respectively [4].

Thus only two structures need to be considered: 2-methoxycanthin-6-one-3-oxide (**5c**) and 3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione (**2a**). To enable the differentiation

of these possibilities, the 13C NMR spectrum of the natural product was obtained (Table 1). The methine carbon signals could be in part assigned by correlating residual couplings in the single-frequency off-resonance decoupled (sford) spectrum with the known 1H chemical shifts and by chemical shift considerations. A striking feature in the spectrum is the low field absorption of the OMe carbon (864.8), as compared with other Mo-aryl functions, e.g. 2-methoxy-pyridine (653.1) [7]. Since both _N_-oxide formation and the substitution of the OMe group on nitrogen could conceivably cause deshielding of the carbon in question, 2-methoxypyridine-_N_-oxide (3) and its thermal rearrangement product, _N_-methoxy-2-pyridone (4) [8-10] were run as models (Table 2). While the of basicity and the loss of OMe in the MS by fragmentation of the weak N--O bond.

## DISCUSSION

_Simaba indica_ Baill. has been excluded from the genus and named _Samandera indica_ (Baill.) Gaertn. [1]. Interestingly, however, it contains 2b (indacanthinone) [11], an isomer of 2a and the only additional known cathin-2,6-dione.

would then rearrange to **2a**. Such a rearrangement is a well known reaction [8-10] and one cannot, from present evidence, be certain that **2a** exists as such in the plant or if it is formed during the extraction or isolation procedures, thus adding one more question to several others [12] concerning the origin and role of \(N\)-oxides in plants.

## 6 Experimental

_Isolation of constituents._ A specimen of _S. cuspidata_ from the vicinity of Manaus, was identified by Dr. W. A. Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus, Amazonas. Air-dried, powdered trunk bark (1 kg) was extracted with EtOH. The solvent was evapd over Si gel and the residue extracted successively with petrol, CHCl3 and MeOH. The CHCl3-residue (10 g) was chromatographed on acid-washed Al2O3 (300 g, activity I). Elution with C6H6-CHCl3 6:4 and 1:1 afforded fractions which after repeated crystallizations from the indicated solvents gave respectively **1a** (40 mg, EtOH) and **2a** (80 mg, HOAc).
