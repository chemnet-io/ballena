## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation of constituents._ Fractionation of a seed extract [2] was carried out by dry CC. The column was cut into 33 portions. Portions 15-23, purified by repeated TLC, gave a major constituent (2.1 g [2]). Elution of one of the remaining bands on the plate gave 1 (35 mg). An additional quantity of fruits was collected from a specimen growing near Cajuru, Sao Paulo State, by Hipolito F. Paulino Filho, UNESP, Araraquara. The seeds were removed and the pericarp was dried, reduced to powder (1 kg) and extracted with C4H6 at room temp. The solvent was evaporated and the residue (31 g) crystallized from MeOH to give acylglycerols (10 g). The mother liquor was evaporated and the residue (21 g) submitted to dry CC (400 g Si gel, CHCl3-EtOAc, 19:1). The column was cut into three equal portions which were extracted with MeOH. Evaporation of the solns gave three residues corresponding to the lower (L), the middle (M) and the top (T) portions of the column. The residue L (7.1 g) was, in part (1.6 g), separated by TLC (Si gel, CHCl3-EtOAc, 9:1) into 2**a** (130 mg) and 2**c** (120 mg). The residue M (6.8 g), chromatographed on a Si gel column, gave **2b** (300 mg); besides other products which, as also the residue T (5.5 g), were not further examined.
