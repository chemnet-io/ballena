###### Abstract

During the course of a continuing phytochemical survey of Brazilian Velloziaceae, we have examined a sample of _Vellozia caput-ardaeae_ L. B. Smith & Ayensu, a species occurring in Diamantina, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Chromatographic fractionation on silica gel of the hexane extract of the stem, roots and leaf sheaths of _V. caput-ardae_ afforded two crystalline compounds, which were shown to be two new kaurenes.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The molecular formula of 12_b_-hydroxy-9,11-dehydroxurene (1) C20H39O, was determined by MS [M+ observed 286.2232 (68%), requires 286.2296]. The IR spectrum revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3 300 cm-1) and terminal methylene (870 cm-1) groups. The 12_b_NMR spectrum showed signals for three tertiary methyl groups (d 1.10, 0.92, 0.84), a carbonic proton (3.95, 1H, _dd_, \(J\) = 4.0 and 3.5 Hz), a terminal methylene (5.05, 1H, _br s_) and (4.90, 1H, _br s_) and trisubstituted double bond (d 5.30, 1H, _br d_). These data suggested a kaurene-type diterpene structure for compound I.

## INTRODUCTION

During the course of a continuing phytochemical survey of Brazilian Velloziaceae, we have examined a sample of _Vellozia caput-ardaeae_ L. B. Smith & Ayensu, a species occurring in Diamantina, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.

Chromatographic fractionation on silica gel of the hexane extract of the stem, roots and leaf sheaths of _V. caput-ardae_ afforded two crystalline compounds, which were shown to be two new kaurenes.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The molecular formula of 12_b_-hydroxy-9,11-dehydroxurene (1) C20H39O, was determined by MS [M+ observed 286.2232 (68%), requires 286.2296]. The IR spectrum revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3 300 cm-1) and terminal methylene (870 cm-1) groups. The 12_b_NMR spectrum showed signals for three tertiary methyl groups (d 1.10, 0.92, 0.84), a carbonic proton (3.95, 1H, _dd_, \(J\) = 4.0 and 3.5 Hz), a terminal methylene (5.05, 1H, _br s_) and (4.90, 1H, _br s_) and trisubstituted double bond (d 5.30, 1H, _br d_). These data suggested a kaurene-type diterpene structure for compound I.

Substance **1** was oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate which yielded an a,b-unsaturated ketone (\(\nu_{\max }^{\text{Eto}}\) 1660 cm-1; \(\nu_{\max }^{\text{Eto}}\) 248 nm, log \(e\) 4.392) identical with ketone **2** isolated from the plant. Analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of **2** showed downfield shifts for the protons of the terminal methylene group and for the proton on the trisubstituted double bond relative to the values observed for substance **1** (Table 1).

The positions of the trisubstituted double bond and hydroxyl group, located at C-9, 11 and C-12, respectively, were deduced by comparison of the chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spectra of **1** and **2** (Table 1) with the data recorded for the other kaurene-type diterpene 3 and **4**[1].

## EXPERIMENTAL

Mps are uncorr. The UV spectrum was measured in 95% EtOH. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz, in CDCl3 and chemical shifts (b ppm) measured from TMS as internal standard. Optical rotations were determined in CHCl3.

_Isolation of 12_b_-_hydroxy-9,11-_dehydroxurene_ (1) and 12-oxo-9,11-_dehydroxurene_ (2). Chromatography of the hexane extract (51 g) of roots, stem, and leaf sheaths of _Vellozia caput-ardae_, collected in Diamantina, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, yielded 12_b_-hydroxy-9,11-dehydroxurene (1), mp 143-144, 0.5% of dry plant wt; IR \(\nu_{\max }^{\text{Eto}}\) cm-1; 3300, 1640, 1020 and 870. 1H NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3.): d 8.04 (3H, s), 0.92 (3H, s), 1.10 (3H, s), 1.82 (1H, _br s_, exchangeable with D2O) 2.85 (1H, _br s_), 3.95 (1H, _dd_, \(J\) = 4 and 3.5 Hz), d 4.90 (1H, _br s_), 5.05 (1H, _br s_) and 5.30 (1H, _br d_). MS _m_/_e_ [rel. int.]: 286 M+ (68), 271 (81), 201 (19), 175 (22), 123 (25), 105 (35), 43 (100) and 41 (49).

Also isolated was 12-oxo-9,11-dehydroxurene (2), mp 131-132*, 0.06% of dry plant wt; IR \(\nu_{\max }^{\text{Eto}}\) cm-1: 2980, 1660 and 880. UV \(\nu_{\max }^{\text{Eto}}\) mm (log _e_) 248 (3.92), 1H NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3.): d 0.88 (3H, s), d 9.97 (3H, s), 1.18 (3H, s), 3.38 (1H, _br s_), 4.98 (1H, _br s_), 5.24 (1H, _br s_) and 5.71 (1H, _br s_), MS _m_/_e_ [rel. int.]: 284 M+ (100), 269 (32), 160 (19), 105 (15) and 41 (31).

_Oxidation of 12_b_-_hydroxy-9,11-_dehydroxurene_ (1). Pyridinium chlorochromate [2] (124 mg, 0.57 mmol) was added with stirring to a soln of 12_b_-hydroxy-9,11-dehydroxurene (100 mg; 0.34 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (2 ml). After 1.5 hr dry Et2O (10 ml) was added and the supernatant decanted from a black gum. The insoluble residue was washed thoroughly with dry Et2O (3 x 5 ml) whereupon it became a black granular solid. The

Ei2O solns were combined and filtered through a pad of florisil. The solvent was removed at red. pres. and crystals of 2, mp 131-132deg (70 mg, 70%) were obtained.
