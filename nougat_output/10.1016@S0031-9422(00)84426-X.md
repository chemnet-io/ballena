## (Received 8 December 1975)

Several indolopyridoquinazoline alkaloids have been reported as constituents of the yellow bark of _Euxylophora paraensis_ Hub. (Rutaceae) [1-5]. Further investigation of the fraction containing [-hydroxytutacearpine yielded a new related compound, euxylophoricine F, for which we now assign by spectroscopic methods structure (**I**), a conclusion confirmed by synthesis.

Euxylophoricine F, C15H15O3N3, M+ at _m/e_ 333, mp 226deg (C6H6-petrol), exhibits the same UV spectrum as the other euxylophoricines and similar NMR spectrum (CF3COOH + 20% CDCl3) which comprises two deceptively simple triplets at d 3.53 and 4.90 (J 7.0 Hz) for the ind -CH2-CH2-N< system, a singlet at 4.20 for a methoxyl group, a singlet at 7.92 for an aromatic proton, deshided by the neighbouring carbonyl group and a multiplet between 7.20 and 7.80 for 5 aromatic protons. The presence of a phenolic OH group was substantiated by IR absorption at 3300 cm-1 and by bathochromic shift to 304 nm in \(N\) aq. NaOH in UV spectrum. Methylation of (**I**) with MeI-K2CO3 in Me2CO yielded N13-methyleukaryothiophene A (**2**) indicating that euxylophoricine F was a 2.3-disubstituted rutacearpine [6]. That the hydroxyl group was located at carbon 2 was clarified by a 20% NOE for the integrated area of C-4H at d 7.90 on irradiating the methoxyl group at d 4.20.

The relationship between (**I**) and the known indolopyridoquinazoline was confirmed by its conversion into 3-methoxyturacearpine (**3**) removing the OH group by hydrogenolysis of the respective urethane [7]. Finally, condensation of 4-benzyloxy-5-methoxytanthranic acid methyl ester with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronharman-1-one in the presence of POCl3 and subsequent hydrogenolysis gave (**I**) [8].

The occurrence of euxylophoricine F with euxylophoricines A and C and paraensine [2] suggests that (**I**) may be the biogenetic precursor of the other three alkaloids.

## (Experimental

Equipment and procedures were described in a preceding paper [5].

_Isolation of euxylophoricine F._ Si gel chromatography of the mother liquors of the crystallization of 1-hydroxytruacearpine afforded a single product (_Rf_0.36; EtOAc-toluene-HCOOH, 4:5:1). Crystallization from C6H6-petrol gave pure euxylophoric F mp 226deg, as pale yellow needles. (Found: C, 68.34; H, 4.43; N, 12.72. C19H13N3O3 requires: C, 68.46; H, 4.54; N, 12.60% MS (1407) _m/e_ 333 (M+, 100%), 332 (227), 318 N, 12.60%), MS (1407) _m/e_ 333 (103), metastable peaks at 303.6 (M+-Me, 15%), 166.65 (130), metastable peaks at 303.6 (M333 - 318) and 264.44 (318 - 290); _v_m/e, 3300, 1650, 1630, 1580 and 1560 cm-1; _l_max (MeOH) 247, 337, 347 and 364 nm (log \(l\), 4.04, 4.45, 4.51 and 4.43; _l_max (MeOH) + _N_a_/D 304 nm; _l_max, MeOH + _N_a_/D 304 nm; _l_max, MeOH + _N_a_/D 302 nm. Methylation (MeI-Me2CO3-K2CO3) gave material, identical in TLC, UV and MS with an authentic sample of N13-methyleukaryothoricine A (**2**) [6].

_Conversion of_ (**I**) into 3-methoxyturacearpine (**3**). 10 mg of euxylophoricine F was stirred at room temp. in 25 ml dry C6H6 with 5 mg of phenyl isocyanate in the presence of E13N until TLC showed disappearance of starting material. Removal of the solvent furnished a solid which was dissolved in 10 ml HOAC and hydrogenated in the presence of 10 mg of 10% Pd-C for 72 hr. Preparative TLC of the crude material
