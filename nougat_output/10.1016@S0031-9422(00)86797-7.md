###### Abstract

Structures are proposed for rubrenolide, (2S,4R)-2-[(2S)-2',3'-dihydroxypropyl]-4-(dec-9''-enyl)-g-lactone, and rubrynolide, (2S,4R)-2-[(2'S)-2',3'-dihydroxypropyl]-4-(dec-9''-ynyl)-g-lactone.

## Introduction

In a preliminary communication [2] constitutions were proposed for rubrenolide (1a) and rubrynolide (1b), which may represent variants upon the biosynthetic routes to fatty acids [3]. In the present paper we wish to report the complete sequence of arguments which led to the constitutions and the absolute configurations of these structurally unique natural products isolated from the trunk wood of the Amazonian tree _Nectandra rubra_ (Mez) C. K. Allen [4].

### Constitutions of rubrenolide and rubrynolide

Rubrenolide, C11H30O4, and rubrynolide, C11H28O4, differed only in their degree of unsaturation, as indicated by their IR and NMR spectra. The IR spectrum of rubrenolide showed features characteristic of a long chain monoclakene with bands at 1635, 990 and 910 cm-1 attributable to a terminal vinyl group, whereas rubrynolide showed highly characteristic bands at 3280 and 2100 cm-1 associated with a terminal monoclayne. The NMR spectra of rubrenolide (1a) and rubrynolide (1b) were identical except for those features associated with the ally (1H \(\tau\) 7.97, 5.04, 419; 13C \(\delta\) 33.7, 138.7, 11.39) or propargyl (1H \(\tau\) 7.82, 8.06; 13C \(\delta\) 18.2, 84.5, 67.9) groups, respectively. Catalytic reduction transformed both rubrenolide and rubrynolide to the same derivative, dihydrobrenolide (1c), C11H23O4, which possessed a terminal methyl group (1HNMR \(\tau\) 9.4).

The IR spectra of 1a, 1b and 1c showed bands at 1745 and 1180 cm-1 typical of a lactone function which would account for the remaining two hydrogen deficiencies in dihydrobrenolide. Indeed, rubrenolide was soluble in dilute aqueous NaOH and could be recovered on acidification by extraction with ether (see below). Having accounted for two of the oxygens, the remaining two were shown to be present as one primary and one secondary hydroxyl group (_v_04 3450 cm-1) by reaction of rubrenolide with trichroacety inocyanate (TAI) [5]. After the addition of TAI to a deuteriochloroform solution of rubrenolide in an NMR tube, sharp one proton singlets appeared (\(\tau\) 1.19 and 1.26) due to the two NH groups of the carbamate ester formed. The signal at 6.27 in the NMR spectrum of rubrenolide moved downfield by 1.48 ppm, and the AB part of an ABX system centred in the spectrum of rubrenolide at \(\tau\) 6.37 and 6.52 shifted downfield to give a similar pattern centred at \(\tau\) 5.44 and 5.71. The two hydroxyl groups were shown to be vicinal by periodate oxidation of dihydrobrenolide which gave formaldehyde and an aldehyde (2a), C16H28O4, both characterised as the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding made a direct deduction of the lactone ring size in rubrenolide (_v_CO 1745 cm-1) rather uncertain, but the carbonyl frequencies associated with the lactone in the diacetyl (1d, 1e, 1f: _v_CO 1775 cm-1), bistrindystilbyl (1g, 1h: _v_CO 1760 cm-1), dimethyl (1l: _v_CO 1760 cm-1) and acetonide (1i, 1j: _v_CO 1770 cm-1) derivatives located the lactone function in a 5-membered ring.

In order to determine the nature of the rubrenolide-ethylnomide C17-skeleton, rubrenolide was converted to the saturated hydrocarbon C17H36 via the sequence 1a \(\rightarrow\) 3a \(\rightarrow\) 4a \(\rightarrow\) 4b. The alkane obtained was identified by direct IR, NMR, GLC and GC-MS comparison with an authentic sample of 4-methylhexadecane, prepared via Grignard synthesis from pentan-2-one and dodecylmagnesium bromide, followed by dehydration of the resulting 4-methylhexadecan-4-ol with phosphoric acid and catalytic reduction of the alkene. The MS of the synthetic and degradatively obtained alkanes were virtually identical. The branching point in the hydrocarbon chain is clearly at C-4. Characteristic peaks [6] of enhanced intensity relative to those in the spectrum of the straight chain isomer appeared at _m_/_e_ 225 (M-Me), 197 (M-C3H7) and 71 (M-C12H25).

Oxidation of rubrenolide with chronic oxide in refluxing aqueous acetic acid gave a mixture of decarboxylic acids which was esterified by treatment with diazomethane. The methyl ester mixture was analysed by

## Page 2

GC-MS and shown to be a mixture of dimethyl azelate (5a ~ 40 %) and dimethyl sebacate (5b ~ 60 %). At this stage two possible constitutions, 1a or 6, could be considered for rubrenolide. The 1,2-diol system or the vinyl group could occupy either terminal of the C16-chain, but the C1 branch must correspond to the carboxy group of the \(\gamma\)-lactone. Both of these structures could give rise to azelate and sebacic acid on vigorous oxidation. On mild oxidation with chromic oxide in aqueous acetic acid at room temperature, however, rubrenolide gave a vinylic acid, C16H26O4 (2e, \(v_{\max}\) 1645, 990, 910, 1760 and 1695 cm\({}^{-1}\)). The NMR spectrum of this acid showed two signals at 7.05 (1H, _dd_, \(J\) 17.5 and 3.5 Hz) and 7.49 (1H, _dd_, \(J\) 17.5 and 8.5 Hz), absent from the analogous spectrum of rubrenolide. These signals were assigned to a methylene group (geminal coupling constant 17.5 Hz) flanked on one side by an oxidatively generated carboxyl group and on the other by a methine. The formation of this product required the constitution of rubrenolide to be represented by the formula 1a.

### Structure of rubrenolide and rubrynolide

The constitutions of rubrenolide (1a), rubrynolide (1b) and dihydorurbrenolide (1c) are compatible with the detailed interpretation of their IR and NMR spectra, as well as the high resolution examination of their MS fragmentation patterns (Scheme 1). Peaks which are common to all three compounds appear at m/e 159, 116 and 

## Page 3

61. Other fragment ions have masses whose differences are due to differential constitution of the R-substituents of **1a**, **1b** and **1c**. The NMR spectrum of dihydrorubrenolide (**1c**) is more informative than that of rubrenolide (**1a**) or rubrynolide (**1b**) due to the absence of signals from either allylic or propargylic methylene protons. In the 220 MHz spectrum of dihydrorubrenolide (**1c**), seven distinct one proton multiplets are observed between \(t\) 5-8, in addition to a broad methylene signal with a peak at +- 8.70 and a terminal methyl triplet (_J_ 6.5 Hz) at +- 9.14. Double resonance experiments at 100 MHz revealed that the methine H-4 (_t_ 5.54) was spin coupled (_J_ 5.5 Hz) with H-3a (_t_ 7.45) and the methine of the secondary alcohol (_t_ 6.28) was spin coupled (_J_ 10 Hz) with one of the protons of the methylene at C-2 (+- 8.02), in agreement with the assignments given. Two one proton signals, those due to H-3\(b\) and the other proton at C-2, were obscured by the broad methylene band which extended down to +- 8.2. The position and exact nature of the resonance due to H-3\(b\) was of particular interest with regard to the configuration and conformation of the lactone ring. This seemed an ideal problem for solution by the LIS method with a suitable derivative. Indeed, addition of Eu(dpm)3 [7] to the monocalochol **2b**, prepared by borohydride reduction of **2a**, gave NMR spectra in which the chemical shift of H-3\(b\) was assignable by extrapolation to 0% complexing agent. The signal was expected to appear as a double double doublet, since H-3\(b\) is coupled to H-3\(a\) (_J_gen 12.5 Hz), H-2 and H-4, but the signal observed was an apparent quarter of approximate intensity ratio 1:3:3:1 and of width 36 Hz. This suggested that the vicinal coupling constants \(J\)2, _3\(b\) and \(J\)3_b_, \(4\) were of the same order (11-12 Hz) as the geminal coupling constant.

Further derivatives which proved useful for NMR study were the methyl esters **2d** and **2e** derived from the acid **2c**. The 220 MHz NMR spectrum of the ester **2e** clearly showed signals due to H-3\(a\) and H-3\(b\) at 7.42 and 8.40, respectively. H-3\(a\) appeared as a _ddd_ (_J_ 12.5, 8.5 and 5.5 Hz) partly obscured by the double doublet (_J_ 17.5 and 8.5 Hz) due to one of the protons of C-2 at +- 7.51; and H-3\(b\) appeared as an approximately symmetrical 1:3:3:1 quartet of width 35 Hz. 'Spin tickling' at +- 5.61, corresponding to H-4, caused the collapse of both of these multiplets, whereas all other signals in the spectrum remained apparently unchanged.

The complete assignment of all proton resonances and coupling constants associated with the _g_-lactone showed rubrenolide to possess the 2,4-_trans_ configuration. Comparison with analogous data given by some model _cis_ (7) and _trans_ (8) 2,4-disubstituted _g_-butyloctones (Table 1), specially synthesized for this purpose [8], yielded unequivocal proof of this fact.

Rubrenolide and its derivatives were all optically active. ORD curves were determined on rubrenolide (**1a**), rubrynolide (**1b**) and the two tetra-ols **3a** and **3b** obtained by respective aluminium hydride reduction. The curves for rubrenolide and rubrynolide were very similar, showing a positive Cotton effect and a peak maximum (_ph_ + 1700) at 226 nm. The two tetra-ols gave plain positive curves of very low amplitude. Application of the modified Hudson Lactone Rule [9] therefore enabled the assignment of the _R_-configuration to the chiral centre at C-4. C-2 must, consequently, possess the _S_-configuration. This allows both substituents of the lactone ring to be in _quasi_-equatorial position (9).

_A priori_ it could be imagined that hydrolysis of the lactone moiety in rubrenolide and relactonization with the alternative _g_-hydroxyl of the 2',3'-dihydroxypropyl group should be a facile reaction. In spite of several trials, such a reaction was not observed, rubrenolide being recovered as the sole lactonic product in all experiments. This may indicate that C-2' of the 2',3'-dihydroxypropyl group does not exist in the _R_-configuration which would allow both substituents of the hypothetical lactone again to occupy _quasi_-equatorial configurations. In order to understand lack of formation, this alternative lactone must be less stable, and it can be implied that C-2' exists in the _S_-configuration. Indeed, as expected, when Horeau's method [10] was applied to rubrenolide, or more precisely to its monomethyl ether **1m** in order to avoid esterification of the primary hydroxyl, d-a-phenyl-butyric acid was obtained in 31.3% optical yield.

The C6H6 extract (210 g) of a ground sample (5.4 kg) was washed with boiling petrol. The insoluble part (107 g) was suspended in hot MeOH and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated. The residue (74 g) was crystallized from CHCl3-CC4 to colourless crystals (40 g), mp 91-93deg, [a]12+22deg (CHCl3), one TLC spot. The crystals (3.45 g) in 95deg, EtOH (30 ml) were added to a 5% solution of AgNO3, in 95% EtOH (150 ml).
