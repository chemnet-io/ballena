###### Abstract

Seven neolignans, isolated from a C6H6 extract of _Nectandra miranda_ (Lauraceae) trunk wood, included the hitherto undescribed (2\(S\), 3\(S\), 3a_S_)- and (2\(S\), 3\(S\), 3a_R_)-5-allyl-3a-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2, 3, 3a, 6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran; 7-allyl-6-hydroxy-5- methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methylbenzofuran; (2\(R\), 3_R_)-7-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-5-(2-propyl)-2-3-dihydroxybenzofuran; (2\(S\), 3\(S\), 3a_S_)-3a-ally-5-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2, 3, 3a, 6, tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran; (2\(S\), 3\(S\), 5'-ethyl-5-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2, 3, 5, 6'-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran; (2\(S\), 3_S_)-6-allyl-5-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2, 3-dihydroxybenzofuran.

## Introduction

The biosynthesis of the guianin (4) [2, 3] and burchellin (5a) [3-6] type neolignans of _Aniba_ species involves, presumably, the oxidative coupling of properly- and allylpphenols, either by radical pairing (1 + 2) [7] or through ionic intermediates. It suffices to postulate the existence of the allylphenol derived intermediate in a mesomeric form to rationalize the formation (1 + 3) of macrophyllin (6) [8] and to justify the expectation that the alternative type 7 also should be represented in nature. This is indeed the case and we now report that _Nectandra miranda_, Lauraceae, contains the mirandins A (7a) and B (7b).

## Results and discussion

### 3a-Methoxybenzofuran neolignans

The mirandins A and B were recognized as neolignans by their formulae, C1*H1*O2*(OMe), and spectra; the similar 1H-NMR and MS (_m_/_e_ 208, 100 %) clearly pointing in both cases to partial structure 8 with the Ar and Me groups in a _trans_-relationship [4]. The additional C6*C3*unit must be represented by a cycloheximide [Vmax (cm-1) mirandin A 1667; mirandin B 1680] linked at the sole and fully substituted sp3-C to a methoxyl (r mirandin A 7.00; mirandin B 6.88) and at a sp2-C to an allyl group, as in 7. The allyl can, indeed, be located only on a sp2-C, the doubly allylic methylene protons being equivalent (r mirandin A 6.89; mirandin B 6.84, both \(d\), \(J\) = 7.0 Hz). Among the 3 possible sites, C-7 and C-4 are incompatible with the representation of the ring olefinic protons by MR singlets and the biosynthesis which requires the allyl group to be _para_-related with an oxy-function.

Since both compounds are represented by formula 7, they must differ in the orientation of the aliphatic methoxyl. Indeed, the conspicuous differences in the 1H-NMR spectra, all refer to signals attributed to protons of the immediate vicinity of C-3a. Most significantly, the H-3 signal of mirandin-A appears 0.49 ppm downfield from the H-3 signal of mirandin-B. This seems to indicate association of H-3 to OMe-3a in mirandin-A (7a), in contradistinction to the _trans_ relation of H-3/OMe-3a in mirandin-B (7b). Indeed, the analogous association is apparent in the 1H-NMR spectrum of _2-epi_-mirandin-A (7e), the product of isomerization by acid of 7a. Comparison of the three spectra reveals additionally the expected relative shielding of methoxyl only in the 2,3a-_cis_-derivative 7a (Table 1).

Photolysis or pyrolysis of mirandin-A leads to 9, a compound which was obtained previously by pyrolysis of the naturally occurring 10 [5], and identified intensively with respect to stereochemistry. Thus, 7a registers the absolute configuration of mirandin-A.

In solution, the aryl and cyclodienone moieties of

mirandin-A (7a) possess a fair degree of coplanarity, determining relatively intense UV absorption (_e_ 21 000) and low IR carbonyl frequency (1666 cm-1), together with a dihedral angle H-(2)-C(3)-H of about 90deg (_J_N_-2,H-3 = 0.5 Hz). The Cotton effects associated with the benzenoid and enone chromophores are both positive and cause an unresolved ORD curve between 250-310 nm. In contradistinction, mirandin-B (7b) is a twisted structure (_e_ 12100, v 1680 cm-1) with the dihedral angle approaching 180deg (_J_N_-2,H-3 = 9.5 Hz). The Cotton effects associated with the two chromophores are of opposite signal in the region of benzenoid (300 nm) and enone (280 nm) absorptions (Table 2), and cause a well resolved ORD curve. Correlation of the signal of these Cotton effects with aryl and methoxyl configuration was effected by analysis of the ORD curve of 2-_epi_-mirandin-A (7c). This was derived from mirandin-A (7a) by epimerization only of C-2. In consequence, no doubt exists concerning the (2_R_)-configuration, associated with a negative Cotton effect in the 310 nm region, the (3aS)-configuration, associated with a positive Cotton effect around 280 nm, and the (3_S_)-configuration of its chiral centres. Mirandin-B, which causes a positive Cotton effect in the 310 nm region and a negative Cotton effect in the 280 nm region, must consequently possess the absolute configuration registered in 7b.

Configuration and conformation of the mirandins are also discussed in a paper on the 13C-NMR spectra of neolignans [9].

_Other benzofranoid neolignans_

Further compounds of _Nectandra miranda_ include sitosterol, the ferulate of a fatty alcohol, 6,7-dimethoxy-coumarin and 5 neolignans: the known [5] (2S, 3S, 3a,S)-3a-allyl-5-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2, 3, 3a, 6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran (5b), (2S, 3S, 5R)-5d-allyl-5-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2, 3, 5, 6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran (11) and (2S, 3S)-6-0-allyl-5-methoxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (10), and the previously unknown C18H11O.OH(OMe)4 (12a) and C18H14O(OMe)4 (13a).

Both 12a and 13a were recognized as neoligans through their molecular formulae and classified according to type by 1H-NMR, the spectra being partly superimposable, respectively, on the spectra of 7-allyl-6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2-piperonylbenzofuran (12b) [6] and of the lacrian-type [10] compound (2R, 3R)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-5-(E)-propenyl-2-vertryl-2, 3-dihydrobenzofuran (13b) [3] from _Amba_ species. The differences in these pairs of spectra refer only to signals due to the aryl substituents of 12a and 13a (3 OMe) and 12b and 13b. The closeness of the ORD curves of 13a, designated lacarin-C[11], and 13b [3] demonstrates their identical absolute stereochemistry.

## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation of the constituents._ The C6H6 ext. (5b g) of a trunk wood sample (7.1 kg) of _Nectandra mirrada_ Sandw. (Voucher: Herbarium IPEAN, Belem, 120.907) from the IPEAN Forest Reserve near Belem, Part) was separated into petrol soluble and insoluble portions. The former (8 g) was chromatographed on Si gel, C6H6 eluting in order the relative of a fatty alcohol (220 mg), 12a (80 mg), a mixture of 13a (1.7 g) and 10 (40 mg) which was separated by preparative TLC, 7b (15 mg) and 7a (5 g). The insoluble portion (34 g) was freed from fatty material with hot MeOH. The residue (9 g) was chromatographed on Si gel, solvent of increasing polarity tilting in order 7a (2 g), sitosterol (550 mg), 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin (350 mg), 11 (1.9 g), 5b (50 mg) and a complex mixture (27 g). The known compounds were identified by direct comparison. Previously reported as a viscous oil [5], 11 was obtained as crystals, mp 110-111deg (hexane-C6H6).

_Photolysis of mirandin-_A. A 2 mM soln of 7a in MeOH under N2 was irradiated by a 450 W medium pressure mercury lamp (Hanovia) either for 30 min (without Pyrex filter) or for 120 min (with Pyrex filter). The solns were evap, and the residues fractionated into constituents by TLC. Relative yield of 9: 8 % (with filter) and 25 % (without filter). The compound was identical in all respects, including ORD to (2S, 3S)-5-allyl-6-hydroxy-2-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxyphenyl-3-methyl-2, 3-dihydrobenzofuran (9). The published data [5] must be revised with respect to mp 196-198' (C6H6-petrol) and ORD [6]-values to be reduced by a factor of 7.

_Pyrolysis of mirandin-_A. Solns of 7a in C6H6N2L under N2 were maintained at 100deg and 200deg for 5 hr. The cooled reaction mixtures were treated by a described procedure [5]. TLC indicated recovery of starting material in the run at 100deg. The run at 200deg gave 7a and 9 (50% yield).

_Isomerization of mirandin-_A. A soln of 7a (240 mg) and TsOH (1 mg) in dry MeOH (15 ml) was kept at room temp. (48 hr). The solns was neutralized with NaHCO3 and evap. The residue was separated by Si gel-IT-CC5H6-A-COGE4 (8:2) into 7e (50 mg), 7a (140 mg) and a mixture (30 mg).
