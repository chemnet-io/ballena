###### Abstract

The wood of _Platymiscium praecox_ Mart. (Leguminose-Lotoideae) contains sitosterol, 4,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone, (2_R_)-7-hydroxyflavanone, (+-)7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone, (2\(S\), 3_S_)-3,7-dihydroxyflavanone, 3,7'-dihydroxyflavone, 3,7'-dihydroxyflavone, 3,7'-dihydroxyflavone, 6,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone and 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin. It also contains three novel compounds: 7-hydroxy-4-methoxy-5-methylcoumarin, 7-O-glucosyloxy-4-methoxy-5-methylcoumarin and 7-hydroxy-4,8-dimethoxy-5-methylcoumarin.

_Platymiscium praecox_ Mart. (Leguminose-Lotoideae) is an arboreous species which occurs near Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Its trunkwood yielded a series of crystal-line compounds which were classified by their spectra as a chalcone, three flavanones, two flavones, an isoflavone and four coumarins.

The chalcone and one of the flavonones were identified with the well known 4,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone (isoliquiritigenin) and (+-)7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone (liquiritigenin)3 through direct comparison with synthetic samples.4,5 The spectral characterization of the second flavanone as (2_R_)-7-hydroxyflavanone was consubstantiated by direct comparison with synthetic (+-)-7-hydroxyflavanone.6, - 8

The PMR spectrum of the third flavanone included the pair of doublets typical of the AB system of vicinal protons at positions 2 and 3 of 3-hydroxyflavanones.9 The B part of this signal was shifted paramagnetically by 1:2 ppm upon acetylation of the compound, confirming the existence of a secondary carbinol. The remaining features of the PMR spectrum defined the substitution pattern of the aromatic rings and, in conjunction with

MS and ORD data,10 led to the structure of (2\(S\), 3_S_)-3,7-dihydroxyflavanone. Only synthetic (+-)3,7-dihydroxyflavanone has been described previously.11

The flavones were identified as 3,7-dihydroxyflavone and 3,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone by spectral means. The data obtained for these isolates and for the derived acetates are in agreement with the data reported for synthetic 3,7-dihydroxyflavone,12,13 as well as for synthetic14 and natural15 3,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone.

The PMR spectrum of its diacetate identified the isoflavone unequivocally with 6,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone (texasin), previously detected in _Baptisia australis_ by PC.16 The isolate has a m.p. and gave UV and IR spectra as required by the literature for synthetic specimens.17-19

One of the four coumarins of _P. praecox_ was identified with 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin (aesculetin dimethyl ether) isolated previously from plants.20,21 The remaining three compounds were immediately recognized as unusual: their PMR spectra indicated in each case the presence of a _C_-methyl group. This fact, combined with elementary, mass spectral and functional analyses, led to the formula C9H3O2. CH3. OH. OCH3 for one of them. The hydroxyl must be placed at a position such as C-7, conjugated with the carbonyl, since upon methylation and upon acetylation a shift of the IR carbonyl stretching band from 1700 to 1725 cm-1 was observed. Two of the three undefined hydrogens in the formula must be _meta_-related and both vicinal to the hydroxyl. In the acetate they give rise to a pair of doublets (_J_ 2:5 Hz) at a significantly lower field (_t_ 3:10 and 3:25) than in the methyl ether (2 proton singlet, \(t\) 3:40). The third hydrogen was placed at the 3 position of the heterocyclic, in view of the relatively small chemical shift of its PMR signal [_s_, \(t\) 4:50 (methyl ether), 4:40 (acetate)]. At this point two structural alternatives (I and IIb) had to be considered for the methyl ether. A synthetic sample of 5,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (I), however, proved to be different, upon direct comparison, with this derivative. Most significantly, the PMR signal due to the _C_-methyl group of the synthetic compound appeared as a doublet (_t_ 7:48, \(J\) 1:5 Hz) and the vicinal olefinic proton gave a quartet (_t_ 4:06, \(J\) 1:5 Hz), as in other coumarins and chromones of this type. In contradistinction, methyl substituted aromatics with a free _ortho_-position, usually show the methyl proton signal as a

somewhat widened singlet, an observation extensive to the spectra of the methyl ether and the acetate of our natural product. This must then possess the structure of 7-hydroxy-4-methoxy-5-methylcoumarin (IIa). The entire analysis, however, had relied upon an original postulate which formulated the compound as a coumarin. It was thus deemed desirable to confirm the proposal by degradative and synthetic studies.

Initially it was ascertained that vigourous alkaline treatment of the isolate does lead, as expected,22 to 2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylacetophenone, or, under methylating conditions, to 2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylacetophenone. The acetophenones, obtained in good yield, were identified by direct comparison with synthetic samples.23,24 The substitution of the aromatic ring thus having been confirmed, our attention was directed towards the heterocyclic. 4-Methoxycoumarins are easily demethylated upon reflux with 18 % aq. HCl for short periods.25 Indeed, when the methyl ether of the natural compound was submitted to this procedure, 4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-5-methylcoumarin resulted. This was characterized unequivocally by direct comparison with a synthetic sample, obtained from 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-methylacetophenone23 and diethyl carbonate in the presence of sodium,26 and was converted to the methyl ether of compound IIa by treatment with dimethyl sulphate. The structure of 7-O-glucosyloxy-4-methoxy-5-methylcoumarin (IIe) was attributed to the third coumarin, when it was found that its acid hydrolysis leads to glucose and IIa.

To the fourth coumarin we assign tentatively the structure of 7-hydroxy-4,8-dimethoxy-5-methylcoumarin (IIIa). The PMR spectra of IIIa and IIa are very similar, inclusively with respect to indications of benzylic coupling involving an aromatic proton and the _C_-methyl protons. The significant difference refers to the presence of a sole aromatic proton signal in the spectrum of IIIa (a singlet at \(t\) 3:31), the additional aromatic proton signal being replaced by a methoxyl singlet (_t_ 6:10). An alkaline degradation was performed on the small quantity available. The amount of acetophenone (positive FeCl3-test) obtained, however, was too small for full characterization.

## EXPERIMENTAL

M.ps. were taken on the Koffer block and are uncorrected. Column chromatography employed Merck's Kieselgel 0-05-0-20 mm. PMR spectra were taken on a Varian HA-60-IL instrument, TMS was used as internal standard, _s_--singlet, _d_--doublet, _dd_--double doublet, _m_--multiplet. MS were recorded with an AEI MS9 instrument. ORD curves were recorded with a Cary 60 spectropolarimeter. The acetates were obtained with Ac2O-pyridine at room temp. Unless otherwise stated, the methyl ethers were obtained with Me2SO4-K2CO3-acetone under reflux.

_Isolation of the constituents of_ Platymiscium praecox. Softwood (7 kg) and heartwood (10 kg) were extracted successively with benzene and with EtOH. A portion (25 g) of the benzene extract (48 g) of the softwood was chromatographed on silica (600 g), yielding the following useful fractions with the indicated eluants: \(A\)1 (benzene), \(A\)2 and \(A\)3 (CHCl3-MeOH, 97:5:2:5). \(A\)1 was recrystallized from EtOH-H2O (1:1) giving sitosterol (90 mg). \(A\)2 and \(A\)3 were recrystallized from toluene-AcOH (1:1) giving IIa (210 mg) and IIIa (169 mg). A portion (15 g) of the EtOH extract (180 g) of the softwood was chromatographed on silica (450 g), yielding the following useful fractions with the indicated eluants: \(B\)1 (CHCl3-MeOH, 9:1), B2 (CHCl3-MeOH, 4:1). \(B\)1 was recrystallized from toluene-AcOH (1:1) giving IIa (189 mg). \(B\)2 was recrystallized from MeOH giving IIe (128 mg).

Upon partial concentration and cooling of the benzene solution obtained by extraction of the heartwood, a solid (28 g) precipitated. This was separated by filtration and chromatographed on silica (450 g), yielding the following useful fractions with the indicated solvents: C1-C6 in order (CHCl3), C7 (CHCl3-MeOH, 1971).
