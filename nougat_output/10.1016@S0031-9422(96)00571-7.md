# Abstract

The leaves of _Khaya senegalensis_ yielded two new limonoids. These compounds were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as methyl 1a-acetoxy-3b,6,8a-trihydroxy-2a-methoxy-2b,14b-epoxy-[4.2.110,30,114]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate and methyl 1a-acetoxy-6,8a,14b,30b-tetrahydroxy-3-oxo [3.3.1102,114]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate. Scopoletin, b-quercitrin and rutin were also isolated. Copyright (c) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd

## INTRODUCTION

Recently, we have described the isolation and identification of three limonoids, methyl 1a,6,8a,14b,30b-pentahydroxy-3-oxo[3.3.1102,114]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate; methyl 1a,2b,3a,6,8a,14b-hexahydroxy-[4.2.11030,114]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate and methyl 1a-acetoxy-2b,3a,6,8a,14b-pentahydroxy-[4.2.11030,114]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate (1.0

relations from 2-OMe to the signals of H-30 and H-3 showed that the methoxyl group was thus in the a-configuration. Moreover, the observed correlation of 2-OMe with H-15\(b\) implied that they were close to each other in space and suggested that the 2-OMe, together with the cyclic ketal function, may have caused a downfield shift for H-15_b_(1: d 3.50; 3: d 2.69). The new natural product was therefore identified as methyl 1a-acetoxy-3\(b\),6,8a-trihydroxy-2a-methoxy-2b_,14_b_-epoxy-[4.2.10,30.11,4]-tricyclomelanic-7-oate (1).

The limonoid **2**, exhibited similar NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) to methyl 1a,6,8a,14\(b\),30_b_-penta-hydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.1102.11,4]-tricyclomelanic-7-oate (4) [1], except for the presence of a tertiary acetoxyl (d_C 170.2, 22.0; d_h_ 2.02 _s_). Significant upfield shifts for C-2 and C-29 in the 13C NMR spectrum, when compared with **4** and its 1a,6-diacetoxy derivative **4a**[1], determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. Thus, the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as methyl 1a-acetoxy-6,8a,14\(b\),30_b_-tetrhydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.1102.11,4]-tricyclomelaic-7-oate (2).

In biogenetic terms, a pinacid pinacolone rearrangement of a 2,3,30-trihydroxy-1,29-cyclomelaicate precursor may have occurred, resulting in a 2-oxo-tricyclo-[4.2.110,30.11,4]-decane. Subsequent reduction or addition of an hydroxyl group at C-14 to ketone and _O_-2-methylation may have led to the limonoids **3** and **1**, respectively.

## Experimental

_General_. NMR: Bruker ARX 400 with TMS as int. standard; EI-MS: 70 eV, direct probe insert and elevated temp, low resolution on a HP-5988 instrument; PIDCI-MS (isobutane): 70 eV, low resolution on a VG Plataform II (Fisons) instrument.

_Plant material. Khaya sneagalensis_ was collected in Viposa, MG, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestal, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, MG.

_Isolation of compounds_. Ground leaves (2000 g) were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. The concd MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2-, EtOAc- and _n_-BuOH-soluble frs. The concd CH2Cl2 extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient

yielded 22 frs. Frs 1-4 were purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 25:25:2) to yield scopoletin (4 mg). Frs 5-7 were rechromatographed over silica gel using CH2Cl2-MeOH (98:2) and then recrystallized in CHCl3-MeOH, yielding compound **1** (30 mg). Frs 14-16 after CC over silica gel cutting with hexane-CHCl3-MeOH (15:9:1) yielded compound **2** (10 mg). The concord EtOAc extract yielded a ppt. of b-quercitrin (400 mg). The concord _n_-BuOH extract yielded a ppt. of ruin (500 mg).
