Moreover, the chemical shifts of the ring B-E carbons were comparable with those reported for **2** (Table 2) [4, 5]. The new natural product was therefore identified as 1a-methoxy-1,2-dihydropyedunin.

In order to confirm that **9** is a genuine natural product and was not derived from addition of methanol to the 1-en-3-one system, a solution of **2** in methanol with a small amount of silica gel added was stirred for three weeks at room temperature. After removal of solvent, the 1H NMR spectrum of the recovered material indicated that no reaction occurred. This observation, together with the fact that the stem examined did not give the two possible primers at C-1, provided conclusive evidence that **9** is naturally occurring.

The 1H-1H COSY, TOCSY, HMQC and HMBC on 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (**8**) permitted minor corrections to previous 1H and 13C NMR assignments [8]. The signals for H-5 and H-22 (Table 1) and C-4, C-9, C-10, C-16 and C-22 (Table 2) were reassigned.

An ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the stem of _C. odorata_ graft afforded the limonoids **2**, 3b-deacetylfissinolide (**11**) [10], the flavonoid catechin [11] and the new cycloartane **12**.

Compound **12** showed the spectral characteristics

of a triterpene glycoside. Acetylation of **12** with acetic anhydride in pyridine gave a tetra-acetate (**12a**). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of **12a** and cycloucalenol (**1**) [3] were very similar. The presence of a 2,3,4,6-tetra-_O_-acetyl-_b_-glucopyranoside linked at C-3\(b\) was indicated by the proton signal at \(d\) d 3.12 (_dt_, \(J\) = 10.5 and 4.8 Hz, H-3a) and the 13C signal at \(d\) 88.0 (Table 2). The configuration of the amomeric position of the glucose moiety was assigned to be \(b\) from the coupling constant of the amomeric proton (_d_ 4.58 \(d\), \(J\) = 8.0 Hz). The nature of the sugar was confirmed by a comparative analysis of the 13C NMR data for **12a** with those of quinovic acid 3_b_-_O_-_b_-d_-glucopyranoside pereacetyl dimethyl ester (**13**, a dimethyl urs-12-en-14,17-dioate) [12]. Thus, compound **12** was concluded to be 3_b_-_O_-_b_-d_-glucopyranosideenol.

As reported previously [13], limonoid biosynthesis in _Cedrela_ proceeds along only one route, which leads

to the ring-d lactone derivatives (**2-5** and **9**) and then to the mexicanolide group (**6** and **11**). Thus, _C. odorata_ graft produces a considerable number of limonoids which are common in _Cedrela_, but **3**, **7**, **11** and the apotirucallane **8** were not previously found from the latter. Compounds **7** and **8** are typical of the _Toona_[13], but they might be the biosynthetic intermediates to _Cedrela_ limonoids.

Studies of the structure/anti-insect activity relationships for several limonoids have established that aside from the C-_seco_-limonoids, the most active compounds appear to be intact apo-euphol limonoids with a 14,15-epoxide and a 3-oxo-1-ene A ring. Absence of the 14, 15_b_-epoxide results in reduced activity, as with **7**[14]. Thus, the finding of both limonoids **7** and **8** is of little value to clarify the basis of induced resistance in the graft.

Stigmasterol and campesterol do not appear to have been recorded previously from _C. odorata_ and _T. ciliaa_. However, they are of widespread distribution and thus possibly of little chemotaxonomic interest. Representatives of the cadence series of sesquiterpenes have been reported from the stems of _C. odorata_ and _T. ciliaa_[2, 15], but calcanene is known only from the former. Flavonols and 3-glycoside derivatives were found in leaves of _C. sinensis_[16], but not so far in

any other _Cedrela_. Proanthocyanidins have otherwise been reported from only a single _Toona_ species (stem of _T. ciliata_) [17].

The genus _Cedrela_ has been widely investigated, but, to date, there are no records of cycloartanes. Our own investigations of the stem and leaves of _T. ciliata_ revealed the presence of cycloeucalenol (**1**) and **12** (unpublished results). Since the latter types and orthocyanidins have not been found in _C. odorata_, the occurrence of both cycloartanes (**1** and **12**) and catechin (in great amounts) in the graft suggests that these constituents could have been translocated from the _Toona_ stock to the _Cedrela_ graft. However, both species should be re-examined for condensed tannins and their precursors (as catechin), and _C. odorata_ for cycloartanes.

## IX Experimental

NMR: Bruker ARX 400, with TMS as int. standard; GC-MS: low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument; EIMS and DCIIMS: 70 eV, low resolution on a VG Plataforn II (Fisons) instrument, R-HPLC (recycling HPLC): model Shimadzu LC-6AD; the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 x 20 mm, 5 \(\mu\)m particle size, 100 A pore diameter; eluent: CH2Cl2-MeOH (49:1); flow rate: 2.5 ml min-1; detection (Shimadzu SPD-6AV): UV \(\lambda\) 240 and 215 nm.

_Plant material. Cedrela odorata_ grafted on _T. ciliata_ var. _australis_ was collected in Vicosa, MG, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of the Departamento de Engenharia Flowestal, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, MG.

_Isolation of compounds_. Ground stems (3 kg, 5-year-old tree and stems worked with a diameter of 30 cm) were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. The concd MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2, EtOHac and _n_-BuOH soluble frs. The concd CH2Cl2-soluble fr. was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient afforded 20 frs. Fr. 1 was purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane) to yield calamenene (9 mg). Frs 3-5 were flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-EtOAc-MeOH (94:5:1) affording **2** (490 mg) and 20 new frs. Frs 3/15-16 were recrystallized in MeOH yielding 1 (19 mg). Frs 7-8 were flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-EtOAc-MeOH (69:30:1) affording 10 new frs. Frs 7/2-4 yielded, after crystallization in MeOH, an amorphous solid characterized by low resolution GC-MS as a mixt. (78 mg) of sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol. Frs 7/5-6 were flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH (49:1) affording **2** (240 mg). Fr. 7/7 was rechromatographed as above to afford **2** (260 mg) and **3** (82 mg). Frs 7/9-10 were recrystallized in MeOH yielding **4** (78 mg) and fr. 9/1, which was rechromatographed as above, to afford new frs (9/1a and 9/1b). Fr. 9/1a (20 mg) was submitted to R-HPLC (detection UV \(\lambda\) 215 nm) affording, **5** (3 mg), after recycling \(\times\) 2, **2** (1st peak, 3 mg) and **9** (2nd peak, 7 mg), after recycling \(\times\) 3. Fr. 9/1b (20 mg) was submitted to R-HPLC (detection UV \(\lambda\) 240 nm) affording **8** (2 mg), after recycling \(\times\) 3, 7 (6 mg), after recycling \(\times\) 4, and **6** (8 mg), after recycling \(\times\) 5.

The concd EtOAc-soluble fr. of the MeOH extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient afforded 20 frs. Frs 1-2 were submitted to CC over silica gel eluting with CH2Cl2-MeOH (99:1) affording **2** (750 mg) and 15 new frs. Frs 1/12-13 were twice flash chromatographed on silica gel (CH2Cl2-MeCO, 24:1; hexane-EtOAc-MeOH, 50:50:1) yielding **11** (13 mg). Fr. 7 was recrystallized in MeOH yielding **12** (37 mg). Fr. 11 was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (3:5:2) affording **12** (3 mg) and catechin (460 mg). Compound **12** was allowed to react overnight with an excess of Ac2O in pyridine. Work-up as usual yielded 3\(\beta\)-O(2',3',4',6'-tetra-O-acetyl-\(\beta\)-d-glucopyranosyl)cyclohexoucalenol (**12a**).
