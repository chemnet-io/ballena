Edna A. P. Passador, M. Fatima das G. F. da Silva, Edson Rodrigues Fo, Joao B. Fernandes, Paulo C. Vieira and Jose R. Pirani

# Abstract

The hexane extract from the stems of _N. magnifica_ var. _magnifica_, afforded two new flavonoids: 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethylacry-5',6'-(2',2'-dimethylpyran)chalcone and 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethyloxyflavanone which were identified on the basis of spectroscopic methods. The known flavonoids 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5'-pentamethoxychalcone, 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanone and 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone, the sterols stosterol and stigmasterol were also identified. These results do not seem to support the affiliation of _Neoraputia_ to the tribe Cusparieae. (c) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved

## INTRODUCTION

_Neoraputia magnifica_ (Engler) Emmerich is a tree found only in northwestern Brazil [1]. It was originally described by Engler as a species of _Raputia_ Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus _Neoraputia_ Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them form _Raputia_ and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae [1]. No previous phytochemical work has been reported on _Raputia_. Recently, we have described the isolation and identification of eight polymethoxylated flavones and one flavanone from _N. alba_[2, 3]. Little is known about the chemistry of the _Neoraputia_, but, to date, it differs from other taxa of the tribe Cusparieae, notably by the absence of anthranilate alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids [4]. The extensive O-methylation of highly oxygenated flavones is a feature that is largely confined to the Citroideae [5]. Thus, our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae stimulated an investigation of another plant of the _Neoraputia_ genus, e.g. _N. magnifica_ var. _magnifica_ (Engler) Emmerich.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The hexane extract from the stems of _N. magnifica_ var. _magnifica_, afforded two new flavonoids **1** and **3**, besides three known flavonoids 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone (**2**) [6], 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanone (**4**) [2] and 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (**5**) [7], and a mixture of stosterol and stigmasterol were also identified. These results do not seem to support the affiliation of _Neoraputia_ to the tribe Cusparieae. (c) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved

implies that the methoxyl in the A-ring is located at C-4' (d 55.9), and determined the position of the chromene ring between C-5' and O-6'. This was supported by the 1H NMR spectrum run in C6D6 which showed upfield shift (Dd > 0.3) for three methoxyls [8]. Moreover, the existence of correlation between the 1H signal at d 6.07, assigned to H-3' (by HMQC and HMDC), and the 1C signal at d 102.9 (C-5'), confirmed the position of the chromene ring between the C-5' and O-6'. The new natural product is therefore 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5'-tetramethyloxy-5',6'-(2',2"-dimethyl-pyran)chalcone (1). The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',6'-tetramethylochalcone (6) and 2'-hydroxy-3',4',5',6'-di-(2",2"-dimethylpyran)chalcone (7, hemicellulose) [9].

It has been noted that the H-b and C-b of a chalcone are more deshielded than the H-a and C-a [9]. However, HMQC experiments of 1 showed correlations of 1H signals at d 8.05 and 7.72 to the 13C signals at d 126.5 and 142.3, respectively, indicating apparent anomalies. The signal (d 6.86) assigned to H-2 and H-6 showed one-bond correlation with the 13C signals at d 105.3. The methine proton at d 7.72 showed cross peaks with the C-2/C-6 signal at d 105.3 ('_J_), so permitting the assignment of the signal at d 7.72 to H-b.

Compound 2 gave spectral data in agreement with those published [6] for the 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone which has previously been isolated from _Merrilla caloxylon_ (Citroideae). However, the 13C NMR data for 2 are reported here for the first time (Table 3). Compound 1 and 6 were used as a model. HMQC and HMDC (Table 2) experiments with 2 permitted the assignment of the signal at d 7.71 to H-b, as in 1, and suggested that the highly

oxygenated B-ring may have caused a upfield shift for H-_b_.

Compound **3** was isolated with a trace of 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanone (**4**), previously isolated from _N. alba_[3]. The mixture was analysed by GC-mass spectrometry, which established that the flavanones were **4** and **3**. The presence of fragment ion at _m_/_z_ 194 (100%) in the mass spectrum for **3**, associated with retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of C-ring, clearly indicated the presence of three methoxyls in the B-ring. Thus, a singlet at \(d\) 6.68 in the 'H NMR spectrum (Table 1) was assigned to H-2' and H-6', requiring the presence of methoxyls at C-3', C-4' and C-5'. The fragment ion at _m_/_z_ 211, also associated with retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of C-ring, suggested that the A-ring carried three methoxyls. Therefore, three isomers are possible for this compound. The correct one was decided on the basis of 13C NMR spectrum (Table 3) which showed signals for three methoxyl groups attached to _ortho_-disubstituted carbon (_d_ 60.9, 61.4 and 61.7). This implies that the methoxyls in the A-ring is located at C-5, C-6 and C-7, since the 'H signal at \(d\) 6.38 (1H) for unsubstituted methine indicate that this proton must not be vicinal to C=O (C-4). A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5,7,8-trimethoxyflavanone (_d_ 89.5, C-6) 5,7,8-(_d_ 93.7, C-6) and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones (_d_ 96.7, C-8) indicated that C-8 methine resonance at lowerfield than C-6 methine [9]. Based on this evidence, the 13C signal at \(d\) 96.4 for C-8 supported the above proposed. The structure of the new natural product is therefore 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavanone (**3**).

Compound **5** gave spectral data in agreement with those published [7] for the 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone which has previously been isolated from _Murraya paniculata_ (Citroideae). However, the assignments of 13C resonances for **5** are reported here for the first time (Table 3). Compound **3** and 5,6,7,2',3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavone (**8**) [9] were used as a models.

These results do not seem to support the affiliation of _Neoraputia_ to the Cusparieae [4]. However, many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae, and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds present in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far.

## Experimental

_General._ NMR: on a Bruker ARX 400, with TMS as int. standard; GC-MS: low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument; IR (KBr, BOMEM-FiIR); UV (Perkin-Flmer).

_Plant material. Neoraputia magnifica_ var. _magnifica_ was collected in Espirito Santo, Brazil, and a voucher (SPF 81-316) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas-USP-Sao Paulo.

_Isolation of compounds._ Ground stems (850 g) was extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and finally with MeOH. The conc. hexane extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient to give a mixt. of fatty acids followed by 3 frs. Fr. containing **1** and a mixt. of sterols was then flashochromatographed as above and then by prep. TLC (silica gel, CH2Cl2-MeOH, 99:1) to yield 0.7 mg of pure **1** and a mixt. of sterols (2 mg). This mixt. was analysed by GC-MS, which established that the sterols were stiosured and stis-masterol. Fr. 2 was purified by prep. TLC as above to give **2** (9 mg). Fr. 3 was subjected to reverse-phase chromatography on silanized silica gel with a gradient mixt. of H2O-MeOH providing 10 frs. Fr. 4 was flash rechromatographed over silica gel using a hexane-EtOAc gradient, to give the following compounds: **3** (1.2 mg; with trace of **4**), **4** (1 mg) and **5** (1.5 mg).
