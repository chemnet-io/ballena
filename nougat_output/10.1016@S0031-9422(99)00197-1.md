###### Abstract

Three new prenylated flavones were isolated from the aerial parts of _Neoraputia paraensis_. On the basis of spectral data these flavones were identified as 5,7,5'-trimethoxy-6-(3'-hydroxy,3'-methyl-_trans_-but-1'-enyl)-3',4'-methylenedioxy-flavone; 5,4'-dihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxy-6-7-(2',2'-dimethylpyran)flavone and 5,4'-dihydroxy-8,3',5'-trimethoxy-6,7-(2',2'-dimethylpyran)-flavone.

## 1 Introduction

The genus _Neoraputia_ (Rutaceae), containing six species, was described in 1978 by Emmerich during the study of the tribe Cuspariaeae (Emmerich, 1978). Some species previously described in _Raputia_, like _R. paraensis_ and _R. alba_, were moved to the new created genus _Neoraputia_. The species _Neoraputia alba_ was chemically investigated and ten flavones and one flavanone were reported (Arruda, Vieira, Fernandes & Silva, 1993; Arruda et al., 1991). The main structural features of these flavonoids were the highly methoxylated substitution pattern and the presence in some structures of a 2,2-dimethylpyran moiety attached to the A-ring of the flavone skeleton. In a previous paper (Souza, Arruda & Arruda, 1995), we reported the isolation of seven flavones from _Neoraputia paraensis_, six highly methoxylated flavones and one pyranoflavone. In a continuation of our chemical investigation on this species, we now report the isolation and structural determination of three new prenylated flavones (1-3).

## 2 Results and discussion

Stems and leaves of _N. paraensis_ were percolated separately with hexane and dichloromethane, successively. The dichloromethane extract of leaves, when submitted to chromatography on silica gel columns, afforded compounds **1** and **2**. The dichloromethane extract of stems, using similar techniques, furnished compound **3**. These compounds (1-3) were identified as flavones mainly via the characteristic \({}^{13}\)C NMR signals of C-2, C-3 and C-4 (Table 1) (Markham & Chari, 1982), together with their UV spectra (see Experimental) (Markham & Mabry, 1982). Unlike **1**, compounds **2** and **3** have hydroxyl groups at C-5 positions (\(\delta_{\rm H}\) 13.05 and 12.75, respectively) supported by the lower field signals of carbon C-4 (\(\delta_{\rm C}\) 182.4 and 183.8, respectively).

Compound **1** was isolated as a colorless solid with a molecular ion peak at \(m/z\) 440 (EIMS) corresponding to the formula C\({}_{24}\)H\({}_{24}\)O\({}_{8}\). The \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at \(\delta_{\rm H}\) 6.74 and 6.84 (1H each, \(J=16.4\) Hz) and a singlet at \(\delta_{\rm H}\) 1.41 (6H, a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups) which is consistent with a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-_trans_-but-1-enyl moiety (Khalid & Waterman, 1981). The mass spectral fragments at \(m/z\) 381 \(\left[{\rm M-C}_{3}{\rm H}_{7}{\rm O}\right]^{+}\) and 59 \(\left[{\rm C}_{3}{\rm H}_{7}{\rm O}\right]^{+}\)

confirmed this group. Further examination of the \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of one methylenedioxy group [\(\delta_{\rm H}\) 6.07 (_s_, 2H)], three methoxys [\(\delta_{\rm H}\) 3.83, 3.97 and 4.00 (_s_, 3H each)] and an AB coupling system [\(\delta_{\rm H}\) 7.07 and 7.11 (_J_ = 1.3 Hz)]. The AB coupling system and fragment ion at _m_/_z_ 176 (**4**), produced by C-ring RDA fission, indicated that the B-ring was substituted at 3', 4' and 5' positions with a methylenedioxy and methoxyl group. The absence of a [M-15]\({}^{+}\) peak in the mass spectrum suggested that there was no methoxyl group attached to C-6 or C-8 on the A-ring (Mabry & Markham, 1975). Moreover, the signals observed at \(\delta_{\rm C}\) 96.8 and \(\delta_{\rm H}\) 6.80 are typical of a non-substituted C-8 A-ring (Markham & Chari, 1982; Markham & Mabry, 1982), therefore the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-_trans_-but-1-enyl substituent was assigned to C-6 and the remaining methoxyls at C-5 and C-7. This was confirmed by the presence of a methoxyl signal at \(\delta_{\rm C}\) 61.1 (OMe-5), which is characteristic of an _ortho_-disubstituted methoxyl group (Panichpol & Waterman,

1978). Finally, the \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectral data supported the proposed structure by comparison with values for related compounds **6** and **7** (Khalid & Waterman, 1981; Arruda et al., 1993). From these spectral data, **1** was identified as 5,7,5'-trimethoxy-6-(3'-hydroxy,3'-methyl-_trans_-but-1"-enyl)-3',4'-methylenedioxy-flavone.

NMR, UV and EIMS data of compounds **2** and **3**, obtained as yellow prisms and yellow pellets respectively, suggested very similar structures, with compound **3** having an additional methoxyl group \(\{\)[M]\({}^{+}\)\(m/z\) 396 (**2**) and 426 (**3**). UV showed bands at \(\lambda_{\rm max}\) 359 nm (**2**) and 357 nm (**3**), typical of flavones, the bathochromic shifts (54 and 55 nm, respectively) induced by 2 M NaOH solution, indicating a 4'-OH (Mabry, Markham & Thomas, 1970). The symmetrical B-ring system for both compounds, with methoxyl groups at C-3' and C-5' \(\{\delta_{\rm H}\) 4.00 (\(s\), 6H) for **2** and 3.99 (\(s\), 6H) for **3**\(\}\), was confirmed by the \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectra showing a 2H singlet peak at \(\delta_{\rm H}\) 7.09 (**2**) and 7.19 (**3**) which corresponded to the H-2'/6'. This was supported by the C-ring RDA fragment ion at \(m/z\) 178 (**5**) in its mass spectrum. The presence of a 2,2-dimethylpyran ring was deduced from the 6H singlet at \(\delta_{\rm H}\) 1.47 (**2**) and 1.60 (**3**) due to the _gem_-dimethyl group and two doublets (\(J=10.0\) Hz) at \(\delta_{\rm H}\) 5.62 and 6.71 for (**2**) and 5.64 and 6.74 for (**3**), corresponding to the two _cis_-coupled olefinic protons. The 2,2-dimethylpyran ring at 6- and 7-positions on A-ring was deduced on the basis of \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectra of the diacetylated derivatives **2a** and **3a** which exhibited upfield shift for H-4" (0.21 and 0.23 ppm, respectively) and downfield shift for H-3" (0.15 and 0.16 ppm, respectively). The acetylation of the 5-OH group is observed to cause a marked diamagnetic shift (\(\Delta\delta_{\rm acetyl}\) = + 0.25 to + 0.4) of the _peri_-H (H-4') and a small paramagnetic shift (\(\Delta\delta_{\rm acetyl}\) = -0.1 to -0.15) of H-3", attributed to steric effects, while the acetylation of an angular system (2,2-dimethylpyran ring at 7- and 8-positions) does not show any appreciable effect on H-4" (Arnone, Cardillo, Merlini & Mondelli, 1967). Therefore, the remaining signals in the \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum of **2**\(\delta_{\rm H}\) 6.54 and 6.44 (\(s\), 1H each) were attributed to H-3 and H-8, respectively. The absence of a singlet around \(\delta_{\rm H}\) 6.4 in the \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum of **3** was indicative of the presence of a methoxyl group [\(\delta_{\rm H}\) 3.95 (\(s\), 3H) and \(\delta_{\rm C}\) 62.1] at C-8. The \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectral data for **2** and **3** were assigned by comparison with data from literature (**8**-**10**) (Agrawal & Rastogi, 1981; Arruda et al., 1993). From the above data, the structures **2** and **3** were characterized as 5,4'-dihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxy-6,7-(2",2"-dimethylpyran)flavone and 5,4'-dihydroxy-8,3',5'-trimethoxy-6,7-(2",2"-dimethylpyran)flavone, respectively.
