###### Abstract

_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a familiar Brazilian species popularly known as Taruma whose leaf tea has been used by population to treat kidney diseases. The aim of this research was to investigate the hydroalcoholic extract of leaves in order to isolate the active compounds. Hydroalcoholic extract of leaves was obtained by stirring the previous hexane and methanol extracted leaves residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing. The obtained extract was partitioned with _n_-butanol. The yielded fraction was subsequently submitted to several chromatographic procedures to lead to the isolation of _O_-glycosidicflavones orientin and isoorientin as well as _C_-glycosylflavones schafoside and carlinoside along with their isomers, known as potent anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antioxidant agents, then identified as the active constituents, justifying the folk use of the plant to combat and prevent kidney stone and inflammation.

## 1 Plant

_Vitex polygamma_ Cham. (Lamiaceae, according to Cantino et al., 1992; formerly Verbenaceae, in keeping with Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the States of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957). The plant was collected in July 2000, in the city of Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and authenticated by Dr. Fatima Regina Salimena-Pires, a taxonomic botanist from Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras da Universidade de Sao Paulo, _campus_ Ribeirao Preto (SPFR), Brazil, under the acquisition number 9968.

## 2 Use in traditional medicine

The leaf tea is used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat and prevent kidney stone and inflammation (Rodrigues, 2001).

## 3 Previously isolated classes of constituents

In preceding studies, _Vitex polygamma_ has been found to contain sesquiterpenes, fatty acids (Barbosa et al., 1995), 2''_O_-caffeoylorientin besides other common flavones simultaneously with some _O_-glycosylated derivatives, flavonols, phenolic acids (Leitao and Delle Monache, 1998), several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the essential oil (Leitao et al., 1999), phytosteroids, caffeoylesters from quinic acid (Santos, 2000), and ecdysteroids (Santos et al., 2001).

## 4 Materials and methods

The powder of the air-dried leaves (423.0 g) was extracted successively with hexane and methanol (MeOH) through percolation process at room temperature. Hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing for 10 min (3\(\times\) 300 mL).

The resulting filtrates were subsequently combined, evaporated _in vacuum_ (40 degC) and lyophilized. Afterward, the extract (31 g, 31%, w/w of the dry leaves weight (DLW)) was dissolved in distilled water and fractionated through liquid-liquid partition using ethyl acetate (EA) and _n_-BuOH (BU) (5\(\times\) 300 mL each) to yield EA (2.2 g, 2.2%, w/w DLW) and BU (10.7 g, 10.7%, w/w DLW) fractions, respectively. BU fraction was subjected to CC using XAD7 (46.0 cm x 4.0 cm) and subsequent elution with 500 mL of water (WV), water/MeOH 1:1 (WMV) and 2 L of MeOH (MV). One gram of the dried fraction MV (6.75 g, 6.75%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (53.0 cm x 3.0 cm) using MeOH as eluent resulting in 41 fractions of 30 mL, which were pooled into seven fractions (MV1 to MV7). Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg, 1.13%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with MeOH. Twenty-three fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg, 0.39% w/w DLW) was further purified by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase MeOH, flow-rate 3 mL min\({}^{-1}\); \(\lambda\) 330 nm) to yield compounds **1** and **2** (5.5 mg, 0.04%, w/w DLW), substances **3** and **4** (3.1 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) after three cycles of 54 min. Fraction 5 (MV5, 293.1 mg, 1.98%, w/w DLW) was submitted to the same R-HPLC system to yield compounds **5** and **6** (20.5 mg, 0.14%, w/w DLW) as mixture, and compounds **7** and **8** (3.0 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) also as mixture. Fraction WV, after recrystallization in 90% aqueous MeOH solution, afforded substance **9** (280.0 mg).

## Results

From _n_-BuOH partition of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves from _Vitex polygamma_ were isolated the compounds caffeoyl 6-_O_-b-d-glucopyranoside (**1**), caffeoyl 6-_O_-a-d-d-glucopyranoside (**2**), schafoside (**3**), isoschafoside (**4**), orientin (**5**), isoorientin (**6**), carlinoside (**7**), isocarlinoside (**8**) and metacrylic acid (**9**) whose chemical structures (Fig. 1) were identified by means of \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR as well as HMBC, HSQC and negative ESI/MS spectra data which were in accordance with previously reported data (Kitagawa, 1984; Besson et al., 1985; Dayrit et al., 1987; Shimomura et al., 1988). Schafoside and its isomer is known for its efficacy as anti-inflammatory (Melo et al., 2005) and preventive effect against kidney stone in rats, as evaluated by urine output, excretion of Ca, citric acid, and creatinine analysis (Kubo et al., 1989). Moreover the _C_-glycosidic flavones **3**, **4**, **7** and **8** are being reported for the first time in the genus _Vitex_.
