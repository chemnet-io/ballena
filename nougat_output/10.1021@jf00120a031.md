**Pyrolysis products of babassu (_Orbignya martiana_), piqui (_Caryocar coriaceum_), and palm oils (_Elaeis guinenesis_) were analyzed by GC/MS using library search programs. The chief products of pyrolysis were straight-chain alkanes and 1-alkenes. Small amounts of cyclic hydrocarbons were detected in triglycerides constituted by oleic acid as the major moiety. Pyrolysis of oleic acid was also studied. A pathway for the cracking reactions involved with the decomposition of the saturated fatty acids is proposed.**

Edible oils are essential for the human diet and therefore their use for other purposes has thus far not received much attention. However, during and after World War II several studies on the pyrolysis of vegetable oils were carried out for using the products thus obtained as fuel (Otto, 1945; Chang and Wan, 1947; Hsu et al., 1950). The studies concerning the chemical composition of the volatile compounds produced were not complete due to instrumental limitation and the analytical methods thus used (Hsu et al., 1950). Reports on the thermal cracking of bechine acid by Jung and Elsma (1964) showed that \(C_{\text{g}}\)-\(C_{\text{s}}\) hydrocarbons were chiefly produced when bechine was used as the catalyst. However, Traitler and Kratzl (1980) obtained _n_-alkylbenzenes from pyrolysis of fatty acids using lignin as the catalyst. Craveiro et al. (1981a,b) obtained long-chain methyl ketones when babassu oil was pyrolyzed in the presence of CaO.

On the basis of these studies it is clear that the pyrolysis products from fatty acids or glycerides are highly dependent on the nature and amount of catalyst used. For this reason we decided to investigate cracking reactions, carried out in the absence of catalyst, of three vegetable oils extracted from native or acclimated plants largely dispersed in northern and northeastern Brazil: _Orbynya martiana_ (babassu), _Caryocar coriaceum_ (piqui), and _Elaeis guinenesis_ (palm).

**EXPERIMENTAL SECTION**

**Samples.** Crude oil samples of babassu and piqui oils were obtained from industries in the state of Ceara, and the palm oil was a commercial sample originated from Bahia State.

**Pyrolysis.** Cracking reactions were carried out at 300-500 degC (atomospheric pressure) in a glass apparatus with internal and external temperatures being measured by a thermometer and pyrometer. The percent yields of volatiles so obtained were in the range 60-80 (v/v). Hydrogenation reactions were carried out on a Part hydrogenation apparatus at 60-70 psi by using Pt as the catalyst over a period of 3 h. CO2 evolution was detected as CaCO2.

**Gas Chromatography and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry.** Analytical chromatograms were obtained on a FID Varian instrument equipped with fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.20 nm i.d.) by using methyl silicone as the stationary phase, N2 as the carrier gas (1 mL/min) at 40-250 degC, and 4 degC/min programmed temperature conditions. The separation and analysis of the cracked samples were made on a HP 5995 mass spectrometer coupled to GC equipped with a glass open tubular column (SP 2100, 30 m x 0.25 nm i.d.) using He as the carrier gas (1 mL/min) and the temperature programmed as above. Chromatographic retention times and peak areas were used to calculate Kovar's indexes and compound percentages, respectively.

**Compound Identifications.** Compound identifications involved library search programs (Craveiro et al., 1981a,b) and visual comparison with published mass spectra (Stenhagen et al., 1974; Heller and Milne, 1978). Com

pounds with unpublished mass spectra were tentatively identified on the basis of the mass spectra of their homologues along with their calculated Kovat's indexes.

**Computer Programs.** Computer programs for calculation of Kovat's indexes and mass spectra comparisons were either developed in our laboratory or were derived for HP 9825A calculator software.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The fatty acid content of babassu and palm oils are well-known (Costa, 1967; Heiduschka and Agsten, 1930). The composition presented in Table 1 for these oils as well as for piqui oil was derived from GC/MS analysis (as Me esters) carried out in our laboratory. Pyrolysis of the crude oils were performed in a Pyrex apparatus and was accompanied by the evolution of gas due to decarboxylation reactions. This afforded a mixture of _n_-alkanes and 1-alkenes as the major products (94.46% for babassu, 68.20% for piqui, for 95.55% for palm oils; see Table 2). Noteworthy differences in the cracking patterns (Table 2) seem to be associated with the unsaturated fatty acid content (mainly oleic acid) in the original oils, which is likely to generate more volatile molecules than their saturated counterparts. Furthermore, it is possible to make an association between the major saturated fatty acid present in the original oil and the chief saturated hydrocarbon in the pyrolysis product, the latter being generated by decarboxylation of the former.

Triglycerides constituted by oleic acid as the major moiety produced in addition to straight-chain hydrocarbons cyclopearaffins and cycloolefins in small amounts. The formation of these cyclic hydrocarbons may be probably related to cyclizations in which the 9-10 double bond of oleic acid plays an important role.

The absence of oxygenated compounds among the volatiles identified in Table 2 suggests that the elimination of CO2 and CH2-CO were dominant steps in the cracking reactions of triglycerides and fatty acids, at least in the absence of catalyst.

The formation of a complete series of _n_-alkanes and 1-alkenes (Table 2) is consistent with the generation of the radicals RCOO- (A) and RCH2CO- (B) from the triglyceride molecule (Figure 1). Radical A on decarboxylation would led to the formation of R. This radical, on disproportionation and successive eliminations of ethylene molecules, would be responsible for the odd series of _n_-alkanes and 1-alkenes present in the mixture. Radical B, by loss of ketene (CH2-CO), disproportionation, and successive eliminations of ethylene molecules, would generate the _n_-alkanes and 1-alkenes with an even number of carbon atoms.

A scheme showing the probable decomposition pathway of saturated moieties of triglycerides during cracking reactions is depicted in Figure 1 and was based on pyrolysis mechanisms originally proposed by Chang and Wan (1947) and Greensfelder et al. (1949).

The presence of alkylcyclopentanes and alkylcyclohexanes in the pyrolysis of oils with high oleic acid content indicates that ring formation may occur with the assistance of the double bond through a mechanism similar to that proposed in Figure 1.

The high potential of one of these palms as renewable resource of energy is illustrated in Chart I, which is an overview of the major products obtained from babassu nut; this palm tree grows wild throughout more than 35 million acres in the Brazilian northeastern states.
