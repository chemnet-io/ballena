# Abstract

A phytochemicaln phytochemicaln'hypothylamine is a monospecific genus, and the species Raulinoa echinata Cowan (Rutaceae) is endemic to the [tlajil'Valley, Santa Catarina, Brazil.1 This perennial woody shrub is characterized by the presence of spines and has been found only in a restricted location (1000 m) on the frequently inundated banks of the tlajai River at an approximate altitude of 100 m, showing a high degree of adaptation to the environment. In continuation of our research on the chemistry of Raulino echinata,2,3 investigation of methanol extracts of stems and leaves has led to the isolation of the new 21a,25-dimethylmelanediol (1) and 21b,25-dimethylmelanediol (2) and also three new N-methylanthranilic acid esters of the gaharel-type compounds 3-5. In this work, the isolated compounds were also assayed in vitro against trypanosamiazyna (2002).

The hexane extract of the stems of R. echinata yielded the tritterpens melianone and melanediol, which exhibited spectral data in agreement with the literature.4,5 The hemiaetal ring of these compounds opens and doses in solution; thus, a mixture of epilmers is always present.

From the methanol extract compounds of R. echinata stems 1 and 2 were obtained. As shown previously for melananone and melanediol, these compounds exhibited resonances in their 1H NMR spectra at ca. \(b\) 5.30 (brd, J = 3.0), ascribable to H-7, and seven singlets for quaternary methyl groups between \(d\) 0.82 and 1.25. Resonances at \(d\) 216.7, 145.6/145.3, and 118.1/118.0 were assigned to C-3, C-8, and C-7, respectively, in the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 2. In contrast to melananediol, two methoxy group signals were observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2. The side chain in each case was found to be the 21, 25-dimethyl analogue of melanediol, as verified by heteronuclear correlations of the methoxy groups with C-21 and C-25 in the HMBC spectra of 1 and 2. The HSQC spectra of compounds 1 and 2 showed correlations of the C-21 group resonances at \(d\) 109.7 and 104.7 with H-21 [at \(d\) 4.79 and 4.468 d (J = 3.4 Hz) for 1 and 2, respectively], characterizing them as C-21 primers. The H-23 [4.16 odd (J = 7.3, 5.4, 2.9 Hz)] and C-23 (_d_ 75.1) resonances, in addition to the H-24 (3.37 brd) and C-24 (_d_ 76.4) signals, showed correlations in the HSQC spectrum of compound 1. The isomer 2 showed the same correlations but inverted chemical shifts for C-23 (_d_ 77.8) and C-24 (_d_ 76.7).

Additional information was obtained by HMBC and NOE difference NMR experiments. In the HMBC spectra, correlations for C-25 (_d_ 77.2) and H-26/27 (_d_ 1.15 and 1.25) for compound 1, and at \(d\) 77.7 with 1.18 and 1.25 for compound 2, were observed. The H-18 (_d_ 0.82) signal in the HMBC spectrum of compound 1 correlated with C-21 (_d_ 31.1), C-13 (_d_ 43.6), C-14 (_d_ 51.0), and C-17 (_d_ 50.7). For compound 2, H-18 showed the same correlations, but the chemical shift of C-17 was upfield (_d_ 44.9). This differ one was attributed to a _y_-gauche effect of the oxygenated substituent on C-21b. Nakanishi et al.5 performed the X-ray crystallographic analysis of a melianone acetate analogue, comparing chemical shifts of _a_- and _b_-melanone acetates. According to their findings, C-21 exhibited downfield shifts and C-23 showed upfield shifts, in the C-21a either. These arguments were confirmed by NOE difference experiments for 1 and 2 (Table 3). In compound 1, irradiation of the

OMe-21 resonance at \(\delta\) 3.34 gave an enhancement of the H-23 signal at \(\delta\) 4.16. This enhancement was not observed for OMe-21 of compound 2. Accordingly, the structures of 1 and 2 were assigned as 21a,25-dimethylmalanoidl-[(21R,23R)epoxy-24-hydroxy-21a,25-methoxylirucalla-7-en-3-one and 21b,25-dimethylmalanoidl[(21S,23R)epoxy-24-hydroxy-21b,25-dimethoxylirucalla-7-en-3-one, respectively.

Compound 3 exhibited a pair of doublets (one hydrogen each), at \(\delta\) 0.49 (J = 5.0 Hz) and 0.74 (J = 5.0 Hz), in the COSY NMR spectrum. In the HSQC NMR spectrum, these hydrogens correlated with a methylene carbon at \(\delta\) 13.4, indicating a 14,18-cydopaopunga skeleton. The side chain of compound 3 was assigned as a methyl melanoidl-type unit, as evidenced by resonances in the 'H NMR spectrum at 4.84 [(d, J = 3.0 Hz), H-21], 4.04 [(d, J = 10.2, 4.8, 2.0 Hz), H-23], 3.51 [(d, J = 5.0 Hz), H-24], and 3.36 s (OMe-21).6 The H-21 signal correlated in the HSQC spectrum with C-21 at \(\delta\) 108.5, suggesting a C-21a-methoxy carbon, as in the case of 1.1 in the HMDC spectrum, H-21 correlated with C-23 (\(\delta\) 77.6) and C-20 (\(\delta\) 49.5), while H-23 and H-24 correlated in the HSQC spectrum with oxymethine carbons at 0 77.6 and 77.9, respectively. A broad singlet at \(\delta\) 3.76 indicated a H-7b substituent,6 correlating in the HSQC spectrum with a carbon at \(\delta\) 74.1. In the HMDC spectrum, the H-7b signal correlated with methylene carbons at \(\delta\) 43.8 (C-9) and 46.1 (C-5). The former showed correlations with singlets attributed to H-30 (\(\delta\) 1.03) and H-19 (\(\delta\) 0.93); the latter correlated with H-28 and H-29 (\(\delta\) 1.00/0.92), respectively. The HREIMS of compounds 3\(-\)5 revealed an odd molecular weight, in each case indicating the presence of nitrogen in these molecules. A 3_j_/N-methylanthranilate group was indicated in the 'H NMR spectra of compounds 3\(-\)5 by the resonances at \(\delta\) 4.70 (dd, J = 11.1 and 5.0 Hz for 3 and 4; J = 10.3 and 5.8 Hz for 5) corresponding to H-3a, which correlated in their HSQC spectra with an oxymethine carbon (\(\delta\) 80.4 +- 0.1). Compound 3 exhibited aromatic signals at \(\delta\) 7.90 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.6 Hz), 7.31 (dd, J = 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz), 6.65 (brd, J = 8.0 Hz), and 6.58 (ddd, J = 8.0, 7.0, 1.6 Hz). In addition, doublets at \(\delta\) 7.70 (br, J = 4.6 Hz, N-H) and 2.90 (J = 4.6 Hz, N-Me) were observed in the COSY spectra, consistent with a N-methylanthranilic acid ester. Similar features were observed for compounds 4 and 5 (Table 1).

The N-Me hydrogens correlated in the HMBC spectra of 3 with the quaternary carbon at \(\delta\) 152.0 (C-3 ), which showed correlations with the signals at \(\delta\) 7.90 (H-7 ) and 7.31 (H-5 ). The carbonyl C-1 (\(\delta\) 168.2) correlated with H-7 (\(\delta\) 131.3). In the COSY spectrum coupling between H-7 /H-6 and H-5 /H-4 was observed. Accordingly, compound 3 was assigned as (21R,23S)-epoxy-21a-methoxy-7a,24,25-trihydr oxy-4a,4b,8b,10b/tetramethyl-25-dimethyl-14,18-cy-d-5a,13a,14a,17a-cholestera-3b/N-methylanthranilic acid ester.

Compound 4 differed from compound 3 only in the configuration of C-21, with chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra observed for the hydrogens of the side chain along with upfield changes for carbons C-21, C-17, and C-16, in agreement with a \(\beta\)-configuration, as discussed earlier for 2. Compound 4 was assigned the structure (21R,23S)-epoxy-21a-methoxy-7a,24,25-trihydroxy-4a,4b,8b,10b/tetramethy1-25-dimethyl-14,18-cyd-5a,13a,14a,17a-cholestera-3b/N-methylanthranilic acid ester.

Compound 5 was also assigned an N-methylanthranilic acid ester with a 14,18-cyd-oaqueounhane skeleton, but did not exhibit a methoxyl singlet in the 'H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance was observed downfield (\(\delta\) 5.28) when compared to the methoxylated derivatives 3 and 4. Additionally, the signals for the side chain of compound 5 were duplicated in the 'H NMR spectrum. The H-21 resonance showed a second doublet (of minor intensity) at \(\delta\) 5.32, multiplets at \(\delta\) 4.40 and 4.23 attributed to H-23, and doublets at \(\delta\) 3.58 and 3.13 assigned to H-24. These observations strongly suggested that 5 is a C-21 hydroxyl derivative, isolated as an epimeric mixture,6,7 As for compounds 1-4, compound 5 was finally elucidated by a series of 2D NMR experiments, including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. NMR spectral data for compounds 1-5 are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the main H-C correlations in the long-range HMBC spectrum of 5. Thus, the structure of 5 was assigned as (21,23S)-epoxy-7a,21,-24,25-tetrahydroxy-4a,4b,8b,10b/tetramethy1-25-dimethyl-14,18-cyd-5a,13a,14a,17a-cholestera-3b/N-methylanthranilic acid ester.

Half of the MeOH extract of the leaves (100 g) was submitted to liquid partition with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The hexane (15 g) and CH4Cl2 fractions (10 g) obtained were chromatographed over silica gel (70-230 mesh) using solvents of increasing polarity: hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. A fraction eluted by CH2Cl2 (1.7 g) from the hexane fraction yielded compounds 4 (39 mg) and 5 (44 mg) using column chromatography over silica gel (230-400 mesh) and hexane-acetone (9:1) for elution. The EtOAc (1.5 g) fraction from the CH2Cl2 fraction yielded compound 3 (50 mg) with the same solvent mixture above.
