along with the definite protons in a trans arrangement at \(d\) 7.23 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz, H-7 ) and 5.93 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz, H-8 ). In addition, the 'H NMR spectrum also displayed singlets at \(d\) 7.22, 6.61, and 6.15, which showed correlation with signals at \(d\) 109.1, 103.4, and 95.0, respectively, in the HMQC spectrum. These data, analyzed with their corresponding 13C NMR data (Table 2), and further information from ESI-MS/MS (m/z 405), and analogues published in the literature,10 suggested a xanthone skeleton linked to a caffeoyl-glucose moiety for compound 1. TOCSY experiments showed a complete sequence of five correlated signals of the sugar moiety at \(d\) 3.4-3.9. In addition a doublet at \(d\) 5.01 (J = 10.0 Hz) and one multiplet at \(d\) 5.58 were assigned to H-1 and H-2, respectively, on the basis of COSY, 13C NMR, and HMQC spectral analysis. The unusual downfield chemical shift of the H-2 signal suggested an acyl moiety at C-2,12 which was corroborated by the values from C-1, C-2, and C-3 (Table 2) and observation of a cross-peak between the H-2 and C-9 (_d_ 168.3) signals in the HMBC spectrum. Additional correlations between H-1 (_d_ 5.01) and C-1 (_d_ 162.8), C-2 (_d_ 106.0), and C-3 (_d_ 165.0) evidenced the linkage of the glucose moiety at C-2. This spectrum also showed correlations of the signals at \(d\) 6.15 (H-4) to C-2 (_d_ 106.0), C-3 (_d_ 165.0), C-4a (_d_ 158.8), and C-9a (_d_ 102.9); \(d\) 6.61 (H-5) to C-10a (_d_ 153.0), C-6 (_d_ 155.3), C-7 (_d_ 144.8), and C-8a (_d_ 113.6), and \(d\) 7.22 (H-8) to C-10a (_d_ 153.0), C-6 (_d_ 155.3), C-7 (_d_ 144.8), C-9a (_d_ 102.9), and C-9 (_d_ 181.1), supporting the substitution pattern proposed for the glycone. The UV spectra record in MeOH and shift reagents (AlCl3, HCl, KOH, NaOAc, and H3BO3) confirmed the presence of free hydr oxy groups at C-1 and C-3 and an ortho-dihydroxylation pattern for the B ring of compound 1.11 Finally, the positive-ion electrolyte/scorbox tandem mass spectra ESI(+)-MS/MS (Table 3) completely established the proposed structure for 1. The fragment at m/z 585 (a) is rather simple and structurally characteristic, as it shows two major fragment ions of m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), which can be clearly related to the proposed C-glucosylxanthone, as well as the fragment at m/z 163 (d), confirming the caffeoyl moiety for this xanthone.

Compound 2 was assigned the empirical formula C28H23O12, [M - H]- m/z 551.1241, by accurate negative-ion HRESIMS. The UV and IR spectra were nearly identical to those obtained for 1. Direct comparison of 1H data (Table 1) of 1 and 2 showed that the signals for the caffeoyl moiety from 1 were replaced in 2 by a pair of multiplets at \(d\) 7.56 and 7.34. The hydrogens corresponding to the two difenit protons were similar and appeared as doublets with a coupling constant of 15.5 Hz at \(d\) 7.39 (H-7 ) and 6.37 (H-8 ), revealing a cinnamyl moiety with a trans stereochemistry. The remaining 1H NMR of this compound was

The ESI(+)-MS/MS tandem mass spectrum of the protonated ion at m/z 553 (a) was analyzed and also corroborated the proposed structure for this compound (Table 3). It showed two major ion fragments at m/z 405 (b) and 285 (c), which revealed the C-glucosylxanthone backbone, whereas the unique acylium ion fragment at m/z 131 (d) corroborated the dinamonyl group.

methanol, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 \(\mu\)mol. Each mixture was shaken and held for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Rutin was used as a reference compound. DPPH solution (2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as a control. The evaluation of the reduced form of DPPH generated in situ was performed measuring the decrease in the current (1) on the electrochemical cell of the EICD.15 The areas obtained in each chromatogram were normalized and compared with the one obtained for the blank. The radical scavenging activity of the samples was expressed in terms of 1C50 (concentration in \(\mu\)mol required for a 50% decrease in current (1) by the reduced form of DPPH). Rutin was used as reference compound.
