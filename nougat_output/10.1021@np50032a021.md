###### Abstract

As part of our continuing study of the genus _Mochinea_ (Compositae) (1, 2), we are now reporting the isolation and identification of the sesquiterpene lactone dehydrocostus lactone (3) and a previously unknown, naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, bauerenyl acetate (**1**). This phyto-constituent was identical with bauerenol by comparison of the physical and chemical properties of its alkaline hydrolysis product. Subsequent Jones oxidation of our hydrolysis product furnished a ketone identical with bauerenone (4-6).

The cmr chemical shifts of compound **1** were assigned by comparison with models and on the basis of known substituent effects (7-11).

Previously unreported cmr data of **1** are described below.

## 1 Experimental

Plant material.--The trunk and bark of _Mochinea polymorpha_ (Less.) **DC**. (3.0 kg) was collected in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil, December 1979.

Extraction and isolation.--The dry, powdered, plant material (trunk, 1.0 kg) was extracted with hexane to yield a yellow, gummy solid (8.0 g). The crude extract (6.0 g) was chromatographed on Si gel (120 g), and the CHCl3 eluate gave a solid that partly crystallized. This was characterized as dehydrocostus lactone (3).

_Bauerenyl acetate.--Hexane extraction of the bark (500 g) furnished a precipitate (150 g), which after treatment with dry Et2O and successive recrystallizations in CHCl3-hexane (2:8), furnished a crystalline material (0.120 g), mp 290-29deg, l max (EtOH) = 211 nm (e = 500);_

Baurencone.--Bauerenol (20 mg) was oxidized with Jones reagent at room temperature for 15 min to yield a ketone. Recrystallization of the ketone (12 mg) from CHCl3 gave a product which showed it and mass spectra identical with those described in the literature for baurencone (4-6).
