###### Abstract

A novel triterpene, viburgingin (1), has been isolated from an extract of the ripe fruit rinds of Rudgea viburnioides, together with the known saponins, arjunglucoside1 and trachelosperosides B-1 and E-1, and the triterpenes trachelosperogenin B (2) and arjungenin. Compound 2 was previously obtained as a product from enzymatic hydrolysis, and it is reported for the first time as a natural product. The structure of compound 1 was determined as 2a,3b,19a,23,24-pentahydroxyurs-12-ene by extensive use of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic methods. Compound 1 exhibited moderate antifungal activity against Cladosporium dadosporioides.

(Table 1). The \({}^{\rm 1H}\) NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited the presence of an olefinic proton (\(\delta\) 5.58; br s) and six signals [\(\delta\) 4.45 (ddd, J = 4.0, 9.0, 12.0 Hz), 3.66 (d, J = 9.0 Hz), 3.99 and 4.62 (d, J = 11.0 Hz), 4.28 and 4.88 (d, J = 11.0 Hz)] corresponding to hydroxymethylene and hydroxymethylene protons. In addition, the \({}^{\rm 1H}\) NMR spectrum showed signals due to five tertiary methyl groups (\(\delta\) 0.65, 1.02, 1.17, 1.22, and 1.26) and to a secondary methyl group (\(\delta\) 0.92; d, J = 6.0 Hz). These values are quite similar to those observed for the aglyon of tracheoloreside B-1,2,3 a known compound also isolated in this study. The \({}^{\rm 1C}\) NMR (Table 1) spectrum of 1 was almost superimposable with that of 2 (see the Experimental Section), with the only differences concerning the C-17 and C-28 resonances (Table 1). The chemical shifts for these carbons in compound 1 were \(\delta\) 31.9 and 27.3, respectively, which differed significantly from those of compound 3 (\(\delta\) 48.8 and 179.9) due the presence of carboxyl group at C-28.2 Furthermore, the \({}^{\rm 13C}\) NMR spectrum, analyzed with the aid of DEPT and HETCOR spectra, showed the presence of two oxygenated methanes (\(\delta_{\rm C}\) 69.1, 79.8) and methylene (\(\delta_{\rm C}\) 62.9, 64.3). The foregoing suggested the presence of a urs-12-ene triterpene system hydroxylated at C-19. The relative configurations of the chiral carbons at C-2 and C-3 of 1 were assigned mainly on the basis of \({}^{\rm 1H}\) NMR coupling data and comparison with those reported for related triterpenes.2-4 Ursane and oleanane triterpenes and their derived saponins are secondary metabolites encountered frequently in various species in the Rubiaceae.5-7 However, the occurrence of polyoxygenated ursolic and oleanolic triterpene derivatives is being described now for the first time in plants of this family. The known compounds already were reported as the main secondary metabolites of Trachelospermum asiatiatum (Apocynaceae), a traditional Japanese remedy known as \({}^{\rm 7Eika-Kazura}\).2 The presence of these compounds in species of the Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae could disdose possible evolutionary tendencies among these two families, considering the fact that Rubiaceae and Apocynaceae belong to the same morphological group of Gentianales.

Viburgenin (1) showed moderate antifungal activity against C. dadosporidoides in a TLC bioassay.8 The amount of 1 required to inhibit fungal growth on a TLC plate was 50 \(\mu\)g. The inhibitory power displayed by 1 was considered moderate by comparison with the controls, nystatin (5 \(\mu\)g) and miconazole (1 \(\mu\)g).

### Experimental Section

General Experimental Procedures. Optical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in GSpN or CDCl3 on a Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for \({}^{\rm 1H}\) and 100 MHz for \({}^{\rm 13C}\), using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90 and 135deg, respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 TO E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, Si gel 60, 70-230 mesh, Sephadex LH-20 and Diation HP-20, was used. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 and RF-18F254 plates. Spots were visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H2SO4 after heating.

Plant Material. The ripe fruit finds of R. vibrunicides were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guayi, SP, Brazil, by M. C. M. Young in December 1993. A voucher specimen (no. SP-196941) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Bioassay. The experimental method utilized in the bioactivity assay has been described elsewhere.9

Extraction and isolation. Dried and powdered ripe fruit finds (2.0 kg) of R. vibrunicides were extracted with aqueous EtOH (3\(\times\)) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was evaporated in vacuo to give a crude extract (77 g), which was washed with EtOAc several times. The EtOAc-soluble part (2.9 g) was fractionated on silica gel column (120 g) using EtOAc-MeOH gradient cations to give six fractions. Fraction 4 (1.0 g, EtOAc-MeOH 77:15) was further fractionated by silica gel flash chromatography using CHCl3\({}_{\rm 3}\)-MeOH (64:36) and CHCl3\({}_{\rm 3}\)-MeOH -H2O (64:36:8). Altogether, 146 fractions were collected, and fractions 21-32 (240 mg) were fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH\(-\) CHCl3 (9:1) to give 1 (24 mg), tracheoloserogin B (2, 51 mg), and tracheoloserogin C-1 (36 mg). Fractions 95-117 (57 mg) were submitted to chromatography column on Diation HP-20 using MeOH\(-\)H2O (1:1). The combined fractions 7-9 from this column were fractionated further on silica gel (13 g) using CHCl3\({}_{\rm 3}\)-MeOH -H2O (77:15:8) to give tracheoloserogin B (37 mg) and arjungenin (12 mg). The residue (10 g) obtained from washing with EtOAc was extracted with n-BuOH (3\(\times\)) at room temperature. The

n-BuOH extract (2.4 g) was fractionated on Si gel (140 g) using CHCl3-MeOH (64:36) and then increasing the polarity to CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (64:36:8). Fractions 95-106 (382 mg) were further submitted to silica gel flash chromatography (3.5 g) using CHCl3-MeOH-n-PrOH-H2O (9:12:2.8, lower phase) to yield the saponins trachospoxide (30 mg) and arjuyngenin (39 mg).
