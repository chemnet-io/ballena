###### Abstract

The dichloromethane extract of Almeidea coerulea stems yielded the (11-hydroxytutacearpine alkaloid reported for the first time from this species) and the triterpene (28-hydroxy-28, 29-dihydrohleped). The dictamine, skimianine, sitoosterol and stigmasterol were also isolated from methanol extract. Extracellular forms of Leishmania amazonensis (promastigotes) was tested with dichloromethane extract and 28-hydroxy-28, 29-dihydrohleped with showed anti-leishmanial activity above 0.1 mg/mL and 75 mg/mL (inhibited 50% promastigotes growth), respectively.

cruzi_ (Mafezoli et al., 2000). The aim of this work to study the isolation and the structural elucidation of one indolopyridoquinazoline alkaloid (**1**), two fluoroquinoline alkaloids (**2** and **3**), one lupane triterpene **4** and one mixture of steroids (**5** and **6**) and to evaluate the activity of the compound **4** against _Leishmania (L.) amazonensis._

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### General

The NMR spectra were obtained in a BRUKER DRX400 (9.4 T) and VARIAN GEMINI300 (7.05T), using deuterated solvent for field homogeneity, TMS as internal standard and temperature constant of 298K. For gHMBC the coupling constants were optimised for 4, 6, 8 and 12 Hz. IR: film NaCl plates; ESI-MSMS: low resolution on a triple quadrupole were recorded on a Micromass Quattro LC instrument equipped with a "Z-spray"ion source, and EI-MS on a CG/EMSHIMADZU QP 2000 A. CC: silica gel 60 (70-230 and 230-400 mesh); TLC: silica gel plates F254 (0.25 mm in thickness).

### Plant Materials

The aerial parts of _Almeidea coerulea_ (Nees and Mart.) A.St.-Hil. were collected from Itacare, Bahia, Brazil, in February 1993. The specimen was identified by Dr. Jose Pirani from the Department of Botany of the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium specimen (Pirani and Kallunki 2747) deposited in the University of Maringa (Brazil).

### Isolation of Constituents

The dichloromethane extract (8.1 g) and the methanol extract (22.1 g) of the stem the _A. coerulea_ was submitted to vacuum chromatography over an microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel ) support and eluted with n-hexane, n-hexane-CHCl3 (1:1), CHCl3, CHCl3-EtOAc (1:1), EtOAc, and MeOH with gave seven fractions of each extract. The fraction 3 (1,47 g) from dichloromethane extract was chromatographed in silica gel columns using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-Acetone gradient solvents to 156 fractions. The fractions 30 to 47 (239 mg) were rechromatographed in silica gel (230-400 mesh) successively to fractions 26 (17 mg) and 36 (13 mg). The fractions were purified by gel filtration columns on Sephadex LH-20 with MeOH-ChCl3 (1:1) to obtain the compounds **1** (1.8 mg) and **4** (22.3 mg). The fraction 2 (1.14 g) from methanol extract was chromatographed in silica gel columns using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-Acetone gradient solvents to obtain the compounds **3** (3mg) and mixture **5** and **6** (3 mg). The fractions 21 to 25 was chromatographed in gel filtration columns on Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH-CHCl3 (1:1) to the fraction 34 and was purified by silica gel column, hexane-acetone (17:3) to obtain the compound **2** (3.8 mg).

### Culture and Maintenance of the Parasites

The promastigotes forms of _Leishmania (L.) amazonensis_ strain MHOM/BR73/M2269 were cultured and tested in the 199 medium (Gibco, BRL) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Cultilab, Brazil), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL) (Sigma) at 25 degC. They were then used in the exponential phase of growth (day 4 of culture).

The compound **4** was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted in the 199 medium. The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.05%. For promastigotes drug susceptibility determinations, the parasites were placed in each test well of a 24-well micro culture plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 1x105promastigotes/mL of culture medium and incubated in triplicates with various concentration of alkaloids 9 at 25degC for 24, 48, 72 and 96h. The compound **4** was only added at the beginning of the cultivation. Controls cultures were incubated with the same dilution of DMSO or pentamidine istionate (0.7 mg/mL).

Promastigotes were counted using a hemocytometer, after it was passed five times through a 25-gauge needle in order to have separate clumps.

It appeared at 9.51 (\(s\)) and hydroxyl group at 11.54 (\(s\)). The nine carbon signals bearing protons were determined by gHSQC experiment, which establishes one bond correlations (Table 1). The remaining eight quaternary carbon signals were assigned based on long range H/C correlations from a \({}^{1}\)H-\({}^{13}\)CgHMBC experiment and by comparison with rutaecarpine spectroscopic data[1]. Further analyses of HMBC correlations between the methylene protons at 4.40, \(t\) (\(J=6.9\) Hz, H-7) and and the two quaternary carbons at 119.1 (C-8a) and 125.7 (C-9a) indicated that the junction of partial structures was C-8 C-8a and C-14a C-13a.

The HMBC correlation between the aromatic proton at 7.12, _dd_ (\(J\) = 8.1,1.2 Hz, H-4) and carbonyl carbon at 161.1 (C-5) confirmed that the junction of partial structures should be C-5

C-4a and H-14 C14a. The correlation of aromatics protons at methylene 7.43, \(d\) (\(J\) = 8.7 Hz, H-9), 6.61, \(d\) (\(J\) = 8.7 Hz, H-10) and 6.82, \(d\) (\(J\) = 1.8 Hz, H-12) and aromatic carbon 125.7 (C-9a), 97.1 (C-12) and 140.8 (C-12a) respectively confirmed the position of hydroxyl group at C-11. Based on the above evidence, the structure of 1 was established as 11-hydroxyrutaecarpine.
