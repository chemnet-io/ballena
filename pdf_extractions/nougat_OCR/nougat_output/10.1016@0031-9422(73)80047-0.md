3012, 2941, 1640, 1075 and 830 cm-1. _Acetate._ C32H52O2 needles from acetone, m.p. 218, [a]D +47:3deg (_c_ 2:0, CHCl3). _Benzoate._ C37H54O2, prisms from acetone, m.p. 273deg, \(c\) [a]D +60:5deg (_c_ 4:0, CHCl3). The identity of the compound as lupeol was confirmed by m.m.p., IR and MS of the acetate. The CHCl3 solution, after the removal of lupeol, was concentrated to a small volume and chromatographed on alumina to give a compound which crystallized from EtOH to give needles, C30H50O2, m.p. 248-250deg (Found : C, 81:37; H, 11:39. Cal. for C30H50O2; C, 81:39; H, 11:38%). IR (Nujol) \(v\) 3450, 1665, 1625 and 1057 cm-1. Acetate (di): C34H54O4, prisms from EtOH, m.p. 223deg, which had superimposable IR, NMR and MS with that of an authentic sample of betulin diacetate.

_Trunk-wood_ (1:4 kg) collected at km-14 of the Manaus Itacoatiara road was extracted with benzene at room temp. The extract (40 g) was chromatographed on silica. Elution with light petrol. gave safrol (12 ml). Elution with light petrol.-benzene, 1:1 gave first sitosterol (350 mg) and next eugenol (8 ml). Elution with benzene gave 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde (200 mg, m.p. 84-85deg, lit.6 m.p. 84-85deg). Elution with benzene-AcOEt 4:1 gave first 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamyl alcohol (80 mg, m.p. 75-77deg, lit.7 m.p., which we were not able to confirm, 123deg) and next syringic aldehyde (120 mg, m.p. 108-110deg, lit.8 m.p. 109-110deg). The identifications were obtained by spectral means and confirmed by direct comparison with authentic samples.

_Comments_. Surprisingly 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamyl alcohol and 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde seem to be rare natural products. While the proven occurrence of the aldehyde was so far restricted to two Lauraceae (camphor tree,9 sassafras6), the alcohol does not seem to have been isolated previously.
