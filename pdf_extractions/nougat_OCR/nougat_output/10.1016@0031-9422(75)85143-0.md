## Jureusolide: A \(\gamma\)-lactone from _Iryanthera jureusis_

_Iryanthera jureusis_; Myristicaceae: 2\(R\)4R_-dihydroxy-20-piperonyleicosanoic acid \(\gamma\)-lactone;

juruenolide.

The chemical investigation of the trunk wood of a specimen of _Iryanthera juruensis_ Warb. (Myristicaceae), revealed the presence of sitosterol, sitostenone, (+-)2'-hydroxy-7-methoxy-4',5'-methylenedioxyflavan [1] and a lactone, C27H42O5, designated juruenolide. The PMR spectra of the compound and of its acetate allowed expansion of the formula to 1a. This contains a piperonylethyl unit (+- 3-3-5, 3ArH; 4:16, O2CH2; 7:53, \(t\), \(J\) 7:5 Hz, ArCH2CH2), a methylene chain (+- 8:2-8:8, 15 CH2), whose signal covers an additional one H signal, and a hydroxy-\(\gamma\)-lactone unit (1a _v_max 1745 cm-1;1b _v_max 1770, 1730 cm-1). The allocation of the hydroxyl to C-2 and of the methylene chain to C-4 of this lactone was based on the analysis of the signals associated with its 2 oxymethine and 2 methylene protons. The latter can only be situated on C-3. Double irradiation experiments revealed one of them (+- 8:7) to be coupled to H-4 (+- 5:52) and the other one (+- 7:44) to H-2 (+- 5:88). Further correlation of the \(t\) 5:88 doublet with the carbonicic proton was based on the paramagnetic shift (D - 0:86 ppm) of this signal upon acetylation.

The relatively high \(t\) value (8:7) of one of the methylene proton signals indicated that the corresponding H-3 is situated well over the plane of the carbonyl. Coupling and absence of coupling was seen as evidence, respectively, for its _cis_-relation to H-4 and _trans_-relation to H-2. An identical conclusion about the relative stereochemistry of juruenolide was reached upon observing the coupling of the relatively deprotected(+- 7:44), and hence _quasi_-equatorial, H-3 to H-2 and the absence of coupling to H-4. According to the modified Hudson rule [2], formula 1a represents also the absolute configuration of the lactone, since this is more dextro-rotatory, [z]20 +- 12:5(MeOH), than its potassium salt [z]20 +- 10:0(MeOH).

The biogenetic origin of juruenolide (1a) could involve condensation of a C18-fatty acid precursor (**2**) with an activated cinnamic acid (**3**), via an intermediate such as **4**. The additional oxygenation of **2** has been postulated previously to explain the biosynthesis of the avocatins and the rubrenolides [3], constituents of the Lauraceae, a family which is morphologically closely related with the Myristicaceae.

## Experimental

_Isolation of the constituents of_ Irvanthera juruensis. A tree at the Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus, identified by the botanist Rodrigues (Herbaria Chem. 40/72, conf. with Bot. 35391, INPA, Manaus) gave a trunk wood sample (4-4 kg) which was dried, powdered and extracted with C6H6. The CHCl3 soluble portion of the extract (16 g) was chromatographed on silica. The following useful fractions were eluted with the indicated solvents: A1 (C6H6-CHCl3, 19:1), A2 (C6H6-CHCl3, 9:1), A3 (CHCl3). A1 (425 mg) was fractionally crystallized from MeOH giving _stostenone_ (7 mg) and _stostensted_ (20 mg). A2 (170 mg) was crystallized from MeOH giving (+-)2-_hydroxy-_7-methoxy-4'-5'-methyl-_enedioxytflaan_ (27 mg) [1]. A3 (1-69 g) was recrystallized from MeOH giving _juruenolide_ (80 mg).
