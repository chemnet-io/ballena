# Neoligans from an _Aniba_ species*

Cacilda J. Aiba, Joao B. Fernandes, Otto R. Gottlieb and Jose G. Soares Maia

# Abstract

A benzene extract of the trunk wood of an _Aniba_ species contained 3a-allyl-2-aryl-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2,3,3a,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofurans; 5-allyl-2-aryl-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofurans; 6-0-allyl-2-aryl-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans; 7-allyl-2-aryl-6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans; 1-allyl-4,8-dihydroxy-7-(3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl)-6-methyl-3-oxobicyclo{3,2,1}octane.

Aniba burchellii Kosterman contains the neolignan burchellii (1a) [2] whose biosynthesis probably involves oxidative coupling of isoeugenol and eugenol units [3]. Fractionation of a C6H6-extract of an _Aniba_ sp. akin to the _gigantiglia_ O. C. Schmidt [4]--_guianensis_ Aubl. [5]--_hostmanniana_ (Nees) Mez [6]--group, whose classification will be possible upon completion of the revision of Lauraccac by Dr. K. Kubitzki, Hamburg, gave 3 additional burchellin analogues (1c, 1d, 1e), also 2 a-allycyclohexadienones (2b, 2c), 2 _O_-allyphenols (3c, 7), 2 _C_-allylphenols (4b, 4d) and a bicyclo[3,2,1]octane derivative (9). The formation of the compounds belonging to structural types 2, 3 (=7) and 4 can best be explained by sequential Cope, retro-Claisen and Claisen rearrangements of compounds belonging to type 1. Thus, although 1b and 8 were not isolated during the present work, their natural occurrence is highly probable. In the laboratory, these reactions require high temperatures (Table 1). The instability of burchellin (1a) upon treatment with 4 N KOH in MeOH at reflux temp. is known [2] and slight decomposition of 1e and 2c in boiling EtOH-C6H5H5NET2 19:1 was observed. Under plant extraction conditions, however, i.e. in refluxing neutral or acid treated C6H6 or EtOH, 1e and 2c are completely stable. Compounds belonging to all 4 structural types, including the missing links 2a, 2d, 2e, 3a, 3b, 3d, 3e, 4a, 4c and 4c, may thus occur naturally.

Structural assignments of type 1 compounds were based on comparison of data with published data for 1a. With the exception of signals due to differential substitution, significant PMR-spectral similarities and dissimilarities (Table 2) showed 1c, like burchellin (1a), to be a 2,3-_trans_ derivative (Me-3 \(t\) 8:8) and 1d and 1e to be 2,3-_cis_

derivatives (Me-3 \(\tau\) 9:5). The compounds of type **2** (Table 2) were clearly again 2.3-_trans_ derivatives (Me-3 \(\tau\) 8:6) supporting the allyl group on a sp3-C (CH2 \(\tau\) 7:6). Since one of their methoxyls (\(\tau\) 7:0), however, had also to be placed on a sp3-C, and only one fully substituted sp3-C can exist in these molecules, an a,b \(\gamma\),d rather than an a,b-a',b' unsaturated cyclohexadiene system characterizes these compounds and determined, as expected [2], the appearance of UV maxima at relatively higher wavelenth (315 nm, against 260 nm in all compounds of type **1**). IR carbonyl maxima present at 1640 cm-1 in compounds of type **1** and 1685 cm-1 in compounds of type **2**, are absent from the spectra of compounds belonging to types **3**, **4**, **5** and **6**. These are, indeed, either 2,3-_trans_ (**3c**; **4a**, 4b, **4c**; **5a**, **5b**, **5c**; **6**: Me-3 \(\tau\) 8:6) or 2,3-_cis_ (**4d**, **4e**; **5d**, **5e**: Me-3 \(\tau\) 9:2) dihydrobenzofurans with the allyl groups either on oxygen (3c, 7: CH2 \(\tau\) 5:5), carbon (**4a**-c**; **6c**: CH2 \(\tau\) 6:6) or absent (**5a**-e).

Interpretation of the MS (Scheme 1) relied upon previously formulated rearrangement and fragmentation paths [2] and were fully consistent with the proposed structures. These were further checked by PMR double irradiation experiments involving H-3. In each of the cases studied (**1c**, **1d**, **1e**; **2b**, **2c**; **4d**) the doublets attributed to Me-3 and H-2 collapsed to singlets. Additionally, irradiation at the allyl methine proton frequency of

**2b** and **2c** lessened considerably the resolution of the CH2-bands.

Pyrolysis of the compounds of type **1**, **2** and **3**, leading to expected products (Table 1), confirmed the proposed structures and solved some of the stereochemical problems. Initially, since all the derived, natural and synthetic, _trans_-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans (types 3-7, series a-c) give ORD curves [\(\hat{\lambda}\)(nm) of extrema: tr (315 +- 7), 0 (301 +- 4), pk (287 +- 3), tr (267 +- 3), pk 248 (+- 7)] of (2S,3S)-compounds [2], the absolute configuration at C-2 and 3 must be as shown in **1**-**7**, series a-c, and only the stereochemistries of C-3a in **1a** and **1c**, and of C-5 in **2b** and **2c** remain to be determined. The ORD curves of **1a** and **1c** are different and the compounds must be epimeric at C-3a. Indeed, the PMR signals due to the CH2-groups at this chiral centre occur at significantly higher field in the spectrum of **1c** than of **1a** (D 0 27 and 0 17 ppm). The allyl group of **1c** must thus possess the 3aS-configuration, protruding into the relatively protected zone above the aromatic ring. In contrast, the _trans_-arrangement (2S,3aR-configuration) must exist between the allyl group and the aromatic ring of burchelin (**1a**). Since it is highly probable that **2c** is the Cope rearrangement product of **1c**, it must show the 5R-configuration. Although **1b**, the putative precursor of **2b**, was not isolated, the (2S,3S,5R)-stereochemistry can nevertheless also be assumed for **2b**, due to the similarity of its ORD curve and the curve of **2c**.

. To our knowledge no correlations of stereochemistry and ORD curves of 2,3-_cis_-dihydrobenzofurans have yet been published. Thus, at this time, it can only be stated that all the natural and synthetic _cis_-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans (types **4**, **5**; series d, e), giving similar ORD curves [2(nm) of extrema: pK (314 +- 7), 0 (295 +- 10), tr (282 +- 6), 0 (265 +- 6), pk (245 +- 0)], have identical absolute stereochemistry. The parent compounds, whose relative configuration is shown in **1d** and **1e**, have of course not only this same stereochemistry at C-2,3, but also identical configuration

at C-3a, in view of the similarity of their ORD curves. Close correspondence of CH2-chemical shifts exists for **1**a on one hand, and **1**d and **1**e on the other. A _trans_-relationship between the allyl groups and the aromatic rings of **1**d and **1**e is thus tentatively considered.

The formula of compound **9**, C20H24O6, established by high resolution MS, was expanded to C18H17O.2OH.OMe.O2CH2 after inspection of the 220 MHz PMR spectrum. The compound is thus an isomer of canellin-C for which, tentatively, structures **10** or **11**[7] were

a carbonyl in saturated environment (_v_max 1705 cm-1) and the PMR spectra of **9** and cancellation-C were also very similar (Table 3). The significant differences concern the methoxyl which, situated on the aliphatic portion of canellin-C (t 6'72), substitutes the aryl group of **9** (t 6'20). The oxymethine proton at C-2 of **9** is thus not adjacent to a fully substituted bridgehead carbon, as in canellin C (t 5'90, _s_), and represented by a doublet (t 5'87). The H-8 signal continues as a singlet (canellin-C +-5'63, 9 t 5'80). The dihedral angle HC(8)-C(5)H must, thus, measure around 82deg, a fact which requires the hydroxyl at C-8 to be directed towards the 5-membered ring (cf. [5]). Since the benzylic CH is represented by a clean doublet, this group cannot be adjacent to C-5 and structure **9** results. The _trans_-arrangement of the aryl and methyl substituents is compatible with the CH3-frequency which occurs at relatively high field (t 9'12). All prominent mass spectral peaks are easily rationalized on grounds of structure **9** (Scheme 2).

## EXPERIMENTAL

_Isolation of the constituents._ Plant material of an _Aniba_ sp. from the Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus, Amazonas, was deposited at INPA, Manaus, Herbaria Bot. 42237, Chem. 31/73. A description is available from the botanist W. Rodrigues. Trunk wood (5 kg) gave a C6H6 ext. (14-4 g) which was chromatographed on a silica (300 g) column, giving the following fractions with the indicated eluants: A1(C6H6), A2 (C6H6-EtOH 99:8:0?), A3 and A4 (C6H6-EtOH 99:5:0?), A1 was crystallized from MeOH giving sitosterol (158 mg). The mother liquor was purified by TLC (SiO2, CHCl3-MeOH 95:5) to give 2b (152 mg). A2 was fractionated by TLC (SiO2, CHCl3-MeOH 99:1) into 2b (35 mg), 9 (12 mg), 3c (25 mg) and to (29 mg). A3 was fractionated by TLC (SiO2, Et1O) into 3c (145 mg), 1c (27 mg), a mixt. of 4d + 4b (37 mg), 7 (22 mg) and 1d (59 mg). Similarly, A4 gave 1d (347 mg), 2c (776 mg) and 1e (387 mg).

_Pyolysis of the constituents_ (Table 1). A soln of the cmpd in the indicated solvent under N2 was maintained at the indic. temp. for the indic. time. The cooled reaction mixture was ext. with Et2O. The Et2O-soln. was washed with 10% aq. HCl, H2O and dried. The solvent was evaporated and the residue fractionated by TLC (conditions indic.) into products which were eluted with solvents and weighed. TLC-spots indicated quantitative conversion into the indic. products. The elution technique, however, resulted in losses of _ca_ 40%.
