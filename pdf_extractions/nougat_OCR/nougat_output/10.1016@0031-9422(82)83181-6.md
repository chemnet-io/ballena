###### Abstract

The seed of _Virola sebifera_ contains besides the polyketide 1 - (2',6' - dihydroxyphenyl) - 11 - phenylundecan - 1 - one, four neoligans: (2S, 3S, 4R) - 4 - hydroxy - 2,3 - dimethyl - 5,6 - methylenedioxy - 4 - piperonyl - 1 - tetralone and its 2-epimer, as well as (2R, 3R, 4S) - 4 - hydroxy - 6,7 - dimethoxy - 2,3 - dimethyl - 4 - piperonyl - 1 - tetralone and its (2R, 3S, 4R) - dehydroxy analogue.

## Introduction

_Virola sebifera_ is widely distributed over South America. The species has been reported (under the synonym _V.enezuelens_i Warb.) to yield a fat that is valued for treatment of rheumatism in Venezuela [2]. Although in Brazil this "ucuubua" fat is expressed for industrial purposes, and the bark of the tree serves in the preparation of hallucinogenic snuffs by Amazonian Indians [2], such uses are seemingly restricted to northern regions and _V. sebifera_ remains without conspicuous use in Sao Paulo State.

The compositions of the triacylglycerols [3, 4] and of the psychotomimetic drug [2, 5] are fairly well known. Since the biological activity of the crude fat can hardly be due to the lipids the chemical analysis of the seed seemed in order. Indeed, the present work shows this to be a rich source of novel compounds, the polyketide **1a**, the oxo-otobains **2a**, **2b**, **3a**, **3b**, as well as further metabolites to be described in a subsequent report.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Compound **1a**, C23H30O3, was recognized as a diarylundecanone by the 1H NMR signals for two symmetrical aromatic rings, a phenyl group and a 2,6-dihydroxybenzoyl group, as well as for ten methylene units, two of which placed a to carbonyl or aryl moieties. Acetylation of **1a** led to the monoacetate **1b** which, as the parent compound, showed an AlCl3 UV shift and a 1620 cm-1 IR band, both indicative of an _ortho_-hydroxycarbonyl substituted aromatic ring. In contradistinction, no AlCl3 UV shift was observed for the diacetate (**1c**) and, as expected, the IR carbonyl band appeared at 1700 cm-1. The mass spectra were compatible with the structures, showing the base peaks at _m/z_ 137 (dihydroxybenzoyl ions) and peaks of moderate relative intensity at _m/z_ 91 (tropylium ions). In the spectra of **1b** and **1c** peaks at _m/z_ 179 (acetoxy-hydroxybenzoyl ion) and 221 (diacetoxybenzoyl ion) were also present.

The structure of the diarylundecanoid **1a** from _V. sebifera_ belongs to a type previously detected in the fruits of _Myristica malabarica_ Lam. [6]. The most significant difference between **1a** and the malabarices (**1d**, **1e**, **1f**, **1g**) refers to the biosynthesis which seemingly involves the condensation of cinnamic acid with myristic acid in the former case and with lauric acid in the latter case.

Compounds **2a**, **2b**, **3a** and **3b** were recognized as 4-aryletralin neoplasms by joint consideration of the formulae, respectively C18H13OH (O2CH2)2O, C18H13OH(O2CH2)2O, C18H13OH(OMe)2O2CH2O, C18H14(OMe)2O2CH2O, the 1H NMR spectra of which all contained a pair of methyl doublets (_J_ = 7 Hz), and the mass spectra, which all contained prominent [M - MeOH+CHMe]+ peaks. The uncharacterized oxygen atom of the formulae must belong to a carbonyl which in all four compounds is part of a benzoyl unit (_r_max1674 +- 9 cm-1), and thus can occupy only position 1 of the tetralins. The vicinal aromatic position 8 must be unsubstituted, as indicated by 1H NMR signals at relatively low field: d 7.65 +- 0.05 (_d_, \(J\) = 8 Hz) for **2a** and **2b**; d 7.51 +- 0.05 (_s_) for **3a** and **3b** (Table 1). While these data define the constitution of the bis-methylenedioxytertains of series **2**, doubts remain concerning the relative position of the vicinal metchoxyls and the methylenedioxy units in the compound of series **3**.

Conclusive proof of the carbon skeleton was obtained for **3a**. Acid dehydration of this compound leads to the 4-aryl-1-naphthol, similar in respect to UV, IR and 1H NMR characteristics to tetrahedydroisogalactin (**4b**). Conspicuous spectral differences

concern the hydroxyl IR band at 3448 cm-1 and the aromatic 1H NMR singlet at \(d\) 7.48 respectively only present in the spectra of **4a** and **4b**.

The difference between compounds **2a** and **2b** is of a stereochemical nature as shown by 1H NMR measurements. Indeed, the coupling constant of the H-2, H-3 interaction is much larger for **2a** (12 Hz) than for **2b** (3 Hz) and a _trans_ diaxial relation characterizes this system in the former compound. Both methyl substituents of **2a** must hence be equatorial, a conformation which can be equally assigned to the piperonyl group in view of its differential shielding effect on the methylene protons (_d_ 5.66 and 5.78, doublets, \(J\) = 2 Hz) of the CH2O2 substituent on positions 5 and 6. Acid or alkaline treatment of **2a**, a reaction which would be expected to epimerize C-2, generates **2b**. In this compound, the steric strain resulting from the 1,3-_cis_ interaction of the methyl at C-2 and the hydroxyl at C-4 should cause a change of conformation whereby the carbonyl and the piperonyl

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline  & **2a** & **2b** & **3a** & **3b** \\ \hline H-8 & 7.60 (_d_, \(J\) = 8) & 7.69 (_d_, \(J\) = 8) & 7.46 (_s_) & 7.56 (_s_) \\ H

groups move somewhat from their location in the equatorial plane. Indeed, the carbonyl of **2b** (_n_max 1683 cm ') shows less conjugation with the aromatic ring than the carbonyl of **2a** (_n_max 1670 cm-'); and although the differential action on the methylene protons of the CH2O2 group at positions 5 and 6 remains, no shielding effect is perceptible (d 6.03 and 6.00, doublets, \(J\) = 2 Hz).

The _trans_, _trans_-configuration of the two methyl and the aryl substituents, which prevails in **2a**, is also observed for **3a** and **3b**. Again _J_H_-2,H_-3, (12 Hz for **3a** and **3b**) is rather large, as is _J_H_-3,H_-4 (8 Hz) in **3b**; and again the equatorial piperonyl group causes shielding effects, on H-5 and on Me-3 (d 6.29, d 0.88 respectively for **3a** and 6.26, d 0.97 respectively for **3b**).

While 4-aryltetradane neolignans have not been reported previously, 4-aryltetralin neolignans are well known [7]. According to Crabbe and Klyne [8] the sign of the Cotton effect of the benzoicd chromophore between 275 and 290 nm is indicative of the configuration of the 4-aryl substituent, a positive effect pointing to an _a_-aryl group and vice versa. Based on this rule, Klyne _et al._[9] assigned the (2\(S\), 3\(R\), 4_S_) and (2\(S\), 3\(R\), 4_R_) stereochemistries to hydroxyotobain (**5a**) and otobain (**5b**), constituents of _Dialyanthene atobba_ (Myristicaceae).

Defunctionalization of **2a** at C-1, by sequential LiAlH4 reduction to **2c** and hydrogenolysis, gave hydroxyotobain (**2e**) identical, with respect to the ORD curve, to the compound from _D. otoba_. The CD curve, however, shows that the Cotton effect in the 280-290 nm region is negative (Table 2) and that hence, according to Crabbe and Klyne's rule [8], the _b_-aryl (4_R_) configuration must be assigned to hydroxyotobain **2e**, not **5a**). The wrong stereochemical assignments for hydroxyotobain and for otoabin in the published report [9] is due to the fact that the authors deduced the sign of the Cotton effect considering the spectral region above instead of below 280 nm.

Transformation of **2a** into **2e** excluding alterations in chirality implies that **2a** must possess the (2\(S\), 3\(S\), 4_R_)-configuration. Its positive Cotton effect at the absorption of the carbonyl chromophore (333 nm) contrasts with the negative effects at the same wavelength of **2b**, **3a** and **3b** which thus must possess respectively the (2\(R\), 3\(S\), 4_R_), (2\(R\), 3\(R\), 4_S_) and (2\(R\), 3\(S\), 4_R_) configurations.

## EXPERIMENTAL

### Isolation of constituents

Ripening fruits of _V. sebifera_ Aubl. were collected by Hipolito F. Paulino Filho, UNESP, Arazuqura, from a specimen, identified by Dr. William A. Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus, near Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso, Minas Gerais State. The seeds had their epicarp removed, were air dried (72 hr) and ground to a mass (225 g) which was exhaustively extracted with C6H6 at room temp. The solvent was evapd and the residue (60 g) partitioned between petrol and MeOH-H2O (9:1). The former soln was evapd yielding fats. The latter soln was evapd and the residue dissolved in EtOAc. The soln was washed with H2O, 10% aa. NaHCO3 and 2% aa. HCl. The EtOAc soln was evapd and the residue (22 g) submitted to dry CC (400 **5** Si, EtCH3-EtOAc, 97:3). The column was cut into 33 portions. Portions 1-9 were crystallized from MeOH to yield fats (3.5 g). The mother liquor was evapd and the residue separated by prep. TLC (Al3O3, CHCl3) into **1a** (400 mg) and **3b** (38 mg). Portions 10-14, 15-23 and 24-28 gave products which were purified by repeated prep. TLC (Si gel) into **2b** (114 mg), **2a** (2.1 g), **3a** (164 mg) respectively. Portions 29-33 were reserved for work to be reported in a later paper.
