# Abstract

The trunk bark of _Ocotea catharinensis_ yielded, besides the known bicyclo(3.2.1)octanoli neoligans canellin-C and 5'-methoxycanellin-C, two epimers rel-(1R,4S and 4_R,5S,6R,7S,8R_)-1-allyl-4,8-dihydroxy-3,5-di-methoxy-7-methyl-6-piperonyl-bicyclo(3.2.1)oct-2-enes and rel-(1R,5S,6R,7S,8R)-1-allyl-3,8-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-7-methyl-6-piperonyl-4-oxobicyclo(3.2.1)oct-2-ene. The hydrogenofuranoid neoligans are represented by the equally novel (2S,3S,5R)-5-allyl-5,7-dimethoxy-3-methyl-2-piperonyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran and (2R,3S,3aS)-3a-ally-5,7-dimethoxy-3-methyl-2-piperonyl-2,3a,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofuran.

## Introduction

The wood of _Ocotea catharinensis_ Mez is a much appreciated article of commerce [2]. The tree, popularly known as 'canela preta', occurs in the Atlantic forest. A specimen was collected in the Cunha region, Sao Paulo State, and identified by Professor Klaus Kubitzki, University of Hamburg. Fractionation of the light petrol extract of its bark gave the neoligans **1a**, **1b**, **2a**, **2b**, **3a**, **4a** and **5a**. For reasons stated in a previous paper of this series [3], nomenclature and numbering of neoligans follow the rules outlined in a recent review [4].

## Results and discussion

Compounds **2a** and **2b** have been isolated respectively from _Licaria canella_ (Meissn.) Kosterm. [5] and from _Aniba williamsi_ O. C. Schmidt. The analysed samples of the latter species were originally designated _A. simulans_ Allen [6], an error which was recently corrected [7]. We have indicated previously that compounds of type **2** should be artifacts of isolation [8]. Indeed, the putative precursors of **2a**, namely **1a** and **1b**, are also present in the extract of _O. catharinensis_. As expected [8], compound **1a** in chloroform is demethylated into **2a** in

the presence of a trace of acid at room temperature. Compounds **1a** and **1b** show very similar IR and mass spectra. According to their \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR data they differ only with respect to the configuration of the hydroxyl group at C-4', endo-oriented in **1a** (\(\gamma\)-effects on C-7 and C-6' for **1a** vs **1b** each \(\delta-2.0\)) and exo-oriented in **1b** (\(\gamma\)-effect on C-2' for **1b** vs **1a** \(\delta 4.2\)).

Acetylation (acetic anhydride, pyridine) at room temperature transformed **1a** into the monoacetate **1c**, and **1b** into the diacetate **1c**. Complete acetylation of **1a** into **1d** required heating. The monoacetate **1c** is constitutionally identical with **6**, a compound isolated from _Octoce_ sp. [8]. Stereochemically the compounds differ in the configurations of the aryl group at C-7 and the methyl group at C-8. The former is endo-situated in **6**, exerting protection on the acetate protons (\(\delta 1.54\)), and exo-situated in **1c** (acetate, \(\delta 2.14\)). The latter is exo-situated in **6** (Me-8, \(\delta 1.14\)) and endo-situated in **1c**, suffering protection by the bicyclo-octane system (\(\delta 0.85\)).

Spectral comparison of **3a** and of its diacetate **3b**, the latter prepared by acetylation (acetic anhydride, pyridine) of the former at room temperature, with **3c** from _Aniba williamsii_[6, 7] showed that all differences can be accounted for by the absence of methoxyl substitution of the aromatic ring in **3a** and **3b**.

Structure **4a** was established by \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR as well as ORD comparison with **4b** from _Aniba terminals_ Ducke [9, 10] and **7** from _A. burchellii_ Kosterman [9, 11, 12]. The sole constitutional difference between the novel **4a** and the model compounds is the presence of an additional methoxyl group at C-3' of the former. Stereochemically, **4a** is identical with **4b**, both showing the absence of the reciprocal \(\gamma\)-effect of C-9 (\(\delta 11.95\pm 0.05\)) and C-7' (\(\delta 43.85\pm 0.05\)) which exists in 7 with _cis_-C-9 (\(\delta 8.3\))/C-7' (\(\delta 36.6\)) [9]; both showing the protection exerted by the urgs on the _C_-methyl protons (\(\delta 0.50\)) which is absent from 7 with _trans_-Ar/Me (\(\delta 1.16\)) [9]; and both showing positive/negative Cotton effects which are negative/positive at the same wavelengths, respectively 260/295 nm, for **7**[13].

Structure **5a** was established by \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR comparison with **5b** from _Aniba terminals_[10, 14], as well as by ORD comparison with **5b** and **8** from _A. williamsii_[15] and **9** from _A. burchellii_[14]. As in the case of **4a**, the sole constitutional difference between the novel **5a** and the model compound **5b** is the presence of an additional methoxyl at C-3' of the former. Stereochemically, **5a, 5b** and **9** do not show the methyl protection (\(\delta 1.31\pm 0.06\)) which exists in **8** (Me-8, \(\delta 0.93\)) due to the _cis_-relationship of the aryl and methyl groups. The 75, \({}^{1}R\)-configurations are deduced for **5a** in view, respectively, of its negative Cotton effects at 280 nm which it shares with **5b** and **9**, and at 315 nm which is shares with **5b** and **8**. Positive Cotton effects at 280 and 315 nm respectively, are diagnostic for the 7R-configuration in **8** and the 13S-configuration in **9**[13].

## Experimental

_Isolation of the constituents of O. catharinensis._ Dry trunk bark was powdered (1.2 kg) and percolated with petrol. The extract (50 g) was chromatographed (CC-1) on Si gel [300 g, petrol-EtOAc (9:1), fractions of 200 ml). Fractions 35 and 36 (15 g) were recarbonatographed (CC-2) on Si gel [200 g, CHCl3-EtOAc (19:1), fractions of 100 ml). Fractions 13-23 were purified on an alumina column (CC-3) (petrol-EtOAc, 9:1) to a binary mixture which, on a Si gel column (CC-4) (Et\({}_{1}\)O), gave **5a** (2 g). Fractions 24-28 (CC-2) were chromatographed (CC-5) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, fractions of 50 ml). TLC of fractions 22-47 (CC-5) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, fractions of 50 ml). TLC of fractions 22-47 (CC-5) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, fractions of 50 ml). **(100 mg)**, Fractions 22-48 (CC-2) were chromatographed (CC-5) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, fractions of 50 ml). TLC of fractions 22-47 (CC-5) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, \(\sim\) 100 ml). Fractions 35-42 (CC-5) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, \(\sim\) 10 ml). Fractions 35-42 (CC-2) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, fractions of 20 ml). Fractions 35-43 (CC-2) on Si gel (100 g, CHCl3, fractions of 20 ml). Fractions 35-44 (CC-1) was recrystallized from CCl4 to give **4a** (1.5.8).
