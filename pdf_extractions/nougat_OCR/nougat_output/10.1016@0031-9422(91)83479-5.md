# Abstract

Bark, wood and leaves of _Ocotea catharinensis_ contain respectively 10 (average yield 0.7%0), 15 (average yield 0.004%0) and one (yield 0.4%0) neoligans of the bicyclo[3.2.1]octanol and the hydrobenzofuranoid structural types, including the new _rel_-(_T_S_,8\(R\)1'_R_,4_'S_,5_'R_,6_'_R_)-_A_*_*_4_,6_'_-dihydroxy-5'-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-oxo-8.1',7.5'-neoligan, (_T_S_,8_S_)-_A_*_*_3_*_*

Neolignan **6a** has been found in _Ocotea veraguensis_[9] and served as model compound in the structural determination of **6b**. The sole relevant discrepancies in the 1H NMR spectra of the compounds are due to differences in aromatic substitution (Table 3). Furthermore, both compounds display negative Cotton effects for the benzenoid chromophores at _ca_ 293 nm and hence must belong to the absolute configurational series shown in the formulae.

Among the four hexahydrobenzofuranoid neoligans isolated, only 7a is a new compound, 7b-d have been obtained previously from _Amba ferrea_[11], _Licaria armeniaca_[12] and _L. canella_[6] respectively. Again comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of the four compounds made the structural elucidation of 7a a trivial matter. The correctness of this deduction was confirmed by NOESY and X-ray diffraction crystallography (Fig. 1), and the absolute configuration shown here is based on the positive Cotton effect for the transition n-p*[14] ([f0]311 + 29 750) observed for this compound.

Neolignan ferrezani C (**8a**) has been found previously in _Ocotea acipylulla_[8, 15] and served as model compound in the structural elucidation of 8b. The relevant spectral differences suggested the pair to constitute C-7 primers (Table 4). Indeed NOESY experiments revealed the spatial proximity of H-7\(b\) and Me-8\(b\) as well as of H-7\(b\) and H-6

7a, and frs 91-97 (7:3) were not further examined. Up to fr. 72 all products were purified by repeated flash chromatography on silica gel. From latter firs compounds were pptd by addition of Et2O and recrystallized, in CCl4. The leaf extract in petrol was filtered, coned to 250 ml and cooled in an ice-bath (overnight). The ppt. was sepd by filtration and suspended in MeOH. The insol. part was sepd by filtration. The soln was evapd and the residue recrystallized from CCl4 to 7a.
