# Tocotrienols from _Iryanthera grandis_

Paulo C. Vieira, Otto R. Gottlieb, Hugo E. Gottlieb

# Abstract

The fruits of _Iryanthera grandis_ contain the four compounds related with the cocotrienol group: 2,8-dimethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyl-3,7,11-tridecatrienyl)-6-chromanol; 2,8-dimethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyl-3,7,11-tridecatrienyl)-6-chromanol; 2,8-dimethyl-2-(4,12-dimethyl-8-carboxyl-3,7,11-tridecatrienyl)-6-chromanol and 5-hydroxy-7-(3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2,6,10,11-hexadecatrienyl)-2(3_H_)benzofuranone; the neolignan (2R3,R4,8)-2,3-dimethyl-4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-6-hydroxytetralin; and the flavonoid 2',4'-dihydroxy-4,6'-dimethoxydihydrochaincone.

## INTRODUCTION

_Iryanthera grandis_ Ducke, known as ucu-tiba vermelha, occurs in the central region of the Amazon, in the Madeira and Tapajoz basins [2]. The epithet of the latin name refers to the size of the fruits, larger than usual for other Myristicaceae. The present paper discloses the presence in these fruits, besides triglycerides (1), of seven compounds, **2a**, **2d**, **3a** and **4a**, related with the cocotrienol group of compounds, **5a**, a neolignan, **6**, a dihydrochaincone, and **7**, grandinolide. The last named compound has been described in a previous paper [3]. An additional isolate **8**, ethyl oleate, should be an artifact produced during the fractionation of the extract.

## RESULTS

Compound **2a** was identified with d-tocotrienol [4] by spectral means (Table 1), as well as transformation into the monosaccharide (**2b**) and the hexahydro-derivative (**2c**, Tables 2 and 3). All 13C NMR peaks (Table 3) were assignable either to the farnesyl moiety (R1) (for data on model 9 sec [5]) or to the benzopyran moiety (for data on model 2e see [6]). The relative positions of the substituents on the aromatic ring were confirmed by 1H NMR double resonance experiments and by a negative Gibbs test [7].

The mass spectrum of **2a** (M+ 396, rel. int. 50%) showed peaks suggesting two series of fragments, one involving farnesyl (_m/z_ 205, 6%), geranyl (_m/z_ 137, 74%) and prexyl (_m/z_ 69, 100%) cations, and the other involving **10** as parent cation. The structural proposal for **3a** (M+ 790, rel. int. 90%) relied initially on the fact that this compound also generated the indicated series of fragments, together with additional ions of putative structures **11** (_m/z_ 410, 5%) and **12** (_m/z_ 191, 8%). Thus compound **3a** was an oxidative dimer of **2a**. Indeed the IR spectra of both substances were very similar, the hydroxyl band of **3a**, however, being less intense. As was to be expected, the latter compound also gave only a monoacetate (**3b**), besides a dodecahydro-derivative (**3c**, Table 2). The aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of **3a** (Table 1) showed a singlet (_d_6.69) due to an isolated proton, besides two doublets (_d_6.53 and 6.37, both \(J\) = 3.0 Hz) due to two _meta_ related protons. The connection of the two units thus involved the oxygen of the hydroxyl of one monomer and an aromatic carbon of the other monomer. _A priori_ both unsubstituted aromatic carbons of **2a** may function as bridgeheads in **3a**. No protective g-effect, however, was exerted on the relevant aromatic methyl carbon of **3a**. The 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table 3) of both aromatic methyls were closely comparable (_d_15.9 and 16.2; cf. also \(d\)16.0 for **2a**). Substitution thus could not occur also at the _ortho_-position of the methyl situated on the pentadiubstituted aromatic ring of **3a**.

The mass spectrum of **2d** (M+ 426, rel. int. 22%) again showed the characteristic series of peaks involving **10** as parent cation. Although the isopernoidal sequence was restricted to the prexyl (_m/z_ 69, 60%) fragment, the presence of an isopernyl side chain, even if in modified form, seemed certain. Thus compounds **2a** and **2d** appeared to have identical skeletons. Comparison of the MWs of both (396 vs. 426) revealed the existence of two hydrogens in the former as against two oxygens in the latter. Indeed, **2d** was an \(a\),_b_-unsaturated carboxylic acid (IR _v_max 1690 cm-1) which was transformed by diazomethane into a methyl ester (**2e**) and by acetic anhydride into a monoacetate (**2f**). Catalytic hydrogenation of this acetate led to a hexahydro-derivative (**2g**, Table 2), in complete agreement with the presence of an isopernoidal side chain. Prominent mass spectrum fragments of this compound (M+ '474, 60%) were **10** (_m/z_ 177, 29%) and **13** (_m/z_ 144, 50%). The latter, a McLafferty rearrangement product of **2d**, justified the placement of the carboxyl as shown in **2d**. All possible 1H NMR double irradiation experiments, as well as spectral comparisons of **2d** with **2a** and **14** [8] as model compounds (Table 1), consubstantiated the validity of the proposed structure **2d**.

As in the preceding compounds **2a**, **2d** and **3a**, also in **4a** (M + 422, rel. int. 8 %) the aromatic ring was substituted by an isoprenoidal side chain. Peaks due to premyl (_m_/_z_ 69, 100 %) and geranyl (_m_/_z_ 137, 25 %) appeared in the mass spectrum. In this case, however, the four C5-units formed a geranylgeranyl group, as indicated by 1H NMR signals (Table 1) assignable to four olefinic protons (d4.9-5.4), five vinylic methyls [d 1.60 (3), 1.66 (1), 1.74 (1)], twelve allylic protons (d1.9-2.2) and two allylic/benzylic protons (d3.27, \(d\), \(J\) = 7.0 Hz). Indeed, catalytic hydrogenation led to an octahydro-derivative (**4b**, Table 2) with only one pair of benzylic protons (d2.56, \(t\), \(J\) = 6.0 Hz). The aromatic ring of **4a** contained an additional benzyl group, represented by a two proton signal at relatively low field (d3.60, _br_, _sb_), and hence linked also to the butanolide carboxyl (IR _v_max, 1770 cm-1). Finally a phenolic hydroxyl, demonstrated by the formation of a monoacetate (**4c**), must be flanked by two aromatic protons (for the NMR

signal of both \(\Delta\delta\) C\({}_{5}\)D\({}_{5}\)N/CDCl\({}_{3}\) 0.50 [9]). Since these protons were practically equivalent (for both \(\delta\)6.51, \(s\)), they were symmetrically situated also with respect to the other oxy-function and the compound possessed structure **4a**.

The dihydroxy-4-aryltetralin structure proposed for compound **5a** was shown by the formation of a diacetate (**5b**), as well as on mass, \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectral comparison with known representatives of this series [10]. The major mass spectrum fragment (_m/z_ 212, 69 %) was formed by the retro Diels-Alder splitting of the elements of but-2-ene. It had to have the two hydroxyls on separate rings on account of the conspicuous hydroxy-tropyilium ion (_m/z_ 107, 18 %). The localization of one hydroxyl on the aromatic part of the tetralin system was ascertained through the existence of a _meta_-split doublet at relatively very high field (\(\delta\)6.2, \(J\) = 2.0 Hz) in the \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum, which could only belong to a _peri_-hydrogen protected by a nearby aryl group [11]. It was to be expected that this aryl would have two protons at C-2',

C-6' protected by a reciprocal effect, and two protons at C-3', C-5' protected by a vicinal 4'-hydroxyl in the proposed structure **5a**. Indeed, all four protons were represented by a multiplet centered at _ca_ 6.8. The C-4 aryl not only protected H-5, but also Me-3 (0.85). This fact required the 4-aryl and 3-methyl to possess equatorial conformations, inclusively because H-3 and H-4 had to be _trans_-diaxially related on the evidence of their coupling constant (_J_ = 9.0 Hz). The novel (**5a**) and known (**15a**, **b**) _trans_, _trans_-tetralin neoplasms [12, 13] showed comparable chemical shifts for Me-3/Me-2 (0.085/1.05 **5a**, 0.85/1.04 **15a**, 0.83/1.05 **15b**). Formula **5a** also represents the absolute configuration of the compound in view of a negative Cotton effect at 285 nm considered characteristic of 4_b_-aryls in tetralin neolignans [14]. The dihydro-chalcone 6 had been found previously in _1. laevis_[15] and, as ethyl oleate (8), was identified by direct comparison with an authentic sample.

## Discussion

Work with 14C-labelled precursors established homogentisic acid (16) as a probable intermediate in the biosynthesis of tocotinenols, tocoperhools and plastoquinones [16]. Formation of the nuclear C-methyl groups of these end products should involve decarboxylation. Exceptionally, the entire 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid moiety is retained in **4a**, consubstantiating the intermediary existence of **16**.

## Experimental

_Isolation of the constituents._ Fruits of _1. grands_ were collected in the Municipality of Itaituba, Part State, by Dr. Hipolito Paulino Ferreira Filho and identified by Dr. William Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus. Dry fruits were reduced to powder (130 g). This was percolated with C6H6. The soln was evaporated and the residue (90 g) was treated with EtOH. The EtOH insoluble portion was separated by filtration and recrystallized from EtOH to give 1 (50 g). The EtOH soln was evaporated and the residue (27 g) submitted to CC (400 8 silica gel). The following fractions (250 ml each) were obtained with the indicated eluents: Fractions 1-6 (C6H14-C6H6, 9:1), 7-13 (C6H14-C6H6, 4:1), 14 (C6H14-C6H6, 7:3), 15-21 (C6H14-C6H6, 1:1), 22-27 (C6H6), 28-29 (C6H6-EtOAc, 49:1), 30-32 (C6H6-EtOAc, 19:1), 33-34 (C6H6-EtOAc, 9:1), 35-(EtOAc). Fraction 9 gave 8 (200 mg) Fraction 17 was purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, C6H6) to 3a (200 mg) Fraction 22 contained 1 and 2a. Fraction 23 gave 2a (2 g). Fraction 26 was separated by prep. TLC (silica gel, C6H6-EtOAc, 19:1) into two portions. The more polar one was purted by prep. TLC (silica gel, C6H6-EtOAc, 49:1) to give 4a (15 mg). Fractions 32 and 33 were recrystallized from C6H6 to give 6 (120 mg). Fraction 34 was crystallized from MeOH to give 5 (70 mg). The mother liquor was purified by prep. TLC to 7 (100 mg). Fraction 35, filtered through active charcoal, was submitted to C6 (silica gel deactivated by 10% H2O). A fraction, eluted with C6H6-MeOH (19:1) was purified by prep. TLC to give 24 (80 mg).
