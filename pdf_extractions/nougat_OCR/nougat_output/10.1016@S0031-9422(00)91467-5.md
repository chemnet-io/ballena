# Abstract

The trunk wood of _Iryanthera polynerura_ Ducke (Myrsticaceae) contains pinocembrin,1-(2',4'-dihydro-xyphenyl)-3-(3'',4''-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane,1-(2',4'-dihydroxy-3'-methylphenyl)-3-(2''-methoxy-4'',5''-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane and 4,2',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxydihydrochalcone.

## INTRODUCTION

The nomadic and very primitive Maku Indians of the Apaporis basin (Amazonia) employ a plaster made of the crushed leaves of _Iryanthera polynerura_ Ducke (Myrsticaceae) for treating seriously infected wounds and cuts [3]. This ethnopharmacological observation stimulated interest in the chemistry of the tree, and a study on the composition of its trunk wood was undertaken. The results are reported in the present paper.

## RESULTS

Fractionation of a benzene extract of the trunk wood afforded, besides sitosterol and pinocembrin, the 1,3-diarylpropane **1a**, previously obtained from _I. coriacea_ Ducke [4], two novel compounds, the additional diary-propane **1c** and the dihydrochalcone **2a**, and a small quantity of a mixture containing two chalconestentitively formulated **3a** and **3b**.

The basic structure of the diarylpropane, C15H10-Me(OH)2OMe.O2CH2, was indicated by 1H and 13C NMR spectral evidence which pointed to a CH2.CH2. CH2 chain flanked by two aryl groups. One must bear 2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy substitutions. The base peak in the MS shows the correct mass for a methoxyphenylenedioxytropylim ion; the 1H NMR spectrum includes two singlets (6 3.34 and 3.42). The other aryl group bears 2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl substitution. The 1H NMR spectrum includes two doublets (6.36 and 6.72, \(J\) = 8 Hz); oxidation of the compound does not lead to _ortho_ or _para_-quinones; a 13C NMR quartet at high field (6 8.9)is compatible only with a methyl between two vicinal substituents [5]. The 13C NMR assignments for this 1,3-diarylpropane (**2c**) are compatible with the analogous data for **1a [4]** and virolane (**1b**) (see Experimental), previously obtained from _Virola multimeria_ Ducke [6].

The basic structure of the dihydrochalcone, C15H10-(OH)3OMe, was indicated by 1H and 13C NMR spectral evidence which pointed to a CH2.CH2 group flanked by benzoyl and aryl substituents. The benzoyl group must be 2,4-dihydroxyidated: the molecule has chelated and acidic hydroxyls evidenced by IR and UV (AlCl4 and NaOAc shifts) spectra; acetylation produces NMR shifts of the aromatic C signals which are closely comparable with the values observed for 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone (see Experimental). The aryl group must bear 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy substitution: the two oxy-functions are located at C-3 and C-4 (H-2, H-5 and H-6 give a NMR multiplet at 6.7-6.9); acetylation produces paramagnetic shifts

(+5.1 to +7.6 ppm) of the C-1, C-3 and C-5 signals, and a small diamagnetic shift (-2.1 ppm) of the C-4 signal, leaving the C-2 and C-6 signals practically unaffected. The MS of this dihydrochalcone (**2a**) is accordingly very simple, since both the dihydroxbgenzoyl ion and the hydroxypropylium ion have _m_/e 137.

The constituents of a mixture obtained in minute amount were tentatively characterized as chalcones **3a** and **3b** by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Not only the molecular peaks 286 (55 %) and 300 (45 %) of the MS, but also the fragment peaks due to dihydroxybenzoyl (_m_/_e 137 (100 %)), hydroxy-methoxystyryl (_m_/_e 150 (80 %)) and dimethoxystyryl (_m_/_e 164 (50 %)) ions, were consistent with this hypothesis.

## Discussion

The biosynthesis of cinnamylphenols in Leguminosae was postulated to involve the cinnamylation of triacetate moieties [7]. The fact that both the Leguminosae and the Myristicaceae are isoflavonoid accumulators invites the hypothesis that, as a further common biochemical feature, cinnamylation also occurs in both families, the 1,3-diarylpropanes of Myristicaceae being simply hydrogenation products of intermediate cinnamylphenols. It has, nevertheless, been suggested recently that the co-occurrence of 1,3-diarylpropanes with 1,3-diarylpropan-2-ols and flavans points to their biosynthetic derivation from chalcones [8], a postulate which allows now additional support by the isolation of a flavanone and, most importantly, by the co-occurrence of chalcone-dihydrochalcone-1,3-diarylpropane with identical oxygenation pattern in _Iryanthera polyneura_.

## Experimental

_Isolation of the constituents._ Trunk wood of _Iryanthera polyneura_ was collected near Manaus, Amazonas State, and identified by the botanist Dr. William A. Rodrigues. A \({\text{C}}_{6}{\text{H}}_{6}\) extract (4 %, 200 g) was chromatographed on a Si gel column. Petrol, \({\text{C}}_{6}{\text{H}}_{6}\)-CHCl3 and MeOH eluted, in order, aliphatic (100 g), aromatic (40 mg) and aliphatic (50 g) fractions. The aromatic fraction (25 g) was rechromatographed on a Si gel column. The following solvents eluted, in order, the indicated compounds \({\text{C}}_{6}{\text{H}}_{6}\): **1c** (150 mg) and pinocembrin (120 mg), \({\text{C}}_{6}{\text{H}}_{6}\)-CHCl3 8:2: sitosterol (500 mg). \({\text{C}}_{6}{\text{H}}_{6}\)-CHCl3 1:1:1a (1 g), a mixture of **3a** and **3b** (8 mg after purification by aq. \({\text{N}}_{2}{\text{C}}_{3}\)) and **2a** (160 mg).
