# Biomimetic synthesis of xuavariines Ea and Eb: Structure revision of _Rzedowskia_ bistriterpenoids

Neil E. Jacobsen,

# Abstract

Reaction of pristimerin with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) resulted in a biomimetic-type coupling leading to xuavariines Ea and Eb and not the previously reported _Rzedowskia_ bistriterpenoids I and II suggesting that the structures proposed for these natural products need revision. A product obtained in this reaction by an unusual Diels-Alder addition followed by _retro_-Diels-Alder-type elimination was characterized as pristimerin dicyanophenalenedione. Complete 1H, and 13C NMR spectral assignments of xuavariines Ea and Eb have been made by the application of 1D and 2D NMR techniques.

## 1 Introduction

The triterpenoid quinonemethides (celastroloids) constitute a relatively small group of unsaturated and oxygenated D:A-_friedo-nor_-oleananes with interesting structures and a variety of biological activities.1,2,3 A number of biseclastroloids have been recently encountered in plants of the family Celastracaea.4 These are composed of quinonomethide and aromatic forms of _nor_-triterpenes derived from pristimerin (**4a**), tingenone (**4b**), and 22-hydroxytingenone (**4c**) and/or their congeners, joined by two ether linkages formed between the A rings of the two elastroloids, or between the A and the B rings; only exceptions being _Rzedowskia_ bistriterpenoids I (**5a**) and II (**5b**)5 which contain a single ether linkage between the two subunits.44 Surprisingly, to date, there are no reported syntheses of biseclastroloids in which the two elastroloid moieties are joined by two ether linkages. In continuing our studies on reactions of celastroloids,6 we have explored the potential of DDQ-mediated oxidative coupling of triterpenoid quinonemethides for biomimetic-type syntheses of biseclastro-loids, and herein we report that the reaction of pristimerin with DDQ yields xuavariines Ea (**1**) and Eb (**2**). An unusual product obtained from this reaction was identified as pristimerin dicyanophenalenedione (**3**), formed probably by Diels-Alder-type addition of DDQ to pristimerin followed by _retro_-Diels-Alder-type elimination. Close resemblance of the spectral data of **1** and **2** with those reported for _Rzedowskia_ bistriterpenoids I (**5a**) and II (**5b**) together with some discrepancies in the assignment of their NMR data strongly suggest that the structures proposed by Gonzalez et al.44 for the _Rzedowskia_ bistriterpenoids require revision.

## 2 Results and discussion

Treatment of pristimerin (**4a**) with DDQ inoxane at room temperature and work-up after its disappearance (TLC control) followed by chromatographic separation of the resulting mixture afforded **1**-**3**. Compound **1** was obtained as a yellow solid that analyzed for C60H78O9 by a combination of HRFABMS and 13C NMR spectroscopy and indicated 22 degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3448, 1728 and 1651 cm-1 suggesting the presence of OH, ester carbonyl, and a,b-unsaturated carbonyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of 14

methyl singlets, two of which were due to OCH3 groups (\(\delta\) 3.54 and 3.60) and one attached to an aromatic ring (\(\delta\) 2.74). In the low-field region, it had signals due to an aromatic proton [\(\delta\) 6.80 (s)] and an olefinic proton [\(\delta\) 6.25 (s)] of a 6-oxo-phenolic type triterpenoid system,[7] and protons of a quinoneomethide system [\(\delta\) 6.09 (1H, d, \(J\) = 1.6 Hz), 6.24 (1H, dd, \(J\) = 6.6 and 1.6 Hz), 5.94 (1H, d, \(J\) = 6.6 Hz)].[3a] The \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectrum of **1** had signals due to two a,b-unsaturated carbonyls (\(\delta\) 187.89 and 190.22), two ester carbonyls (\(\delta\) 178.73 and 178.82), and fourteen aromatic/olefinic carbons. These data suggested that **1** is a dimeric calcristoloid consisting of quinonemethide and 6-oxo-phenolic subunits. The presence of a D2O exchangeable signal at \(\delta\)H 5.11 and a dioxygenated carbon signal at \(\delta\)c 91.98 was indicative of a dimer joined by two other linkages formed between the A rings of the two monomeric units. Oxidative coupling of quinonemethide and 6-oxo-phenolic subunits would give rise to two regioisomers (having C2'-O-C3-C4-O-C3' and C2'-O-C4-C3-O-C3' ether linkages) each with two stereoisomers. Analysis of the HMBC spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of a weak long-range correlation between CH3-23 and C3' suggesting C2'-O-C3-C4-O-C3' geochemistry for **1** which was confirmed by the proton chemical shift of CH3-23' (\(\delta\) 2.74),[46, h-j] and the NOE between H-6 and CH3-23' in its ROESY spectrum. The CH3-23' signals of its regioisomers (isoxuxurines) have been reported to occur in the region \(\delta\) 2.48-2.52,[46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100

into 6-oxo-pristimerol (**6**) followed by (oxidative) coupling with pristimerin. We have previously demonstrated that the oxidation of pristimerol with _N_-bromosuccinimide produces 6-oxo-pristimerol (**6**).7 As depicted in Figure 2, it is possible that **6** could be formed from pristimerin (**4a**) by the addition of water to its quinonemethide system followed by oxidation with DDQ. Coupling of **4a** and **6** to produce **1** and **2** with C4-O-C3' linkage may then occur through oxidized pristimerin (**7**) or oxidized 6-oxo-pristimerol (**8**). It is noteworthy that the intermediacy of _ortho_-quinones related to **8** has been implicated in the biosynthesis of xuavaines,4e scutidins,4f and triscutins.8 However, the formation of **3** during the DDQ oxidation of pristimerin (**4a**) suggests the possible intermediacy of **7** in the formation of **1** and **2** (Fig. 2). Although rare, Diels-Alder-type reactions between DDQ and dienes similar to that depicted in Figure 3 are known,9 the hitherto unprecedented _retro_-Diels-Alder-type elimination of a molecule of O=C=(Cl)C-C(Cl)=C=O from the adduct **9** can be explained as due to the thermodynamic stability of the resulting aromatic product **3**. We are continuing our studies to elucidate the mechanism of DDQ-mediated biomimetic-type reaction of pristimerin (**4a**) leading to the formation of **1** and **2**.

agents and solvents for chemical reactions were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Melting points were determined on a Fisher-John's melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured with a Jasco Dip-370 polarimeter. IR spectra were for KBr disks recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8300 spectrometer. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving each compound (3.7 mg of **1**, 4.8 mg of **2**, and 3.1 mg of **3**) in 0.5 mL of CDCl3 (0.05% TMS) in a 5 mm NMR tube. 1H and 2D NMR spectra were acquired at 25 degC on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer with a 1H frequency of 600.13 MHz, using a Nalore 5 mm inverse HCN Z-gradient probe. 13C and DEPT spectra were acquired at 25 degC on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer using a Bruker 5 mm dual (13C/1H) probe. All NMR data were acquired with over-sampling and digital filtering (decimation factor 32 for 2D, 24 for 1H and 6 for 13C) and processed using the Felix software package (Accelerys, Inc., San Diego, CA). 11 All 1D spectra were referenced to TMS at 0 ppm for 1H and CDCl3 at 77.0 ppm for 13C. HRMS were recorded on a JEOL HX110A spectrometer. TLC and prep. TLC were performed on silica gel 60 GF254 plates (Merck), whereas CC was carried out on silica gel type 60 (Baker).

### Reaction of Pristimerin with DDQ

DDQ (30.1 mg, 131.3 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of pristimerin (51.2 mg, 109.5 mmol) in freshly distilled dry dioxane (5.0 mL) at 25 degC. Reaction was monitored by TLC. After 6 h, TLC indicated the disappearance of pristimerin and its transformation to at least three products. EtOAc (150 mL) was then added to the reaction mixture and the organic phase washed with distilled water (6 x 100 mL), dried (Na2SO4) and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the crude product mixture (68.2 mg). This was adsorbed onto silica gel (200 mg) and chromatographed over a column of silica gel (3.5 g) made up in hexane and eluted with hexane followed by hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc. 10 mL fractions were collected. Fractions (13-15) eluted with 10% EtOAc in hexane were combined and purified on prep. TLC (eluant: 40% EtOAc) to give **1** (3.7 mg). Fractions (16 and 17) eluted with the same solvent were combined and purified on prep. TLC (eluant: 40% EtOAc in hexane) to give **2** (4.8 mg). Middle fractions (20-22) of the column eluted with 20% EtOAc in hexane were combined and purified on prep. TLC (eluant: 40% EtOAc in hexane) to give **3** (3.1 mg).
