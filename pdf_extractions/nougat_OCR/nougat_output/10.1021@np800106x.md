# Abstract

As part of a continuing interest in exploring the chemistry of Brazilian medicinal plants, three new labdane diterpenoids, 6a-acetopyranosyl oxide (**1**), 6a-malonyloxymanoyl oxide (**2**), and 6a-malonyloxy-_n_-butyl esteranoyl oxide (**3**), together with the known benthic acid, lupeol, sitoosterol, and sitoignosterol, were isolated from the aerial parts of _Stemodia foliosa_. The structures of **1**-**3** were established on the basis of interpretation of spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. All compounds were tested against a bacteria panel consisting of _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Bacillus cereus_, _B. subtilis_, _B. anthracis_, _Micrococcus luteus_, _Mycobacterium smegantis_, and _M. phlei_. Compound **2** showed moderate activity against these strains, with MIC values in the range 7-20 _m_g/mL.

The genus _Stemodia_ Benth. (Scrophulariaceae) is represented by 40 species distributed in Asia, Africa, Australia, and America.1 Iridoids and diterpenes are widely distributed in this genus, with the tetracyclic stemodate diterpenoids being an unusual structural type isolated from _Stemodia matrilina_,2 a plant used medicinally in the Caribbean region to treat stomachache, edema, and swelling.3

Several _Stemodia_ species are shrubs distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world.4 In Brazil, _Stemodia foliosa_ Benth., known as "meladinha", is widespread, and in the north-eastern region, it is used popularly as a bioscienecide and to treat respiratory infections.5 Our previous investigation on _S. foliosa_ resulted in the isolation of stearic acid 4-(_n_-pentoxy)phenyl ester, which showed significant activity against the Gram-positive bacteria _Bacillus cereus_ and _B. subtilis_ and the fast-acid bacterium _Mycobacterium fortuitum_.6 In the course of a program aimed at identifying new bioactive compounds from Brazilian plant species, we have investigated the ethanolic extract from the aerial parts of _S. foliosa_. This has led to the isolation of three new labdane diterpenoids, 6a-acetoxymanoyl oxide (**1**), 6a-malonyloxymanoyl oxide (**2**), and 6a-malonyloxy-_n_-butyl esteranoyl oxide (**3**), together with several known compounds, benthic acid, lupeol, stigmasterol, and sitoosterol. We report herein the isolation and characterization of **1**-**3** and their antibacterial properties.

## Introduction

The hexane phase obtained from liquid-liquid partition of a bioactive EtOH extract from the aerial parts of _S. foliosa_ gave three new compounds (**1**-**3**) after sequential column chromatographic procedures on silica gel. Compound **1** was obtained as a colorless, amorphous solid, with [ola]0 +-44.5 Electrospray-ionization MS showed a strong [M - H]+ ion peak at _m/z_ 347 (100), and HRESIMS gave a [M]+ ion at _m/z_ 348.5243, compatible with the molecular formula C22H30O3, which is consistent with a diterpene structure. IR absorptions at 1737 cm-1 indicated the presence of an ester carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum of **1** (Table 1) displayed signals corresponding to five tertiary methyls at \(d\) 1.39 (CH3-17, s), 1.23 (CH3-16, s), 1.00 (CH2-20, s), 0.87(CH3-19, s), and 0.86 (CH3-18, s), three olefinic hydrogens at \(d\) 5.86 (1H-14, dd, \(J\) = 170, 11.0 Hz), 4.83 (1H-15, dd, \(J\) = 11.0, 1.5 Hz), and 5.03 (1H-15, dd, \(J\) = 17.0, 1.5 Hz), one oxymethamine hydrogen at \(d\) 5.08 (H-6, dd, \(J\) = 11.5, 119, 4.5 Hz), and one acetyl methyl group at \(d\) 2.00 (s). From the 1C NMR spectrum (Table 1) a labdane diterpene structure type was proposed for **1**.7.8 The signals corresponding to olefinic carbons (_d_ 147.5 and 110.4) of a monosulfonated vinyl group were analyzed together with three oxygen-substituted carbons (_d_ 70.8, 74.0, 73.5) and one acetoxyl group (_d_ 170.0, 21.9) and suggested that **1** is a monosyl oxide derivative.9 Also, on the basis of 13C NMR data, the relative stereochemistry of C-16 was deduced, since the value attributed to this carbon is quite different for the monosyl oxide series (C-16, \(d\) ca. 28.5) from that in the _epi_-monosyl oxide series (C-16, \(d\) ca. 33.0),10.11 This is consistent with the NOESY spectral data (Figure 1). Thus, taking into account these considerations, compound **1** was determined to be a monosyl oxide. The acetoxyl function at C-6 was also established on the basis of 1H and 13C NMR data. The chemical shift of H-6 in conjunction with the coupling constants observed for the signal corresponding to this hydrogen (Table 1) was diagnostic for the attachment of the acetoxyl group in an a-position.12 Additionally, NOESY data permitted the determination of the relative configuration of C-6, C-16, and C-17 (Figure 1), thereby confirming **1** to be a new compound. Total assignments of 1H and 13C NMR signals were also confirmed by the COSY, TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra (Table S1, Supporting Information). Accordingly, diterpene **1** was characterized as 6a-acetoxymanoyl oxide.

than that of **1**, suggesting the presence of an additional carboxyl group. Accurate analysis of spectroscopic data including the \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{1}\)C NMR spectra (Table 1) demonstrated that compounds **1** and **2** are closely related, indicating the same diterpene skeleton for **2**. The only difference observed in the \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum of **2** was the singlet signal at \(\delta\) 3.31, instead of the signal for the acetyl group observed for compound **1**. The \({}^{1}\)C NMR and DEPT spectra revealed the presence of three additional carbons for **2** at \(\delta\) 173.9 (s), 171.1 (s), and 43.6 (t). These observations together with \({}^{1}\)H\({}^{-1}\)H COSY and HMBC data (Table S2, Supporting Information) indicated that diterpene **2** has a malonyloxy moiety at C-6. These findings were confirmed by the HMBC spectrum, due to a \({}^{3}\)J cross-peak between H-6 (\(\delta\) 5.08) and C-1 (\(\delta\) 173.9) and a \({}^{2}\)J cross-peak between H-2 (\(\delta\) 3.31) and C-1 (0 173.9) and C-3 (\(\delta\) 171.1). In addition, like diterpene **1**, the coupling constants between H-6 and H-5/H-7 (\(J\) = 10.5, 11.0, 4.8 Hz) indicated the same relative configuration for the substituent at C-6. The relative configuration of the chiral centers C-8 and C-13 in **2** were assigned by NOE correlations between CH3-16 and CH3-17 (Figure 1), in agreement with a many oxide diterpene skeleton.[78] On the basis of the above evidence, compound **2** was characterized as \(\delta\)a-malonyloxymanoyl oxide.

Compound **3** was obtained as a white, amorphous solid with [\(\alpha\)]\({}_{\rm L}\)[30] +57.0 and exhibited a molecular ion peak at [M\({}^{+}\)] _m/z_ 448.6454 in the HRESIMS, corresponding to C2:H4O3. The \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum of **3** was very similar to that of **2** (Table 1), suggesting that this compound also belongs to the many oxide diterpene series. The main chemical shift differences observed in the \({}^{1}\)H NMR spectrum were due to the additional signals at \(\delta\) 3.84

(m), 1.47 (m), 1.37 (m), and 0.93 (t, \(J\) = 7.0 Hz). These data analyzed together with the signals at \(d\) 65.6 (t), 36.1 (t), 19.9 (t), and 13.8 (q), observed in the \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectrum (Table 1), suggested the presence of a side-chain _n_-butyl in the structure of **3**. This structural feature was further corroborated by \({}^{1}\)H\(-^{1}\)H COSY analysis, which indicated one spin system (C-1 -C-2 -C-3 -C-4 ), in agreement with a _n_-alkyl unity. The HMPC correlations of H-6 (5.08) to C-1 (166.9), H-1 (3.84) to C-3 (165.6), and H-4 to C-2  revealed that the _n_-butyl unit is connected to the ester unit at C-6. This assumption was supported from the analysis of all spectroscopic data, including the NOESY, TOCSY, and HMBC spectra (Table S3, Supporting Information), which were consistent with the proposed structure, 6a-malonyloxy-_n_-butyl ester manoyl oxide (**3**).

Diterpenoids **1**-**3** were examined for their antibiotic activity toward the bacteria _S. aureus_, _B. cereus_, _B. subtilis_, _B. anthracis_, _M. luteus_, _M. snegmatis_, and _M. phlei_ (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, diterpene **2** exhibited moderate antibiotic activity, and **1** and **3** were inactive. It was also interesting to note that the malonyloxy function at C-6 seems to be an important feature for the antibacterial activity. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of **2** serves to corroborate the popular uses attributed for this plant to treat infectious respiratory diseases.

### Experimental Section

**General Experimental Procedures.** Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 IC. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X FT spectrometer with KBr pellets. \({}^{1}\)H and \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125.67 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; _e_COSY, _g_HMQC, gHMQC, bGHBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Bruker spectrometer, using ESI+ mode. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich), or Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia). TLC was carried out using silica gel 60 (>230 mesh, Merck) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldable\(-^{1}\)H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) reagent followed by heating. Preparative HPLC was performed on a preparative LC 4000 system (Waters) using C18 (250 mm x 21.20 mm, Phenomenex) columns.

**Plant Material.** The aerial parts of _Stemodia foliosa_ were collected in July 2000 in Varzea-PE, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Alda de Andrade Chiapeta. A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Botany, UFPE (UFP/19810).

**Extraction and Isolation.** The powdered, sun-dried aerial parts (1.0 kg) of _S. foliosa_ were extracted with EtOH (5 x 1 L). The EtOH extract was filtered and evaporated in vacuo to obtain a dark green, gummy residue. Then, the EtOH extract was partitioned with _n_-BuOH\(-^{1}\)H\({}_{2}\) (1:1, 3 x 1L). The _n_-BuOH extract (41.76 g) was partitioned with MeOH\(-^{1}\)H\({}_{2}\)O/hexane. The hexane extract (9.47 g) was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography and eluted with hexane\(-^{1}\)EOAc into five fractions, F-1 (6% hexane), F-2 (2.8%), F-3 (9.08%), F-4 (2.44%), and F-5 (28.68%) with hexane\(-\)AOEt (9:1). Compounds **1** (50 mg) and **2** (80 mg) were obtained by column chromatography of fraction F-2 on silica gel, eluting with hexane\(-^{-}\)EOAc (9:1). Compound **3** (40 mg) was obtained by column chromatography of fraction F-5 on silica gel, eluting with hexane\(-^{-}\)EOAc (1:1).
