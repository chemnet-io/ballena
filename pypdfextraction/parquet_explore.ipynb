G~TTLIEB~ Laborat6rio da Produtos Naturais de Funda@o de Amparo A Pesquisa do Estado de SLo Paulo, Universidade de Sgo Paulo, Brasil (Received 9 July 1970) Abstract-The wood of Apuleiu leiocurpu (Vog.) Macbr. (Leguminosae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae) yielded (+)-pinitol, &sitosterol and ten flavones. Three of these flavones are the known compounds ayanin (X), oxyayanin-A (VIIIa) and oxyayanin-B (IX). The constitutions of the seven new flavones, apulein (Ia), 5-O-demethylapulein (Ib), apuleisin (Va), apuleitrin (Via), apuleirin (Vie), apuleidin (VIIa) and 5-O-methyl- oxyayanin-A (VIIIb) were established. A structural proposal is also advanced for leiocarpin (XVI), a new pterocarpan isolated from the bark. The unusual oxygenation pattern of the flavones is discussed. INTRODUCTION Apuleia leiocurpa (Vog.) Macbr. (= A. pruecox Mart.) (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) is a tree which may attain considerable proportions. The fine-textured durable yellow timber is highly appreciated for heavy construction, flooring, door frames, wheel-wright work, shafts of vehicles and fence posts.’ The species occurs over a huge territory from Northern Argentine. Ducke cites also A. molaris Spr. ex Bth, which grows in the Amazon valley.2 More recently, however, the opinion prevails that the genus Apuleia Mart. is monotypic and that A. leiocarpa is the binomial to be retained. 3 We have compared, by TLC, extracts of different parts of specimens of A. molaris, collected near BelCm, Para State, and classified by the botanist J. MurGa Pires, and of A. Zeiocarpa, collected near Brasilia, D. F., and classified by the botanist E. P. Heringer, and were unable to detect any difference in chemical composition. The trunk of the last mentioned specimen was separated into heartwood, sapwood and bark, which were extracted separately. By a combination of fractional crystallization and column chromatography (+)-pinitol, j?-sitosterol and nine flavones were isolated from the heartwood extract. A tenth flavone was shown to be present by TLC. The same flavones and p-sitosterol were also detected in the sapwood extract. The composition of the bark extract, however, was found to be different. Instead of the flavones, a new pterocarpan and /3- sitosterol were present. * The derivation from a flavone skeleton of the group of nine heartwood constituents was immediately apparent upon inspection of their UV spectra.

Counting the number of the methoxyl groups of the de- rivatives by NMR spectroscopy revealed that five compounds were heptaoxygenated, while three were hexaoxygenated and one was pentaoxygenated. Heptaoxygenated Flavones Two of the heptaoxygenated flavones yielded an identical methyl ether. A hydroxyl- methoxyl count revealed that one of the parent compounds, for which we propose the name apulein, is a dihydroxypentamethoxyflavone (Table 1, Compound Ia), and the other one is a trihydroxytetramethoxyflavone (Table 1, Compound Ib). The hydroxylproton signals in the NMR spectra of apulein (2.00 and 4.55~) and of the trihydroxyflavone (-2.28, 2.13 and 4.67~) indicated not only that a pair of OH groups may be situated in identical environ- ments in both compounds, but also that the additional hydroxyl in the latter compound must be strongly chelated. The structure of 5-O-demethylapulein had thus to be considered for this compound. Aq. HCI promotes selective demethylation of 5-methoxyl groups in flavones4 and the use of this reagent to convert apulein to the trihydroxy derivative confirmed their structural relationship. The two remaining hydroxyls must be located in different environments, the one represented by a proton signal at about 27 (Table I, Compounds Ia and b) being involved in a weak intramolecular hydrogen bond. Since a hydroxyl at position 3 gives rise to a proton signal at about 0*5~,~ the OH group in question was placed at C-2’, where it would be T ABLE 2.

This seemed reasonable, if considered in conjunction with evidence pointing to the presence of the other hydroxyl at the para position: The UV spectrum of apulein is not altered upon addition of AlCl3, H3B03 or NaOAc,6 but revealed that decomposition of the substance takes place upon addition of NaOH. A preliminary indication of the localization of the four methoxy groups in the partial structures of apulein (IIa) and 5-O-demethylapulein (IIb) was obtained by mass spectro- metry. The well known fragmentation mode, through compensated displacement of electrons in the heterocycle,7*8 led to ions (Table 2, Compounds Ia and Ib) whose mass revealed the presence of two of these methoxyls in ring A, while the third one must be located either on the heterocycle or, together with the fourth one, on ring B. These assignments, however, 6 L. JURD, in The Chemistry of Flavonoid Compounds (edited by T. A. GEISSMAN ), p. 107, Pergamon Press, Oxford (1962). ’ C. S. BARNES and J. L. Occo~o~~~z, Australian J.

Not only are the pertinent ions of low relative abundance, but, as Table 2 also shows, fragments of identical mass may be formulated as arising either from ring A (ions V) or ring B (ions X). Confirmation was secured through the more reliable information contained in Table 3. Loss of 43 mass units from the molecular ion, as featured in the reactions M+ 0 + S and M + S, is typical of 3-methoxyflavones.9 Since at this stage the presence of a hydroxyl at position 2’ had already been ascertained, the highly favoured losses of 17 (M --f P) and of 31 mass units (M + R) were to be expectedlO and constitute additional evidence for the presence of a methoxyl group at C-3. Mass spectral analysis thus authorized the expansion of the partial formula Ha and b respectively to IIIa and b. The proton signals in the aromatic region of the NMR spectra of all apulein derivatives (Table 1, Compounds Ia-e) were represented by singlets, indicating the absence of ortho or meta related aromatic hydrogens. This fact assigned the methoxyl of ring B to position 4’. The NMR signals at 2.7 and 3.4~ had, consequently. to be correlated with the protons at C-6’ and C-3’. The resonance frequency of the remaining aromatic proton, however, was compatible with its presence either at C-6 or at C-8, and thus was not immediately helpful to decide unequivocally between two structural alternatives. Definite proposals concerning the structures of apulein and of 5-0-demethylapulein could be advanced only after degradation experiments. Alkaline hydrolysis of apulein led to a m i x t u r e o f 6’-hydroxy-2,2’,3’,4’-tetramethoxyacetophenone and of 6-hydroxy-2,3,4- trimethoxybenzoic acid. These fragments must correspond to ring A, since under the conditions ring B must have been destroyed. The substitution pattern of ring B could be defined after alkaline degradation of di-0-ethylapulein which led, in addition to the previous fragments, to 4-methoxy-2,5-diethoxybenzoic acid. Di-0-methylapulein, when submitted to the reaction, yielded, 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid. All these degradation products were characterized by physical and spectrometric means and by direct comparison with authentic samples. Clearly, they not only defined the localization of all oxygen functions, but also corroborated the assumption that the compounds are flavones. Accordingly, apulein must be 2’,5’-dihydroxy-3,4’,5,6,7-pentamethoxyflavone (Ia) and 5-0-demethylapulein must be 2’,5,5’-trihydroxy-3,4’, 6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (Ib). Once the structures of the apuleins had been established, it became necessary to re- interpret an experimental fact which did not fit the 5,6,7-oxygenation pattern for the apuleins. Nitric acid is known to effect oxidative demethylations leading to para-quinones” and treatment of apulein and of 5-0-demethylapulein with this reagent led to a single red quinone. This was reduced to a quinol which was acetylated without purification. NMR spectrometry revealed the product to be the trimethoxytetraacetoxyflavone of structure Ie, since a signal at relatively low field places one of the four acetyl groups at C-5 of the flavone skeleton.12 Treatment of apulein and of 5-0-demethylapulein with nitric acid thus afforded the quinone IV and it must be concluded that nitric acid produces not only para, but also ortho-quinones. A reaction of this type, involving chromic oxide-acetic acid as the reagent, has been reported .l 3 The oxygenation pattern of apuleisin, a third heptaoxygenated flavone of Apuleiu leiocarpa, differs from the pattern of the apuleins only with respect to ring B.

The flavones of Apuleia Ieiocarpa 2439 ment with alkali, 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzoic acid, besides the 6’-hydroxy-2,2’,3’,4’-tetra- methoxyacetophenone which had also been obtained upon degradation of the apuleins. The ortho relationship of the two ring B protons which was thus indicated, could also be appreciated through examination of the NMR spectrum of apuleisin (Table 1, Compound Va) which shows two ortho split doublets at 2.76 and 3.26 7. As in 5-Q-demethylapulein, two of the free hydroxyls in apuleisin must occupy positions 5 and 2’, since their protons also gave rise to NMR signals respectively at -2.24 and 2.027. Both these hydroxyls form part of ortho-dihydroxy systems. This was ascertained by heating apuleisin with dichlorodiphenylmethane. As indicated by mass spectrometry (Tables 2, and 3, Compound Vd), a diphenylmethylenedioxydihydroxy trimethoxyflavone resulted. The two hydroxyls of this derivative form an ortho-quinol function involving the hydroxyl at C-5, since the compound is labile in alkali and originates a PMR signal at -2.53 7 (Table 1, Compound Vd). On this evidence, the structure 2’,3’,5,6-tetrahydroxy-3,4’,7-trimethoxy- flavone (Va) is proposed for apuleisin. Apuleitrin and apuleirin, the fourth and fifth heptaoxygenated flavones of Apuleia Zeiocarpa, again yielded an identical methyl ether. Apuleitrin differs structurally from apuleisin (Va) only with respect to ring B. Indeed, while its mass spectrum (Tables 2 and 3, Compound VTa) reproduces fully all peaks originating through fragmentation of ring A of apuleisin, alkaline degradation of tri-O-methylapuleitrin afforded 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid. The structure of this methyl ether must consequently be represented by VIb. Con- firmation was obtained by direct comparison with 3,3’,4’,5,5’,6,7-heptamethoxyflavone prepared by methylation of 3’,5,5’-trihydroxy-3,4’,6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (VIc) kindly supplied by Prof. P. R. Jefferies.14 The mass spectral indication of the substitution of ring A in apuleitrin was confirmed by NMR and UV spectrometry. The existence of a chelated hydroxyl (-2.43 T, Table 1, Compound Via) and of an ortho-dihydroxy-system (positive shift in U.V. spectrum with borate) was easily demonstrated. At this point only the relative site of one hydroxyl and two methoxyls at positions 3’, 4’ and 5’ remained to be established. The protons at C-2’ and 6’ of apuleitrin gave rise to a single NMR band at 2.64 7 (Table 1, Compound Via). In spite of this fact, ring B must be asymmetrically substituted, because the corresponding signals in the spectrum of tri-O-acetylapuleitrin were characterized by two distinct chemical shift values (Table 1, Compound VId). Only 3’,5,6-trihydroxy-3,4’,5’,7-tetramethoxyflavone (Via) can thus represent the structure of apuleitrin. Apuleirin is a dihydroxypentamethoxy derivative (Table 1, Compound Vie). Since the structure of its methyl ether VIb had already been determined, only the relative positions of the substituents remained to be established. NMR (Table 1, Compound Vie) and UV data (no shift with A1C13) showed the absence of hydroxyls from both the 3- and 5-positions. The NMR spectrum contains a two-proton singlet at 2.55 7 which can only be attributed to the hydrogens at C-2’ and 6’. The magnetic equivalence of these protons does not persist in apuleirin acetate, since they are represented by two meta-split doublets in the spectrum of this derivative (Table 1, Compound VIf). Asymmetric substitution of ring B requires the presence of a hydroxyl at C-3’. The only alternative asymmetric substitution pattern, namely a 3’,4’-dihydroxy-5’-methoxy grouping, could be ruled out, because apuleirin is stable in alkali and no alteration of its W spectrum was observed upon addition of H,BO,. Absence of a paramagnetic shift of the H-8 NMR signal upon acetylation, and a bathochromic shift of the UV band II upon addition of NaOAc,6 can only be rationalized if I4 P. R. JEFFERIE, J. R. KNOX and E. J. MIDDLETON , Australian J. Chem. 15,532 (1962). 2440 R. BRAZ FILHO and 0. R. GO~LIEB the remaining OH group is at C-6. The mass spectral data (Tables 2 and 3) are in accord with the structure of 3’,6-dihydroxy-3,4’,5,5’,7-pentamethoxyflavone (We) which was consequently assigned to apuleirin. Hexaoxygenated Flavones The distribution of hydroxyls and methoxyls on the skeleton of apuleidin, one of the hexaoxygenated flavones, was determined by mass spectrometry (Table 3, Compound VIIa). The masses of ions of types T, U and V (Table 2, Compound VIIa) indicated the existence of a hydroxy-methoxylated A-ring, while the masses of the ions Y and 2 were compatible with a dihydroxy-methoxylated B-ring. The UV spectrum revealed the vicinal relationship of the two hydroxyls in ring B (spectral shifts with H,BO, and decomposition in NaOH). Consequently, when the characteristic bands at -2.46 and 1.95 7 were found in the NMR spectrum of apuleidin (Table 1, Compound VIIa), the location of the hydroxyls at positions 5 and 2’,3’ had to be considered. The same spectrum indicated also the presence of four aromatic protons in meta and ortho related pairs. The chemical shifts of the corresponding signals suggested their situation respectively on ring A and ring B. All these data lead to structure 2’,3’,5-trihydroxy-3,4’,7-trimethoxyflavone (VIIa) for apuleidin. The fully 0-methylated derivatives of the two other hexaoxygenated flavones isolated from Apuleia leiocarpa were identical. Mass spectra characterized one of the parent com- pounds (Table 3, Compound VIIIb) as a dihydroxy tetramethoxyflavone and the other one (Table 3, Compound VIIIa) as a trihydroxytrimethoxyflavone. The NMR spectra indicated, through a proton signal at -2.35 7, the presence of a 5-OH group only in the trimethoxy- flavone (Table 1, Compound VIIIa). This suggested again a 5-OMe/5-OH relationship and, indeed, the tetramethoxyflavone was easily converted into the trimethoxyflavone upon heating with aqueous HCl. UV, NMR (Table 1, Compound VIIIa) and mass spectral (Tables 2 and 3, Compound VIEIa) measurements, as well as degradation by alkali (see Experimental), indicated that the 5-hydroxy-compound was 2’,5,5’-trihydroxy-3,4’,7-trimethoxyflavone (VIIIa) and the 5- methoxy-compound 2’,5’-dihydroxy-3,4’,5,7-tetramethoxyflavone (VIIIb). VIHa is the structure of oxyayanin-A, a constituent of Distemonanthus benthamianus.15 Jain et aLI6 synthesized 2’,5,5’-trihydroxy-3,4’,7-trimethoxyflavone (VIIIa) and found it to be different, by IR spectroscopy, from a sample of oxyayanin-A supplied by Prof. F. E. King, although they recorded close agreement in colour reactions, UV spectra and m.p. This, in addition to the fact that the reportedI procedure for the isolation of oxyayanin-A from Distemonanthus benthamianus included alkaline treatment which destroys VIIIa, forced the Indian workers to consider the structural proposal VIIIa advanced for the natural compound as erroneous,16,17 and stimulated Dreyer and Bertelli to suggest that a 2’,6’- disubstituted B-ring might be present in oxyayanin-A.18 Such a hypothesis would, of course, never have been formulated, had the authors been able to examine the NMR spectrum. This shows (Table 1, Compound VIIIa) two doublets whose chemical shifts and coupling constant allow correlation only with protons at C-6 and C-8, and two singlets revealing a pair of para related protons. These can only be placed on ring B, which must consequently be substituted at positions 2’,4’ and 5’. I5 F. E. KING, T. J. KING and P. J. STOKES, J. Chem. Sot. 4587 (1954). I6 A. C. JAIN, S. K.

The tlavones of Apuleia leiocarpa 2441 We were able to identify the 5hydroxytlavone of Apuleia leiocarpa with oxyayanin-A by direct comparison (IR and UV spectra, TLC and mixed m.p.) with an authentic sample from Dr. T. J. King. Consequently, when Prof. T. R. Seshadri kindly informed us that he found our oxyayanin-A ex A, leiocarpa identical with his synthetic VIIIa, the structural proposal originally advanced for oxyayanin-A was established as correct, and the remaining question concerned only the nature of the sample which had been sent from Nottingham to Delhi. This problem was solved when it was found that oxyayanin-A, crystallized from ethyl acetate-light petroleum, ethyl acetate-benzene or methanol, gave an i.r. spectrum (in KBr) identical with that published by Seshadri et al.I6 for synthetic VIIIa. When oxyayanin-A, however, was dissolved in chloroform and the solvent removed by evaporation, the residue, although indistinguishable from oxyayanin-A by UV all other methods, gave rise to an IR spectrum (in KBr) identical to that published by Seshadri et a1?6 for the natural oxyayanin- A received from England. Distemonanthus benthamianus Baill. is an African timber closely akin to Apuleia leio- carpa. lg Interestingly, both species belong to monotypic genera. The finding of oxyayanin-A in A. leiocarpa stimulated the search for other constituents of D. benthamianus in the Brazil- ian species. Indeed, the presence in the corresponding extract of still another hexaoxygena- ted flavone, namely oxyayanin-B (IX): 5 could be demonstrated by TLC. Pentaoxygenated Flavone The sole pentaoxygenated flavone isolated from A. leiocarpa was, at this stage, identified easily through spectral measurements (cf. Tables l-3, Compound X; Experimental) with yet another constituent of D. benthamianus, namely ayanin (X).“” Mass Spectra Table 4 summarizes some of the mass spectral data contained in Table 2. Clearly, the substitution at C-2’ and 6’ of 3-methoxyflavones can be recognized upon examination of the relative abundances of their M-l, M-17 and M-31 ions. Absence of substitution confers high stability to the molecular ion, favouring only the expulsion of a hydrogen atom. Substitution by hydroxyl favours the expulsion of OH and OMe radicals, while substitution by methoxyl favours expulsion only of OMe. T ABLE 4.

BRAZ FILHO and 0. R. GOTTLIEB Leiocarpin The aromatic constituent of A. leiocarpa bark was classified as a pterocarpan by means of its very typical NMR21-Z3 and UV24 spectra. The mass spectrum suggested, through its molecular ion, substitution by a methylenedioxy- and a 2,2-dimethylchromene unit. The prominent M-15 peak was attributed to the benzopyrilium ion, formed by loss of a methyl radical from the chromene portion of the molecule. Direct assignment of the substituents to rings A or B of the pterocarpan skeleton through mass spectrometry was not feasable for, as shown previously,8*25 the major fragments can be reasonably formulated as arising from either ring (e.g. XI, XII). As expected, however, the interpretation of the mass spectrum of the isoflavan, derived from leiocarpin by catalytic hydrogenation, was straightforward. The retro-Diels Alder fragmentation mode yielded the ions XIII and XIV in high relative abundance. The 2,Zdimethylchromane-group can thus be located only on ring A, while the methylenedioxy-group must occupy positions of ring B. The aromatic region of the NMR spectrum of the isoflavan showed four bands, each representing one proton : two doublets centered at 3.16 and 3.70 T (J 8.6 Hz) and two singlets at 3.31 and 3.49 T. Clearly, the chemical shift of the low field signal reveals the existence of a proton which keeps neither an ortho- nor apara relationship to an oxy-group,26 a condition which can be met only by a H at C-5 of a C-7-oxygenated A-ring. Since the proton signal under scrutiny is characterized by an ortho-coupling constant, a second H must occur at C-6. The ring B protons gave rise to two singlets and must be para related. Structure XV had consequently to be assigned to the tetrahydrogenated derivative of leiocarpin. The 3S-configuration for the isoflavan XV was deduced upon inspection of its ORD curve. This showed a negative Cotton effect in the 260-300 nm region, in analogy with the curves of known 3S-isoflavan?’ which do not bear an additional substituent at C-6.25 It was now possible to formulate structure and configuration of leiocarpin (XVI) on the reasonable assumption that the heterocyclic rings are cis fused.28 Confirmation of the structure was provided by all features of the NMR spectrum. Observed (3.31, 3.58~) and expected (3.40, 3.66~)~~ chemical shift values for the singlets due to the C-7 and C-10 protons are in agreement. Confirmation of the absolute configuration was obtained by inspection of the ORD curve. This followed, between 3.50 and 220 nm, precisely the course expected for 6aS,l IaS- pterocarpans.25v29 D I S C U S S I O N Methylation of the 4’-hydroxyl in preference to the 3’-hydroxyl is relatively rare in natural flavonoids.30 Two additional conspicuous examples are eupatin (XVIIa) and eupa- toretin (XVIIb), not only on account of their close structural relationship with oxyayanin-B (IX), but also because they show moderate cytotoxicity against human carcinoma of the nasopharynx.31 * 1 D.

POSTULATED DERIVATION OF B-RING OXYGENATION IN FLAVONES ISOLATED FROM A. leiocarpa. The postulated derivation of trioxygenated B-rings of Apuleia constituents from dioxy- genated precursors is presented in Chart 2. It seems obvious that the hydroxyl, and not the methoxyl, controls the orientation of electrophyllic attack by +OH to its para or oriho- positions. Effects of this nature were attributed to the ability of the hydroxyl groups to establish a hydrogen bond with the neighbouring methoxy gro~p.~~ As a result of such intramolecular hydrogen bonding, mesomeric and inductive electron release toward ortho or para positions would be expected to be enhanced for the hydroxyl, and repressed for the methoxyl. This may explain why the usual 4’-hydroxy-3’-methoxy substituion in natural diarylpropanoids leads to the usual 3’,4’,5’-trioxygenated derivatives, while, at least in Distemonanthus and Apuleia species, the unusual 3’-hydroxyd’-methoxy substitution leads to the unusual 2’,4’,5’- and 2’,3’,4’-trioxygenation patterns. That the 3’,4’,5’-oxygenation pattern is indeed usual among flavonoids was again brought out in the present work with respect to apuleitrin (Via) and apuleirin (We). Identically substituted derivatives have been located in such unrelated species as Eremo- phila fraseri F. Muell. (Myoporaceae)14 and Murraya panicdata (L.) Jack, (Rutaceae).33 In contradistinction, while 2’-hydroxylated B-rings are reasonably widespread among the isoflavonoids of the Leguminosae,34 and a proposal has been advanced which rationalizes this fact mechanistically,35 oxyayanin-A was until now the only 2’-hydroxyflavanoid 32 M.

GOTTLIEB reported in the family. Nevertheless, recent papers17,36*37 mention 27 additional repre- sentatives of this class from members of the Acanthaceae, Datiscaceae, Labiatae, Meliaceae, Moraceae and Rutaceae. Their biosynthesis, however, does not necessarily follow the course which is suggested for the Apuleia constituents, and at least some of these com- pounds may be derived by some departure from the usual acetate-shikimate patbway.38 Finally, it has been reported that ayan wood (Distemonanthus benthdmianus) may cause dermatitis due to the presence of oxyayanin-A and oxyayanin-B.39 Clearly, this is another indication designed to stimulate an investigation into the physiological activity of the con- stituents of garapa wood (Apuleia leiocarpa). EXPERIMENTAL NMR spectra were determined in CDC13 using TMS as an internal standard. M.ps were determined using a Kofler hot stage microscope and are uncorrected. Separations by column chromatography were carried out usine Merck KieselaelO~O5-0~20 mm. Merck’s Kieselael G was used for TLC. During isolation processes the appropriate combination of fractions was determined by examination of their i.r. spectra and TLC behaviour. TLC plates were examined under UV illumination and after exposure to iodine vapour. The majority of NMR and mass spectral figures are given in Tables 1-3. Isolafion of Apuleia Constituents Benzene extraction of the heartwood of A. leiocarpa. Isolation of ten/?avones and j-sitosterol. The powdered heartwood (5.0 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene. Upon partial evaporation of the solvent separated an oil which solidified by standing (Hi). Further concentration of the benzene solution produced a crystalline precipitate which was separated into an acetone insoluble (HZ) and an acetone soluble portion. The acetone soluble portion was chromatographed on silica giving fractions H3-Hs, in this order, by elution with benzene-AcOEt(l:l). Two more successive crops of crystals (H, and Hs) of the original benzene solution were collected. The remaining benzene solution was divided into two parts, Hg and Hro. Hi was washed with a small quantity of benzene, and freed from an insoluble portion by treatment with CHC13. The CHCI,-solution was evaporated. The residue, purified by passage of its methanol solution through a column of Sephadex LH-20 gelified with methanol, and recrystallizations from the same solvent, afforded apuleisin (Va, 530 mg). HZ was recrystallized from acetone yielding apulein (Ia, 1.5 g). H3 was recrystallized from benzene- AcOEt yielding oxyayanin-A (VIIIa, 160 mg). H4 was recrystallized from benzene yielding 5-O-demethyl- apulein (Ib, 180 mg). H5 was recrystallized from acetone yielding apulein (Ia, 900 mg). Hs was recrystallized from acetone yielding 5-O-methyloxyayanin-A (VIIIb, 140 mg). H, was recrystallized from acetone, purified by chromatography on silica, elution with benzene-AcOEt(1 :l), and recrystallization from methanol, yielding ayanin (X, 9 mg). Hs was recrystallized from ethanol yielding apuleisin (Va, 40 mg). Hg was evaporated. The ethanol soluble part of the residue was chromatographed on a polyamide column. Benzene- MeOH 12:l eluted a product in which the presence of oxyayanin-B (IX) was detected by TLC (silica CHCI,). H,,, was partially evaporated. An oil precipitated and was separated. Treatment of this oil with MeOH produced a crystalline mass which was shown by TLC to be composed of 5-O-demethylapulein (Ib), apuleisin (Va) and oxyayanin-A (VIIIa). The filtered MeOH solution was concentrated to a small volume and chroma- tographed through a column of Sephadex LH-20 gelified with MeOH. In order of elution were collected p-sitosterol (30 mg), a fraction which after recrystallization from AcOEt-light petroleum yielded apuleitrin (Via, 30 mg), and a fraction which after recrystallization from MeOH yielded ayanin (X, 25 mg). Further evaporation of benzene from the original H,,-solution afforded a second crop of oily precipitate which was again treated with MeOH. The crystals were collected and again shown by TLC to be composed of 5-O-demethylapulein (Ib), apuleisin (Va), and oxyayanin-A (VIIIa). The filtered MeOH solution was evaporated and the residue dissolved in CHCI,. This solution was extracted several times with cont. aqueous borax. The aqueous layers were united, washed with CHCI,, acidified with HCl and extracted with CHCI,. The CHCI,-solution was washed with water, dried, evaporated and the residue (1.9 g) chromatographed on silica (60 g). In order of elution with benzene-AcOEt were collected a fraction which 36 P C PARTHASARATHY, P. V. RADHAKRISHNAU, S. S. RATHI and K. VEUKATARAMAN, Indian J. Chem. 7, iol(1969). 37 T. R.

The flavones of Apuleia leiocarpa 2441 after recrystallization from CCL yielded apuleidin (VIIa, 129 mg), a fraction which after recrystallization from acetone-light petroleum yielded apuleitrin (Via, 109 mg), and a fraction which after recrystallization from benzene-MeOH yielded apuleirin (Vie, 22 mg). In the mother-liquor, which remained after the filtration of apuleitrin, the presence of oxyayanin-B (IX) was demonstrated by TLC. Ethanol extraction of the heartwood of A. leiocarpa. Isolation of (+)-pinitol. The ground wood, after extraction with hot benzene, see above, was continuously extracted with EtOH. Partial evaporation of the solvent produced a crystalline deposit which through recrystallization from EtOH yielded (+)-pinitol(72mg). Benzene extraction of the sapwood of A. leiocarpa. The powdered sapwood (10.0 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene. Upon removal of the solvent a residue (100 g) remained. Column or TLC revealed the presenceof apulein(Ia), 5-O-demethylapulein(Ib), oxyayanin-A(VIIIa), 5-0-methyloxyayanin-A (VITIb), apuleisin (Va), apuleitrin (Via), ayanin (X) and fl-sitosterol. Benzene extraction of the bark of A. leiocarpa. Isolation of h-sitosterol and Ieiocarpin (XVI). The powdered bark (1.2 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene.’ Evaporation of the solvent yielded a residue (16 g), part of which (3 g) was chromatographed on silica (90 g). Elution with benzene-CHCla (9:l) afforded B-sitosterol(70 mg) and a fraction which after recrystallization from EtOH yielded leiocarpin (XVI, 130 mg). Apulein and Derivatives Apulein (Ia).

VIEIRA* and ISAO KUBO Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natural Resources, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. (Received in revised form 12 August 1989) Key Word Index--G&pea bracteata; Rutaceae; stems; quinoline alkaloids; plant growth inhibitor; molluscicidal activity. Abstract-Four quinoline alkaloids were isolated from stems of Gnlipea bracteata. In addition to one new compound, 2-(3’,4’-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)-quinoline, three were identified as the known compounds 2+propylquinoline, 2- n-pentylquinoline and 2-(l’-pentenyl)-quinoline. However, this is the first report of their isolation from a natural source. All alkaloids showed an inhibitory effect on shoot and root growth of lettuce (Lactuca satiua). Three of them also showed molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis. INTRODUCTION The Rutaceae is represented by a great number of species in tropical areas. Many of these species have never been the target of a phytochemical investigation. In our con- tinuing effort to find biologically active compounds we have investigated G&pea bracteata. In this paper we report the isolation and identification of one new alkaloid and three known ones from G. bracteata collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The growth inhibitory effect against lettuce of the alkaloids, as well as, their molluscicidal activity are also described. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The dichloromethane extract of the stems of G. bracteata afforded four alkaloids 14. The combination of various routine ‘H, 13C NMR and mass spectrometric analyses allowed us to attribute the formulas C,,H,,N. C,,H,,N. C,,H,,N and C,,H,,NO, to compounds 14, respect- ively. ‘H NMR (Table 1) showed signals of six aromatic protons for all compounds at 67.24 f0.04, d, J= 8.5 Hz, H-3; 68.02kO.02 d, J=8.5 Hz, H-4; 67.74kO.02, dd, .I =7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-5; 67.47+0.04, td, J=7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-6; S7.66kO.04, td, J=7.8, 1.2 Hz, H-7 and 68.01 +O.Ol, d, .I = 7.8, H-8. An exception was the signal corresponding to H-3 of compound 3 at 67.51. The similarities of the chemical shifts and multiplicities for the four compounds suggest that a 2-substituted quinoline system is the structural basis for all compounds, and that the difference between them is the type of substituent attached to C-2. Compound 1 possesses a n-propyl moiety characterized by the signals in the ‘HNMR at 62.91 (t), 61.81 (sext, J * Permanent address: Departamento de Quimica, Universi- dade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, CEP 13560, Brazil. = 7.4 Hz), 60.91 (t), integrating 2: 2: 3, respectively. Con- firmation of this unit can be taken from the 13CNMR signals at 641.30,23.25 and 13.99, which can be attributed to C-l’, C-2’ and C-3’, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are very closely related to each other and to compound 1. The mass spectra showed the parent peak at m/z 199 and 197 for 2 and 3 respectively, indicating that the difference between 2 and 3 is two hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the ‘H NMR of both com- pounds showed that 2 has two more signals in the olefinic region C66.80 (td) and 66.70 (d)] than 3 and revealed the presence of a trans-substituted double bond in 3. The signal of four aliphatic protons at 61.30 (m) for 2 was observed, which corresponds to two methylene carbons. The 13CNMR for compounds 2 and 3 showed 14 signals. For 2 there were five signals at high field indi- cating a n-pentyl moiety. However, for 3 there were only three signals in this region. These data indicate that 2 has a n-pentyl chain attached to C-2 and that 3 has the corresponding pentenyl chain. Compound 4 is related to the three compounds de- scribed above. Analysis of its ‘H and 13CNMR spectra reveals that, in addition to the quinoline ring, there is another aromatic ring present in the molecule. The tri- substituted nature of this ring is confirmed by the signals 66.72 (d, 5=1.2 Hz), 66.69 (d, J=7.8 Hz), 66.65 (dd, J 1 R=\\;f\\ 3 813 814 P. C. WEIRA and I.

The presence of a piperonyl moiety is once more confirmed by the mass spectrum which show- ed a peak at m/z 135. The parent peak of m/z 217 requires a methylenedioxyphenylethyl as the substituent of this quinoline. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. The compounds 2- methyl (5) and 2-aminoquinoline (6) were used as models c121. The alkaloids isolated showed inhibitory effects on the growth of lettuce seedlings and molluscicidal activity as determined according to the methods described pre- viously [3,4]. All compounds at concentrations larger than 500ppm inhibited both shoot and root growth in the lettuce test. At lower concentrations their activities were diminished. When the concentration was decreased to 100 ppm, only compounds 3 and 4 showed activity but at this concentration. 1 and 2 had no activity. Molluscicidal activity was exhibited by compounds 2-4. Compound 1 was not molluscicidal even at 100 ppm. Compound 4 had the most powerful molluscicidal activ- ity killing snails at a concentration of only 5 ppm. Com- pounds 2 and 3 possessed activities at 20 and 10 ppm, respectively. Our results suggest that the presence of a second aromatic ring at C-2 increases the activity of the com- pounds, and that the activity of 2-alkylquinolines de- pends on the length of the alkyl chain. It is important to note that very few examples of naturally occurring alka- loids have been found to exhibit molluscicidal activity [S]. although recently, some potent molluscicidal alka- loids were isolated from members of the Meliaceae [S]. It is also important to mention that few species of the genus Gu/ipeu have been studied. However, in a unique example presented by Mester [7], the alkaloids isolated were 7- substituted quinolines. We suspect that there should be a tendency for this genus to produce this class of com- pound. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of constituents. Galipea hracteata was collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil; a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Institute de Biociencias. USP, Sao Paulo. Dried stems (920 g) were extd with CH,CI, at room temp. for 4 days. The ext was evapd to dryness yielding (5.567 g) ofcrude extract. A portion of this ext (1.463 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (50 g) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH,CI,, EtOAc and MeOH). Alkaloids were found in frs 16.-35. They were then sepd by low pressure chromatography on silica gel (Lichroprep) using hexane-EtOAc (49: l), affording I (31 mg), 2 (IOmg). 3 (15 mg) and 4 (I 13 mg).
